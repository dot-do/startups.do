  problem:
    - >-
      Growers face high year-to-year variability in planting conditions, leading
      to suboptimal planting dates and stand establishment.
    - >-
      Variable-rate seeding (VRS) is underutilized due to complexity, data
      fragmentation, and lack of crop-specific, field-level recommendations.
    - >-
      Current prescriptions often ignore within-field micro-variability (soil
      texture, elevation, historical yield, moisture) and expected emergence
      rates by date.
    - >-
      Missed planting windows and over/under seeding increase replant risk,
      input costs, and reduce yield stability.
    - >-
      Agronomists and co-ops need scalable tools to create consistent,
      defensible prescriptions and document ROI to their clients.
  solution:
    - >-
      Planting Window Optimizer: 10–14 day and seasonal outlooks combining local
      microclimate, soil temperature/moisture simulations, and frost probability
      to recommend optimal windows by crop/variety.
    - >-
      Variable-Rate Seeding Generator: Creates zone-based seed rate
      prescriptions (ISO-XML/Shapefile) tuned to expected emergence by date,
      soil texture, organic matter, topography, and historical yield/NDVI.
    - >-
      Closed-loop Feedback: Compares planned vs as-planted and yield outcomes to
      retrain models; auto-adjusts prescriptions weekly in-season as forecasts
      shift.
    - >-
      Multi-crop Support: Crop- and variety-specific parameters for soybeans,
      canola, corn, wheat, barley, oats; supports air seeders and planters.
    - >-
      ROI & Risk Dashboards: Quantifies yield lift, seed savings, stand
      uniformity, and replant risk reduction at field and season levels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-specific AI that times planting to the highest-probability success
    window and generates productivity-zone VRS maps that hit target stands at
    the lowest seed cost—measurably lifting yield stability and cutting replant
    and seed waste across oilseed–grain rotations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, field-validated dataset that fuses planting date,
    microclimate forecasts, soil/zone attributes, and final stand/yield outcomes
    across oilseed–grain rotations—feeding emergence-aware VRS unique to each
    field and equipment setup. Tight OEM integrations and partner-distributed
    trials create switching costs and defensible performance claims.
