  character: >-
    Inventory and operations leaders at meat and meat product merchant
    wholesalers who need the right items in the right locations—without
    stockouts, overstock, or waste.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile demand, seasonality, contract commitments, variable lead
    times, and operational constraints. Internal: planners stuck in spreadsheets
    and guesswork, anxious about service levels and spoilage. Philosophical: you
    shouldn’t have to gamble with perishable inventory to keep customers happy.
  guide: >-
    We understand perishables and contract-driven fulfillment are hard. Our AI
    assistant delivers SKU/location-level forecasts and reorder proposals that
    honor seasonality, customer contracts, lead times, and constraints—then
    posts suggested POs or transfers to your purchasing system—so your team can
    review and approve instead of manually compiling.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: sales, inventory, item/location master, suppliers, and
    contracts. 2) Calibrate & pilot: validate accuracy, set service targets and
    constraints, review proposed orders. 3) Go live: auto-generate daily
    forecasts and replenishment proposals; approve/post POs or transfers;
    monitor KPIs and fine-tune.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo. Transitional: Get a sample forecast and reorder file
    using your data.
  success: >-
    The right products in the right quantities at the right time. Higher fill
    rates with less inventory and waste, fewer rush buys, and on-time contract
    fulfillment. Planners focus on strategy while clean, auditable POs/transfers
    flow daily—driving margin and trust.
  failure: >-
    Continued guesswork, stockouts and spoilage write-offs, missed contract
    promises, rush freight, margin erosion, and firefighting that burns time and
    customer trust.
