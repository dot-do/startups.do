leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Facilities in NAICS 324199 (asphalt, roofing materials, petroleum coke,
      wax, etc.) spend 200–600 staff hours per site annually preparing GHGRP
      (e-GGRT) and TRI (TRI-MEweb) submissions, much of it manual.
    - >-
      Spreadsheet-based calculations and ad hoc macros increase error risk
      (version control issues, hidden formula errors) leading to rework, audit
      findings, and potential penalties.
    - >-
      Data needed for GHGRP subpart C and TRI is siloed across historians (e.g.,
      PI), DCS/PLC tags, fuel invoices, production logs, and LIMS; manual data
      reconciliation is slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Complex and changing rules (e.g., TRI de minimis exemptions, metal
      compounds reporting, AP-42 factor updates, GHGRP calibration/QA
      requirements) are hard to track and operationalize consistently.
    - >-
      Facilities with intermittent throughput spikes risk exceeding GHGRP 25,000
      tCO2e thresholds or TRI activity thresholds without early warning.
    - >-
      Knowledge loss from EHS staff turnover leads to missed institutional logic
      (e.g., site-specific emission factors, abatement device efficiencies,
      material formulations).
    - >-
      Multi-site operators lack standardized, audit-ready documentation and
      audit trails across facilities, making corporate oversight and roll-ups
      difficult.
    - >-
      Deadline pressure (TRI July 1; GHGRP March 31) compresses QA time; late
      filings or resubmissions harm compliance posture and relationships with
      regulators.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to plant data sources (historians like OSIsoft PI, PLC tags, LIMS,
      ERP) and normalize activity data (fuel use, production tonnage, material
      safety data).
    - >-
      Automate GHGRP subpart C combustion and applicable process calculations,
      fuel HHV/carbon content handling, and calibration checks; compute TRI
      activity thresholds and Form R section metrics (throughput, releases,
      off-site transfers).
    - >-
      Apply a pre-built QA/QC rule library (GHGRP monitoring plan checks,
      missing data substitution logic, consistency checks vs AP-42 factors, TRI
      threshold logic, de minimis and article exemptions).
    - >-
      Generate draft e-GGRT and TRI-MEweb-ready data packages, including
      calculation logs, emission factor citations, and unit-level audit trails.
    - >-
      Provide early-warning dashboards (monthly) for threshold proximity (GHGRP
      25,000 tCO2e; TRI processing/use thresholds) and likely-reportable
      chemicals by site.
    - >-
      Enable multi-site rollups with standardized templates, approval workflows,
      and e-signatures; maintain living monitoring plans and revision control.
    - >-
      Maintain regulatory change tracking (factor updates, TRI list changes)
      with guaranteed update SLAs and release notes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut GHGRP + TRI preparation time 50–70% per site, reduce calculation/QA
    errors by 80%+, and deliver audit-ready draft filings with a domain-tuned AI
    rules engine and connectors built specifically for NAICS 324199 processes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific QA/rules library and templates tuned to 324199 unit
    operations (asphalt heaters, oxidizers, baghouses, calciners, storage tanks)
    with validated factor mappings and audit narratives, plus pre-built
    historian/ERP connectors that cut implementation to ≤30 days and create
    switching costs. Early case studies and ex-EPA/EHS advisors strengthen
    regulator trust.
