  problem:
    - >-
      Agency teams spend 2–4 hours each morning scanning news and social to
      create executive-ready briefs; this is costly, inconsistent, and delays
      client decisions.
    - >-
      Executives want a single, concise, source-backed briefing by 8am local
      time; manual processes routinely miss that SLA across time zones.
    - >-
      Information overload from fragmented tools (monitoring dashboards, alerts,
      social listening) leads to missed risks, duplicate mentions, and low
      signal-to-noise.
    - >-
      Existing monitoring platforms surface coverage but don’t produce
      actionable talking points, Q&A, or client-ready narrative tailored to
      brand voice.
    - >-
      Quality varies by analyst; turnover and late nights create errors, missed
      context, and brand/style inconsistencies.
    - >-
      Current solutions lack measurable reliability (on-time delivery,
      precision/recall of risk detection) and auditability for claims included
      in the brief.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest licensed news, social, and owned channels by brand, competitors,
      and topics; de-duplicate, cluster, and rank by impact and novelty.
    - >-
      LLM-powered summarization fine-tuned for PR to produce a 1–2 page
      executive brief: top coverage, context, implications, and recommended
      talking points/Q&A.
    - >-
      Risk and issue detection with confidence scoring (e.g., recalls, executive
      mentions, litigation, regulatory moves), with optional human-in-the-loop
      approval.
    - >-
      Quantification: sentiment, share of voice vs. competitors, volume trends,
      and notable influencer/analyst commentary with links.
    - >-
      Formatting and brand voice templates for each client, plus localization
      (EN at launch; DE/FR/ES in roadmap).
    - >-
      Delivery by 8am local time via email, Slack/Teams, and a web dashboard;
      urgent out-of-cycle alerts for breaking issues.
    - >-
      Auditability: every claim is source-linked; red flags include rationale
      and historical context.
    - >-
      Admin: multi-tenant agency workspace, per-client configurations, and
      access controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A PR-specific, executive-grade daily briefing delivered by 8am local time
    with guaranteed SLA: top verified coverage, quantified share of voice,
    emerging risks, and ready-to-use talking points—reducing analyst prep time
    by 1.5–3 hours per account per day while improving accuracy and consistency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset of agency-validated executive briefs and risk
    annotations tied to measurable outcomes (open rates, CTR, escalation
    accuracy), plus guaranteed 8am SLA across time zones and deep integrations
    with monitoring vendors—enabling consistently higher-quality, brand-voiced
    outputs and operational reliability that generic LLM tools and dashboards
    cannot match.
