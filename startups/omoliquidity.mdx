  problem:
    - >-
      Daily net liquidity forecasts are often spreadsheet-based, siloed across
      departments (Market Operations, Treasury, RTGS/Payments), and require
      manual data stitching, leading to late and less reliable OMO decisions.
    - >-
      Seasonality (tax days, salary cycles, holidays, currency in circulation,
      FX interventions) and irregular government flows are difficult to model
      consistently, causing larger-than-desired deviations of overnight rates
      from policy targets.
    - >-
      Suboptimal OMO sizing increases volatility in short-term rates, widens
      auction tails, and raises sterilization costs (tens of basis points over a
      year for mid-sized markets).
    - >-
      Limited explainability and auditability of in-house models hinder model
      risk governance and continuity amid staff rotation/turnover.
    - >-
      Fragmented data pipelines (RTGS, reserve accounts, government cash
      balance, securities settlement, FX, currency in circulation) increase
      operational risk and reduce timeliness.
    - >-
      No unified what-if and scenario engine to quantify impacts of policy
      events, tax calendars, or exogenous shocks on liquidity and OMO needs in
      real time.
  solution:
    - >-
      End-to-end data ingestion from RTGS, reserve accounts, government cash
      balances, auction/settlement calendars, currency-in-circulation, FX
      operations, and seasonal macro/payment calendars.
    - >-
      Hybrid time-series + structural flow models that decompose net liquidity
      into predictable seasonality, known events, and stochastic components;
      confidence intervals on forecasts and recommended OMO sizes.
    - >-
      Scenario and stress-testing engine (e.g., large tax day, unscheduled FX
      intervention, settlement failures) to quantify OMO implications across T+0
      to T+30.
    - >-
      Explainable AI layer with factor attribution (which flows drive forecast),
      stability diagnostics, and backtesting dashboards with MAPE/MAE by
      horizon.
    - >-
      Actionable recommendations: daily recommended injection/absorption volumes
      with bands (base case, conservative, aggressive) against reserve target
      paths and corridor settings.
    - >-
      Integration and governance: audit trails, approvals workflow, model
      versioning, user roles, data lineage, and API integration to OMO
      auction/operation systems.
    - >-
      Deployment choices: on-premises (air-gapped) or sovereign cloud;
      low-latency updates (≤5 minutes) from RTGS for near-real-time monitoring.
    - >-
      Training and change management: capacity-building program; SOPs; model
      risk documentation aligned to central bank frameworks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Explainable, security-hardened daily net liquidity forecasts (T+0 to T+30)
    and OMO size recommendations, delivered before market open with mid-day
    updates, reducing overnight-rate deviations by 30–50%, cutting manual prep
    time by 70–90%, and providing full auditability and model governance
    suitable for central-bank standards.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built for central banks with regulatory-grade explainability, model
    governance, and pre-built RTGS/auction connectors; proven reductions in
    reserve-target deviations and operational workload; on-prem/air-gapped
    option with sovereign-cloud alternatives; deep domain team and partnerships
    enabling faster, lower-risk deployments than bespoke consulting or generic
    analytics tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Monetary authorities—central bank liquidity and market-operations teams
    (NAICS 521110) who must keep rates within the policy corridor and want
    precise daily net-liquidity forecasts with actionable OMO sizing.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented/lagged flow data, seasonality, and unpredictable
    treasury/FX/settlement/currency-in-circulation shifts obscure net liquidity.
    Internal: Morning time pressure and reputational risk from mis-sized OMOs.
    Philosophical: The public deserves a stable system—policy tools should be
    precise, transparent, and defensible.
  guide: >-
    We understand the stakes of corridor control and sterilization costs. Our
    explainable, central-bank-grade models nowcast autonomous factors on
    multi-year data; deployments are secure (on‑prem or sovereign cloud) with
    audit trails, governance, and scenario analysis.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: secure feeds for RTGS, treasury cash/tax calendars, government
    securities flows, FX, currency in circulation, reserve requirements. 2)
    Calibrate: backtest, validate, and set thresholds. 3) Operate: deliver each
    morning a net-liquidity forecast and recommended OMO size/tenor with
    rationale, scenarios, and override workflow. Optional: 90‑day pilot, SLA,
    and training.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a scoping session to launch a 90‑day pilot. Transitional:
    Request the methodology brief and sample dashboard.
  success: >-
    Tighter control of overnight rates, fewer re-openings, lower liquidity
    volatility and sterilization cost, smoother tax/holiday periods, faster
    decision cycles, and audit-ready documentation for every OMO.
  failure: >-
    Without this, desks risk rate spikes or slippage from target, costly
    over/under‑sterilization, rushed morning firefighting around large flows,
    opaque rationales, and reputational damage.
