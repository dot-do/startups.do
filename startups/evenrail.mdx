  title: Real-time Headway/Bunching Advisor
  description: >-
    Monitors fixed-guideway services (e.g., light rail, monorail, tram, people

  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent fixed-guideway services (light rail, tram, monorail, people
      movers) suffer from headway instability and bunching due to variable dwell
      times (passenger surges, wheelchair boardings, events) and small
      disturbances (door faults, signal delays).
    - >-
      Most OCCs and line controllers rely on manual rules and radio calls;
      existing ATS/SCADA tools optimize timetable adherence, not real-time
      headway regularity for frequent service.
    - >-
      Vendor ATS “regulation” features are often locked to a single OEM and
      require costly upgrades; multi-vendor networks and mixed signaling
      environments lack a unified, predictive headway tool.
    - >-
      Controllers lack predictive, actionable recommendations
      (hold/express/short-turn) with quantified passenger impacts and rule/union
      constraints; decisions are inconsistent across shifts.
    - >-
      Airports/people movers experience recurring micro-disruptions (door holds,
      crowd surges) where small, timely actions would prevent long recovery
      times, but current tools lack sub-minute forecasting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time train positions (ATS), dwell times (APC/doors), schedules
      (GTFS/plan), incidents, and platform crowd data to forecast headways 5–15
      minutes ahead with sub-5-second refresh.
    - >-
      Optimization engine proposes bounded actions (hold X sec at Station Y;
      skip Z; short-turn at W) respecting safety, union, and service policies,
      with quantified passenger-minute tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop HMI for OCC: ranked recommendations, one-click
      directives, rationale, and predicted impacts on EWT, headway SD, and
      recovery time.
    - >-
      “Shadow mode” and A/B pilots: run recommendations silently to build a
      pre-deployment ROI case using live data.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox for planners: simulate rules (max hold limits, express
      policies) and special events to tune policies before go-live.
    - >-
      APIs to integrate advisories into existing OCC/ATS screens, operator
      tablets/radios, and passenger information systems for consistent
      messaging.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vendor-agnostic, real-time headway regulation that predicts bunching minutes
    ahead and delivers safe, actionable hold/express/short-turn instructions to
    controllers and operators—cutting excess wait time 15–30% and stabilizing
    service within minutes, not hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-operator dataset and learned policies for headway stability on
    fixed-guideway systems, combined with vendor-agnostic ATS/CBTC connectors
    and an explainable, constraint-aware advisory engine that controllers
    trust—hard for OEMs to replicate quickly across mixed fleets and legacy
    OCCs.
