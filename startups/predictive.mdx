leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on extruders, laminators, chill rolls, and nip stations
      causes scrap, missed OTIF, and costly changeovers; typical event cost:
      $8,000–$15,000/hour, 4–8 hours per incident, 1–3 incidents/line/year
    - >-
      General-purpose vibration programs require heavy instrumentation and
      specialists, making small and mid-size plants opt out entirely or abandon
      pilots
    - >-
      Maintenance relies on time-based intervals that miss infant mortality
      failures of bearings, gearboxes, and motors under variable speeds/loads
      common in film/sheet
    - >-
      PLC/SCADA and VFD data is underused; plants aren’t leveraging existing
      signals (motor current, torque, roll temperature, line speed) for
      predictive insights
    - >-
      False alarms from generic anomaly tools erode trust; plants need
      domain-specific models tolerant to recipe/speed changes and nip engagement
      cycles
    - >-
      Skilled reliability talent is scarce; teams need simple, guided actions
      and CMMS-integrated work orders, not more dashboards
    - >-
      OEM warranties and service contracts don’t prevent mid-life failures;
      parts lead times (bearings, gearboxes) can be weeks, extending outages
  solution:
    - >-
      Leverage existing data first: ingest PLC/SCADA tags (motor loads, torque,
      speeds, temperatures, nip pressures) and VFD current signature analytics
      to detect mechanical/electrical anomalies without heavy sensor installs
    - >-
      Add a Lite sensor kit only where needed: 2–4 industrial accelerometers
      (magnetic/adhesive), 1 surface-temp sensor on critical bearings or gearbox
      casings; optional ultrasonic for air leaks on nips
    - >-
      Domain models for extruders/laminators: speed-order tracking and torsional
      analytics for gearboxes; nip engagement cycle segmentation; chill roll
      bearing health indices accounting for thermal growth
    - >-
      Actionable alerts, not just anomalies: root-cause likely (misalignment,
      looseness, bearing defect, lubrication issue), severity, recommended next
      action, and parts lead-time prompts
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflow: push alerts to CMMS (SAP PM, Maximo, eMaint, Fiix)
      as prioritized work orders; track completion and feedback to improve
      models
    - >-
      Rapid pilot: 90-day prove-out on 2–4 lines; ROI calculator quantifies
      downtime avoided and scrap reduced; expand by playbook across all lines
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A low-instrumentation, plug-and-play predictive maintenance service tuned
    for film/sheet lines that turns existing PLC/VFD data plus 2–4 bolt-on
    sensors into early, actionable alerts—cutting unplanned downtime 20–40%
    within 6 months, with <2 hours installation per line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-trained, recipe-aware models specifically for film/sheet extrusion and
    lamination assets that achieve high precision using existing PLC/VFD data
    plus minimal sensors—delivering reliable early warnings with <2 hours
    install per line, validated by labeled events from real film-line failures.

  character: >-
    Operations leaders and reliability/maintenance managers at plastics
    packaging film and sheet manufacturers (including laminated, NAICS 326112)
    who want predictable throughput, higher OEE, and on‑time delivery.
  problem: >-
    Villain: hidden mechanical wear in motors, gearboxes, chill rolls, and nips.
    External: sudden failures, unplanned downtime, scrap, and missed orders.
    Internal: constant firefighting, stress, and eroded trust with production
    and customers. Philosophical: critical lines shouldn’t fail in the
    dark—uptime should be planned, not left to luck.
  guide: >-
    We understand 2 a.m. extruder/laminator breakdowns and the cost of missed
    runs. Our team blends reliability engineering and industrial AI, with models
    tuned to extruder/laminator signatures, secure OT/IT practices, and proven
    results (e.g., 20–40% fewer unplanned stops in pilots).
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect non‑intrusive edge device to PLC/SCADA and add
    clamp‑on sensors for motors/gearboxes/chill rolls/nips. 2) Baseline each
    line and calibrate alerts within two weeks. 3) Act on real‑time anomaly
    alerts and weekly health reports; review and tune monthly. Agreement plan:
    Start a low‑risk 90‑day pilot on one line with clear ROI criteria; no PLC
    code changes; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute discovery call and schedule a line assessment to
    start the 90‑day pilot. Transitional: Download the ROI calculator and sample
    alert report; request a reference call.
  success: >-
    Fewer unplanned stops, higher OEE/throughput, on‑time delivery (OTIF),
    reduced scrap, longer component life, safer shifts, lower maintenance spend,
    calmer operations, and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Recurring breakdowns on motors/gearboxes/chill rolls/nips, weekend overtime
    and rush freight, missed SLAs, lost margin, chronic schedule slippage, and
    premature asset failures.
