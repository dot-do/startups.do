  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 8–20 hours per bid building surfaces, calculating
      cut/fill, and drafting mass haul diagrams in Civil 3D/AGTEK—delaying bid
      cycles and limiting the number of bids submitted.
    - >-
      Haul is 40–60% of total earthwork cost on many mass grading jobs;
      suboptimal balancing and haul routes routinely add 5–15% unnecessary cost.
    - >-
      Shrink/swell factors are often guessed or copied from old jobs; a 3–5%
      error can trigger six-figure import/export variances and change orders.
    - >-
      Design iterations (addenda, VE options) force rework; teams struggle to
      re-run quantities and haul plans quickly enough for competitive pricing.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced estimators creates capacity bottlenecks and
      inconsistent quality across bids.
    - >-
      Deliverables are inconsistent (no standard mass haul diagram, unclear
      balance regions), hurting internal reviews and client confidence.
    - >-
      Existing tools require high-skill operators and manual QA; small/mid
      contractors can’t justify full-time specialists.
    - >-
      Limited integration between quantities, geotech, and haul optimization
      leads to disconnected decisions and risk exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted ingestion of design files (Civil 3D surfaces, LandXML,
      DWG/DXF), topo (LiDAR/DEM), and geotech PDFs to compute volumes and
      material classifications.
    - >-
      Automated shrink/swell calibration using local soil types, moisture, and
      compaction specs; sensitivity bands reported (P10/P50/P90).
    - >-
      Optimization engine generates balanced zones, haul directions, and mass
      haul diagram to minimize total haul cost/time under road constraints and
      production rates.
    - >-
      Scenario analysis: alternative design grades, VE options, and
      import/export strategies with side-by-side cost deltas.
    - >-
      Standardized deliverables: cut/fill maps, balance regions, mass haul
      diagram, haul route plan, quantity takeoff CSV, annotated PDF for
      submittals, and CAD surfaces for client review.
    - >-
      Integrations to AGTEK, Trimble Business Center, and Civil 3D; export to
      Procore/PlanGrid for collaboration.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA by certified estimators; confidence score and
      assumption log for each job.
    - >-
      Turnaround SLA: 24–48 hours for typical 5–100 acre sites; rush option
      available.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, defensible earthwork volumes, shrink/swell calibration, and an
    optimized mass haul plan in 24–48 hours—cutting estimator time by 70% and

    review.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
