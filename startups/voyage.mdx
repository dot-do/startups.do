leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual consolidation of noon reports, AIS tracks, and BDNs leads to
      inconsistent fuel and emissions data, audit findings, and costly rework
      before verifier submission.
    - >-
      EU ETS exposure is volatile and material to voyage economics, but most
      owners/operators lack real-time allowance estimation per voyage/leg and
      cannot reliably accrue or hedge.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity and change: EU ETS phased coverage (40% in 2024, 70%
      in 2025, 100% from 2026), intra-EU 100% vs extra-EU 50% rules, exemptions,
      and CII tightening lead to frequent errors and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Data gaps and errors (missing noon reports, off-by-one-day timestamps,
      fuel-sulphur misclassification) cause disputes with charterers and
      verifiers; audit trails are weak.
    - >-
      Operators lack scenario tools to plan CII improvements (speed, routing,
      hull maintenance) and to quantify impact on ETS exposure and TCE.
    - >-
      Finance teams struggle to align verified MRV/DCS numbers with accruals,
      balance-sheet EUA positions, and charterparty ETS clauses for cost
      recovery.
    - >-
      Existing solutions are either heavy performance platforms or spreadsheets;
      neither provides automated, verifier-ready packs with uncertainty
      quantification and change logs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion and normalization from emails, APIs, and file
      drops for noon reports, AIS, BDNs, and port call events; OCR with ML for
      PDFs/attachments.
    - >-
      Voyage segmentation engine reconciles AIS tracks with reported events
      (departures/arrivals/bunkering) to construct legs, fuel types, and
      consumption timelines; gap-filling with probabilistic models and
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Regulatory rules engine: EU ETS coverage logic (100% intra-EU; 50%
      extra-EU), phased scope (2024: 40%, 2025: 70%, 2026+: 100%), exemptions,
      ice-class adjustments, cargo types for CII, and IMO DCS/MRV formats.
    - >-
      EUA estimator: live and forecasted EUA requirements per vessel/voyage/leg,
      with ICE EUA price feeds, accrual suggestions, and hedge quantity
      guidance; charterparty cost-allocation calculator.
    - >-
      CII analytics: near-real-time AER/EEOI tracking, year-end projection with
      “what-if” simulation (speed, RPM caps, weather routing, hull/propeller
      cleaning), SEEMP III compliance tracking.
    - >-
      Verifier-ready pack generator: complete audit trail of data sources,
      transformations, uncertainties, and change logs; direct export in
      THETIS-MRV/DCS-compatible formats and verifier portal templates.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors: push/pull to Veson IMOS, Dataloy, ShipNet, common
      ERPs, and data lakes; SSO, role-based access, and immutable ledger for
      auditability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Audit-grade, automated emissions and ETS exposure per voyage and per
    leg—built from your noon reports, AIS, weather, and BDNs—providing real-time
    EUA estimates, verifier-ready submissions, and actionable CII optimization
    with finance-grade audit trails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verifier-aligned, audit-grade pipeline that reconciles noon/AIS/weather with
    quantified uncertainty and immutable change logs, plus pre-certified
    templates that reduce verification hours by 30–50%. Fleet-specific learning
    models improve accuracy over time, and deep integrations with voyage/ERP
    systems enable finance-grade accruals and charterparty
    allocation—capabilities not matched by generic performance tools or
    spreadsheets.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Deep sea shipowners and managers (bulk, tanker, container, LNG/LPG, car
      carriers) with 10–200 vessels, EU port calls.
    - >-
      Commercial operators/time-charterers needing per-voyage ETS cost
      allocation and CII reporting to cargo owners/financiers.
    - >-
      Compliance/HSSEQ teams responsible for EU MRV, IMO DCS, and CII (SEEMP
      Part III), including interactions with verifiers.
    - >-
      CFO/treasury functions managing EUA procurement, accruals, and P&L at risk
      from EUA price volatility.
    - >-

      IMOS, Dataloy, ShipNet) to access existing customer bases.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Deep-sea shipowners, operators, and compliance teams who need accurate,
    timely fuel and emissions reporting and ETS exposure forecasting.
  problem: >-
    Manual, siloed data from noon reports, AIS, and BDNs makes MRV/IMO DCS/CII
    reporting and EU ETS allowance estimation slow, error-prone, and
    costly—leading to fines, disputes, and budget surprises.
  guide: >-
    We understand onboard and shoreside realities. Our AI reconciles voyages,
    fuel types, and consumption against current EU/IMO rules, delivering
    transparent, audit-ready calculations you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect AIS, noon reports, and BDNs via API or upload. 2) AI cleans and
    reconciles data; calculates MRV/DCS/CII and identifies ETS scope. 3) Review
    dashboards and per-voyage EU ETS allowance estimates. 4) Export filings and
    share with charterers/verifiers.
  callToAction: Book a demo and launch a two-voyage pilot.
  success: >-
    Save hours per vessel, file on time with confidence, avoid penalties and
    charterparty disputes, budget ETS accurately, and improve CII through
    actionable visibility.
  failure: >-
    Stay stuck in spreadsheets, miss deadlines, over/under-buy allowances, risk
    fines and strained counterpart relationships, and slip to worse CII ratings.
