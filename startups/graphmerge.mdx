  title: Identity Resolution and Deduping Pipeline
  description: >-
    Create a canonical entity graph by clustering duplicates across datasets
    with probabilistic/fuzzy matching and manual review of edge cases.
  targetUsers:
    - Data Engineering
    - Data Quality Leads
  triggers:
    - New dataset ingestion
    - Pre-publication QA
    - Customer dedupe request
  inputs:
    - Multiple lists with overlapping entities
    - Reference IDs (if any)
    - Match rules or business constraints
  steps:
    - 'Standardize fields (case, punctuation, address normalization)'
    - 'Generate blocking keys (phonetic, n-gram)'
    - Run probabilistic matching and cluster candidates
    - Use LLM to adjudicate ambiguous pairs with explanations
    - Route low-confidence clusters to human review
    - Assign canonical IDs and create crosswalk table
    - Publish merged master and match audit trail
  tools:
    - Dedupe.io/Splink
    - Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
    - LLM pairwise-compare agent
    - DuckDB/SQLite for joins
    - Great Expectations for QA
  outputs:
    - Deduped master file with canonical IDs
    - Crosswalk (source_id -> canonical_id)
    - Match decisions with confidence and rationale
  pricingModel:
    - Per 1k records processed
    - Add-on for ongoing incremental dedupe (monthly)

  risks:
    - Over-merge or under-merge impacting customers
    - Bias in matching rules
    - Compute cost for very large corpora
  dependencies:
    - Access to raw data
    - Data schema documentation
    - Approval for manual review of PII

  problem:
    - >-
      Directory and mailing-list publishers typically carry 2%–10% duplicate or
      near-duplicate entities across compiled sources, causing wasted postage,
      poor deliverability, and corrupted analytics.
    - >-
      Manual deduping is labor-intensive (often 200–500 hours per 10M records
      per quarter) and inconsistent, with tribal rules that don’t scale.
    - >-
      Conventional deterministic match rules fail on real-world data drift
      (nicknames, abbreviations, mergers/DBAs, address changes/NCOA,
      transliteration) leading to both false merges and missed matches.
    - >-
      Lack of a canonical entity graph across datasets prevents authoritative,
      explainable single-entity views and auditability for clients and
      regulators.
    - >-
      Poor identity resolution degrades search/browse UX (duplicate listings),
      inflates inventory counts, impairs targeting/segmentation, and increases
      UAA/RTS (Undeliverable as Addressed/Return to Sender) rates.
    - >-
      Integrations to CASS/NCOA/third-party reference files exist, but
      orchestration, human-in-the-loop review, and continuous model improvement
      are missing or ad hoc.
  solution:
    - >-
      Batch and streaming entity-resolution pipeline that clusters duplicates
      across internal and external datasets using probabilistic modeling, fuzzy
      string similarity, address normalization, and graph-based clustering.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review console for edge cases with active learning. The
      model prioritizes uncertain pairs/clusters to minimize reviewer workload
      while raising precision.
    - >-
      Canonical entity graph store with lineage: every merged attribute has
      provenance and merge rationale; complete audit trail for compliance/client
      trust.
    - >-
      Connectors: SFTP/object storage ingest; APIs for batch scoring; native
      connectors for common MDM/ETL tools (Informatica, Talend), CDPs, and USPS
      CASS/NCOA providers.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned normalizers (names, nicknames, organization variants, DBAs,
      suite/unit parsing, phone/email canonicalization) plus reference-data
      enrichment hooks (D-U-N-S, NAICS mapping).
    - >-
      Incremental updates: near-real-time cluster maintenance for new/changed
      records; configurable SLAs (e.g., 99% within 4 hours).
    - >-
      Quality and ROI reporting: duplicate-rate trend, precision/recall by
      segment, UAA reduction estimates, postage savings calculator, and A/B list
      hygiene tests.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2-ready controls, PII tokenization/hashing,
      field-level encryption; on-prem/air-gapped option for sensitive clients.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create an always-fresh, auditable canonical entity graph that cuts duplicate
    rate by 60%–90%, reduces UAA/RTS by 15%–35%, and improves match F1 to >0.95
    with human-in-the-loop assurance—without ripping and replacing your existing
    stack.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A verticalized, human-in-the-loop identity graph tuned for directory/list
    publishers with explainable matches and postal savings proof. Active
    learning across clients improves models without commingling raw PII,
    creating a compounding data network effect while preserving privacy and
    auditability. Out-of-the-box connectors to CASS/NCOA and mail workflows
    shorten time-to-savings.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Data and product leaders at directory and mailing list publishers (NAICS
    513140) who need to unify records and remove duplicates across sources
    without risking revenue.
  problem: >-
    External: fragmented datasets create duplicate and conflicting records.
    Internal: teams burn cycles on brittle manual matching and fear breaking
    counts. Philosophical: it’s wrong to mail or charge for the same person
    twice and to report inflated reach.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to ship accurate counts and protect list revenue.
    Our identity resolution pipeline blends probabilistic/fuzzy matching, graph
    clustering, and human-in-the-loop review with audit trails and
    privacy-by-design (VPC/on‑prem) options.
  plan: >-
    1) Send a sample for a free match report and dedupe estimate. 2) Configure
    match thresholds, fields, and PII policies. 3) Run the pipeline to build a
    canonical entity graph; ambiguous cases are queued for review. 4) Deliver
    clean exports/APIs with lineage, QA metrics, and monitoring.
  callToAction: Request a free match report or schedule a 30‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    A single trusted entity graph powering every list; faster releases; lower
    mailing costs; better deliverability and advertiser confidence; accurate
    counts and segments; auditable merges with fewer support escalations.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing duplicate spend and list decay, broken counts, poor deliverability,
    eroded advertiser trust, compliance risk from ad‑hoc merges, and burned‑out
    data teams.

  problem:
    - >-
      Duplicates and near-duplicates inflate circulation counts and mailing
      costs.
    - Conflicting formats and partial data stall merge-purge across providers.
    - High return mail and email bounces erode deliverability and client trust.
    - Manual matching drains editorial ops and still lets errors through.
    - No persistent IDs or history makes reissues and updates risky.
    - Lack of auditability complicates client disputes and compliance checks.

    - Cluster duplicates across datasets with probabilistic and fuzzy matching.
    - >-
      Create a canonical entity graph with persistent IDs and survivorship
      rules.

      fill rates.
  steps:
