  problem:
    - >-
      Spice and extract manufacturers face volatile input costs (spices, FX,
      ocean freight) that can move 10–40% in a quarter without early warning.
    - >-
      Supplier disruptions (weather, political, quality, compliance) at origin
      cause stockouts, expedited freight, or lost sales due to long lead times
      (8–20 weeks).
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across spreadsheets, broker emails, disparate indices,
      and manual monitoring, leading to slow reaction and poor hedging or
      contracting decisions.
    - >-
      Generic risk tools lack spice-specific coverage (e.g., NCDEX spices,
      origin microclimate, port/harvest calendars), yielding low signal-to-noise
      for category managers.
    - >-
      Procurement lacks quantified, defensible should-cost and indexation
      frameworks to negotiate contracts and justify price adjustments with
      customers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest and normalize spice price benchmarks (spot, export
      offers, NCDEX where available), FX pairs, ocean freight lanes,
      weather/remote-sensing, port congestion, regulatory and supplier
      financial/ESG signals.
    - >-
      Predict 1–6 month price/landed-cost scenarios per SKU (price + FX +
      freight + duty) with explainability and confidence bands.
    - >-
      Trigger actionable alerts (email/Slack/Teams) tied to playbooks:
      re-source, advance buy, hedge FX, adjust safety stock, or renegotiate
      indexation clauses.
    - >-
      Recommend qualified alternative suppliers by origin and certification
      (ASTA, GFSI, BRC/SQF, organic, steam-sterilized), with documented
      risk/compliance fit.
    - >-
      Provide contract-ready should-cost models and indexation formulas to
      de-risk pricing with customers and suppliers.
    - >-
      Offer API/ETL to ERP/MRP (SAP, Oracle, Infor, Dynamics) and BI tools for
      automated landed-cost updates and executive dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    The only spice-native AI that fuses commodity, FX, freight, and
    supplier-origin risk into proactive alerts and sourcing recommendations—so
    category managers act weeks earlier, lock cost, and avoid disruptions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Spice-native data and models (origin-level signals, NCDEX integration, crop
    calendars), coupled with a curated supplier/quality dataset and playbooks
    honed with ASTA-member design partners—creating a feedback flywheel of
    labeled disruptions and outcomes that generic platforms lack.

    Procurement and supply chain leaders at spice & extract manufacturers (NAICS
    311942) who need reliable, cost-stable ingredients without quality or
    compliance surprises.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile spice, FX, and freight markets + opaque supplier risk
    drive sudden COGS spikes and stockouts.

    - Internal: Teams rely on lagging spreadsheets, miss early signals, and
    struggle to justify sourcing moves.

    - Philosophical: Critical ingredients shouldn’t be a guessing game.

    We understand a single missed container can halt batching and blow margins.
    Our team built an AI tuned to spices by origin and grade, continuously
    ingesting commodity, FX, freight, customs, weather, and supplier-risk
    signals to deliver clear, actionable insights.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ERP, vendor list, contracts, lanes, specs.

    2) Configure: Watchlists (pepper, vanilla, chili, turmeric, etc.),
    thresholds, FX pairs, and risk appetite.

    3) Act: Get alerts and sourcing suggestions—hedge windows, coverage gaps,
    dual-source candidates, renegotiation triggers.

    Direct: Book a demo or start a 30-day pilot.

    Transitional: Request a sample dashboard and subscribe to the weekly Spice
    Risk Brief.
  success: >-

    resilient multi-sourcing, clean audits, and confident updates to
    leadership—delivered in minutes, not weeks.
  failure: >-
    Keep reacting late: margin erosion, stockouts and line stoppages, emergency
    freight costs, vendor failures, audit findings, and lost customers.
