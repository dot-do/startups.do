leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Student pilots struggle with radio anxiety and non‑standard phraseology;
      CFIs report spending 10–20% of lesson time on comms rather than flight
      tasks.
    - >-
      Limited, structured practice: outside of actual flights or expensive live
      ATC networks, there’s no safe, repeatable way to practice pattern, VFR
      flight following, and IFR clearances with feedback.
    - >-
      Existing tools (videos, flashcards, LiveATC listening) don’t provide
      interactive, voice‑based role‑play or objective scoring against FAA/ICAO
      standards.
    - >-
      High variability in mic technique (PTT timing, over‑modulation, long
      key‑ups) leads to stepped‑on calls and poor readability; students rarely
      receive quantified feedback.
    - >-
      Checkride/proficiency bust risks: incorrect readbacks, missing required
      elements (squawk code, altitude, fix), slow responses, and phrase bloat.
    - >-
      Flight schools need scalable, consistent comms training across instructors
      and campuses; current approaches lack analytics and progress tracking.
    - >-
      International students and accents increase STT error rates;
      general‑purpose speech models do not handle aviation vocabulary well.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI‑driven ATC role‑play covering pattern ops, VFR flight following, and
      IFR clearances (clearance delivery, ground, tower, approach).
    - >-
      Real‑time scoring of phraseology, required elements, brevity, and timing;
      instant corrective coaching and model readbacks to emulate best practices.
    - >-
      Mic technique analyzer that measures PTT timing, clipping,
      over‑modulation, latency to respond, dead air, and background noise; gives
      actionable tips.
    - >-
      Scenario library mapped to ACS/PTS with difficulty levels, local
      procedures, and weather/traffic variables; includes accent and noise
      profiles.
    - >-
      Debrief reports highlighting missed items, standard phrase substitutions,
      and trend analysis; exportable to CFI/instructor dashboards.
    - >-
      Sim and mobile modes: standalone mobile app for commute practice and
      plugin for MSFS/X‑Plane to practice in‑sim with realistic frequencies.
    - >-
      CFI/School admin: assign modules, track completion, view cohort metrics,
      and auto‑generate homework based on student weaknesses.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Make perfect radio calls before you key the mic: an AI ATC that role‑plays
    real procedures and scores your phraseology, readbacks, and mic technique in
    real time—aligned to FAA/ICAO standards and ACS tasks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Aviation‑specific, labeled phraseology/readback dataset and mic‑technique
    telemetry captured at scale, enabling a real‑time scoring engine with low
    latency and high accuracy that generalist ASR/LLMs can’t match; embedded in
    sim ecosystems and ACS‑mapped curricula with CFI/ATC‑validated rubrics and
    WINGS‑eligible modules.
