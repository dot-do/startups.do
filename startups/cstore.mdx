leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic stockouts on high-velocity SKUs (energy drinks, RTD coffee,
      tobacco, salty snacks, packaged bakery) causing lost sales; managers lack
      tools to forecast demand by SKU/store/day.
    - >-
      Over-ordering and slow inventory turns lead to cash tied up in backrooms,
      expired/markdown product, and shrink; limited shelf capacity intensifies
      the problem.
    - >-
      Manual ordering is time-consuming (2–4 hours/week/store) and error-prone;
      vendor-rep “suggested orders” can be biased and fragmented across
      suppliers.
    - >-
      Demand is volatile and local (weather, events, construction, school
      calendars) but most stores order by rules of thumb; promotions spike
      demand unpredictably.
    - >-
      Complex vendor constraints (case packs, minimums, delivery days, DSD vs.
      warehouse, tobacco/age-restricted compliance) make optimal ordering hard.
    - >-
      Poor data hygiene (item masters, UPC duplicates, missing case-pack info)
      and limited analytics in older POS/back-office systems hinder decision
      quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest POS sales, inventory and vendor delivery calendars to forecast
      demand per SKU/store/day; translate to suggested order quantities by
      vendor with case-pack rounding and minimums.
    - >-
      Generate vendor-ready order drafts (EDI 850/XML/portal CSV/email) aligned
      to each supplier’s format and delivery day; managers approve or adjust
      exceptions.
    - >-
      Incorporate weather, holidays, local events, school calendars, and
      promotions to adjust demand curves automatically.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow: highlight outs, odd variances, new/discontinued
      items, and capacity conflicts; automate the rest.
    - >-
      Continuous learning models per category/SKU accounting for seasonality,
      trends, cannibalization, and promo lift; cold-start baselines for new
      items using look-alike SKUs.
    - >-
      Data hygiene utilities to normalize UPCs, map case packs, and de-duplicate
      catalog entries; feedback loop to POS/back-office item master.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce outs and overstock with vendor-ready, AI-generated order drafts that
    managers approve in minutes. Purpose-built for c-stores at gas stations:
    SKU/store/day forecasts that account for DSD/warehouse constraints, case
    packs, delivery calendars, weather/events, and promotions—improving on-shelf
    availability and cash flow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built c-store demand models plus a growing network of POS and
    distributor integrations that encode delivery calendars, case packs, and DSD
    realities—creating a data/integration moat. As more stores/vendors connect,
    forecasts and auto-order accuracy improve, accelerating adoption and making
    replication difficult.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Independent and small-chain gas stations with C-stores (1–50 stores) using
      common POS/back-office (PDI, Petrosoft, CStorePro, NCR,

    - >-
      Regional operators (50–500 stores) seeking centralized ordering governance
      with store-level exceptions and vendor-ready POs.
    - >-

      heavy) needing perishable-sensitive demand predictions.
  channels:
    - >-

      ROI-led demos using store’s last 8–12 weeks of data.
