  problem:
    - >-
      Courier and local delivery companies lose bookings after-hours and during
      peak call times because no one answers fast enough; 25–45% of inbound
      calls go to voicemail or get abandoned.
    - >-
      Manual quoting is slow and inconsistent; average time-to-quote by
      phone/email is 3–8 minutes, with frequent errors in distance, zones,
      surcharges, and vehicle selection.
    - >-
      High labor cost and burnout for dispatchers handling repetitive intake
      tasks (addresses, timing, vehicle, price questions) that could be
      automated.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly expect instant, self-serve experiences via SMS/web;
      many couriers lack modern web or messaging intake.
    - >-
      Payments are often collected at delivery or invoiced later, increasing
      failed collections and DSO.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stacks (TMS + telephony + payments) hinder seamless
      intake-to-job creation, causing double-entry and data errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational intake across Web Chat, SMS, WhatsApp, and Phone/IVR that
      collects pickup/drop-off, timing, vehicle, package details, and special
      instructions.
    - >-
      Instant pricing engine using distance, zones, time windows, service
      levels, weight/size, fuel and after-hours surcharges, and
      customer-specific rate cards.
    - >-
      Embedded payment (card/wallet/ACH) with optional preauth or full capture
      before dispatch; PCI-compliant and supports saved payment methods.
    - >-
      One-click job creation in leading courier TMS platforms (e.g., Onfleet,
      OnTime 360, Digital Waybill, Xcelerator, Shipday, Tookan) including
      proof-of-delivery fields.
    - >-
      Address validation, geocoding, and ETA checks; detects multi-stop and
      route jobs; flags restricted locations (hospitals, labs, campuses).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop failover: escalate to a dispatcher when confidence is
      low, edge cases arise, or VIP customers call.
    - >-
      Analytics and coaching: quote-to-book conversion, call deflection rate,
      time-to-quote, after-hours bookings, and job profitability alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Answer every call/text/chat 24/7, deliver an accurate quote in under 15
    seconds, take payment, and create the job in your TMS—without a human
    dispatcher.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Courier-specific quote engine and TMS integration library that imports messy
    legacy rate cards in hours, not weeks—plus domain-tuned conversation flows
    that consistently reach >98% pricing accuracy and >60% call deflection
    within 60 days.
