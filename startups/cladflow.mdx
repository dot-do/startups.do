    purchase orders with delivery scheduling.
  targetUsers:
    - Project Manager
    - Purchasing
    - Owner
  triggers:
    - Proposal accepted
    - Production ready
    - Change order approved
  inputs:
    - Finalized BOM by SKU or category
    - Supplier price catalogs and pack sizes
    - Preferred brands/colors
    - Delivery address/time windows
    - Credit terms and PO format
  steps:

    - >-
      Optimize for pack sizes/min order quantities; propose substitutions if
      allowed
    - Check live availability/pricing (where supported)
    - Create POs by supplier and delivery phase
    - Route for approval; send to supplier via EDI/email
    - Track confirmations and delivery dates; update schedule
  tools:
    - 'Supplier portals/APIs (ABC Supply, Beacon)'
    - EDI/email automation
    - Google Sheets/Excel
    - QuickBooks Online
    - OptaPlanner/linear optimization (optional)
  outputs:

  pricingModel:
    - Per-job
    - Savings share + base fee
    - Monthly (for purchasing volume)

  problem:
    - >-
      Contractors overbuy or underbuy because estimates aren’t optimized to
      supplier pack/carton sizes, causing 5–12% material waste and 2–6%
      return/restock fees per job.
    - >-
      Availability is unknown at order time; substitutions and color/texture
      mismatches lead to delays or rework, idling crews 0.5–2.0 hours/job.
    - >-
      PO creation is manual (spreadsheets, calls, portals), consuming 45–90
      minutes per PO and producing SKU/color errors in 3–7% of orders.
    - >-
      Delivery timing isn’t coordinated with crew schedules and site readiness;
      missed drops and partial fills increase cycle time 1–3 days on multi-day
      jobs.
    - >-
      No closed loop between estimate BOM and actual usage; margin leakage (1–3
      pts) isn’t visible until job closeout.
    - >-
      Multi-supplier purchasing is fragmented; each portal has unique SKUs, pack
      rules, and pricing, complicating standardization and reconciliation.
    - >-
      Change orders mid-job are poorly managed; add-ons and returns aren’t
      synchronized, causing overstock, lost credits, and AP reconciliation
      friction.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI BOM optimizer maps takeoffs to supplier-specific SKUs and
      pack/carton/trim lengths to minimize waste while respecting
      color/texture/accessory compatibility and cut patterns.
    - >-
      Real-time inventory/lead-time check across preferred suppliers; offers
      cost/availability scenarios and smart substitutions that preserve visual
      spec (e.g., color LRV match, profile).
    - >-
      One-click, error-checked PO creation via EDI/API/portal automation with
      line-level validations (uom, pack rounding, color codes, accessory
      completeness).
    - >-
      Delivery scheduling assistant that books slots, splits shipments by
      phase/area, includes site drop notes and lift requirements; dynamic
      updates on ETA and fill rate.
    - >-
      Change-order and return workflows that reconcile to job budgets; automated
      credit tracking and AP-ready PO/return docs.
    - >-
      Usage feedback loop: mobile field adjustments and delivery variances feed
      back into estimator- and crew-specific waste factors.
    - >-
      Integrations to estimating, CRM/PM, and accounting to sync jobs, budgets,
      vendors, and actuals; analytics surface margin leakage and supplier
      performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce siding material waste and procurement admin by automating pack-size
    optimization, real-time availability checks, and ePOs with scheduled
    delivery—cutting waste 7–12%, PO time 60–80%, and improving on-time
    deliveries 15–25%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary siding-specific optimization engine and SKU/pack rules dataset
    co-developed with top distributors and OEMs, plus live availability pipes.
    This yields superior waste reduction and fewer errors than generic
    procurement tools, and improves with each job via feedback loops per crew
    and product line.

  character: >-
    Siding contractors, project managers, and estimators who want to order
    exactly what the crew needs—on time, with minimal waste and admin.
  problem: >-
    External: BOMs rarely match supplier pack sizes; stock changes daily; manual
    PO work causes errors and delays. Internal: tired of guesswork, returns,
    rush fees, and crews waiting. Philosophical: buying materials shouldn’t be a
    gamble—suppliers should fit your plan, not the other way around.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pain of overages, backorders, and missed deliveries that
    stall installs. Our team blends construction ops and AI, with a track record
    of reducing material waste and speeding up PO cycles, backed by clear audit
    trails and supplier-ready outputs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Upload BOMs and link supplier catalogs. 2) Configure: Set pack
    rules, substitutions, approvals, and delivery windows. 3) Automate: Get
    optimized orders, approve in one click, and we issue POs and schedule
    deliveries with live status.

    Transitional: Download the optimization checklist and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    BOMs optimized to pack sizes, fewer trips and returns, zero stockout days,
    faster PO turnaround, deliveries sequenced to the install plan, happier
    crews, on-time projects, and stronger margins with predictable cash flow.
  failure: >-
    Keep overbuying, chasing backorders, paying rush fees, losing days on site,
    frustrating crews, and watching margins erode due to waste and delays.
