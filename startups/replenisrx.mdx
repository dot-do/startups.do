  problem:
    - >-
      Pharmacies face 3–8% revenue loss from stockouts of top movers and patient
      churn when prescriptions can’t be filled same-day.
    - >-
      Manual ordering consumes 3–6 hours/week per store and relies on static
      min/max rules that don’t adapt to seasonality, price volatility, or lead
      time variability.
    - >-
      Excess inventory ties up $25k–$80k per store in working capital; expired
      and dead stock typically account for 1.5–3.0% of on-hand dollars annually.
    - >-
      Backorders force time-consuming calls and guesswork; substitutions are not
      systematically optimized for AB-rated equivalents, payer MAC lists, or
      acquisition cost.
    - >-
      Existing tools in PMS/wholesaler portals provide basic reorder suggestions
      but lack SKU-level demand forecasting for intermittent items (slow movers)
      and multi-wholesaler optimization.
    - >-
      Compliance complexities (controlled substances thresholds, DSCSA, audit
      trails) deter more aggressive automation.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-level demand forecasting by NDC and roll-up by GCN using a hybrid of
      intermittent-demand models (Croston/TSB) and seasonal models,
      incorporating day-of-week patterns, local epidemiology (e.g., CDC ILI),
      promotions, and prescriber behavior.
    - >-
      Dynamic reorder point and safety stock optimization with target service
      levels by ABC class (e.g., A items 98–99%, B 96–97%, C 92–95%) and
      lead-time variability by wholesaler.
    - >-
      Automated order preparation: generate reviewable purchase orders by
      wholesaler with pack-size awareness, MOQs, contract cost, rebates, and
      controlled-substance thresholds; transmit via EDI 850/API.
    - >-
      Intelligent substitution engine for backorders: suggests AB-rated
      therapeutically equivalent NDCs, alternative strengths/forms when
      clinically appropriate, and cross-wholesaler availability; considers payer
      MAC lists and patient co-pay sensitivity.
    - >-
      Price and rebate optimization: detect cost changes, primary vs. secondary
      wholesaler arbitrage, and timing of buy-downs where contractually
      permitted.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: audit trails, role-based approvals, suspicious order
      monitoring for controlled substances, and DSCSA documentation links for
      traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Boost service levels and free cash with pharmacy-specific AI that forecasts
    by NDC/GCN, optimizes reorder points for targeted service levels,
    auto-prepares wholesaler orders, and proposes clinically and payer-aligned
    substitutions during backorders—reducing stockouts 30–50%, on-hand inventory
    12–18%, and expired stock 25–40%, while saving 3–6 hours/week per store.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization trained on cross-store, SKU-level pharmacy demand
    and lead-time patterns; breadth of PMS/wholesaler integrations;
    clinically-aware substitution engine aligned to Orange Book and payer
    economics; and trusted distribution via PSAO/wholesaler partnerships. Over
    time, network effects improve forecasts and substitution success by
    geography and seasonality.

      (10–100 locations) in the U.S.
