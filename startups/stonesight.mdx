  problem:
    - >-
      Manual QC at factories and install sites is inconsistent and relies on
      individual skill; 2–8% of jobs experience defects that escape to the next
      step or to the customer.
    - >-
      Install callbacks (seam gaps, chips, misaligned cutouts, lippage) cost
      $250–$1,200 per incident and add 1–3 weeks of cycle time for
      rework/replacement.
    - >-
      No standardized photo evidence leads to disputes with GCs/homeowners and
      limited leverage with carriers for transit damage claims.
    - >-
      Tolerances vary by customer (e.g., big-box vs. custom builder) and are
      hard to enforce operationally at scale.
    - >-
      Training new QC techs/installers takes months; lack of guided standards
      slows ramp-up and causes variation.
    - >-
      QC records are siloed from ERP/MES/CAD data, making audits, warranty
      claims, and continuous improvement difficult.
    - >-
      Factory-to-field feedback loop is slow; root causes (tool wear, polish
      quality, templating variance) are not identified quickly enough.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app (iOS/Android) that guides technicians through standardized
      photo capture using AR overlays and a printed calibration mat/fiducial
      card.
    - >-
      On-device and cloud AI models to detect and measure: chips ≥1 mm, seam
      gaps to ±0.5 mm, lippage to ±0.5 mm, polish uniformity (specular/gloss
      proxy), cutout placement vs. CAD/DXF, edge profile conformity, surface
      damage (scratches/cracks).
    - >-
      Configurable tolerance libraries by customer/job type (e.g., big-box: seam
      gap ≤1.5 mm, lippage ≤0.5 mm; custom builder: seam gap ≤1.0 mm).
    - >-
      Factory workflow: pre-pack QC and post-pack damage check with annotated
      pass/fail and required rework codes (e.g., repolish, recut, edge
      touch-up).
    - >-
      Install workflow: pre-seam and post-seam checks, levelness and overhang
      verification, sink/cooktop cutout alignment, final homeowner/GC e-sign
      with photo report.
    - >-
      Integrations: pull job specs from ERP (e.g., Moraware/ActionFlow), CAD/DXF
      from templating systems (LT-2D3D, Prodim), and push QC outcomes to MES/ERP
      for traceability.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review for borderline cases; supervisors can override
      with reasons to build training data and improve models.
    - >-
      Quality analytics dashboard: first-pass yield, defect pareto (chip, seam,
      polish), station/crew performance, and trend alerts (e.g., polish head
      wear indicated by rising haze defects).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce rework and callbacks by 30–60% with guided photo capture and AI
    checks tailored to stone manufacturing and installation. Instant pass/fail
    with millimeter-level measurements, standardized documentation, and
    integrations to your CAD/ERP—without fixed cameras or expensive hardware.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of real factory and install defects tied to
    job metadata and outcomes; tolerance libraries codified for major retailer
    programs; and a calibration approach enabling mm-level measurement with
    commodity phones—embedded via integrations into the stone industry’s
    most-used ERP/templating tools.

  character: >-
    Stone fabricators, shop managers, QC leads, and installers (NAICS 327991)
    who must deliver flawless parts and installs on time.
  problem: >-
    Defects slip through—chips, seam gaps, poor polish, misaligned cutouts,
    transit/install damage—causing remakes, callbacks, chargebacks, and
    disputes, with scattered photos and inconsistent QC across shifts and crews.
  guide: >-
    We understand stone workflows. Built with fabricators and installers, our
    image-based QC assistant uses guided photo capture and AI to flag chips,
    seam gaps, polish issues, cutout placement, and damage, standardizing checks
    and documenting every step with time‑stamped evidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Configure shop and field checklists. 2) Capture guided photos at each
    station/step; AI highlights issues instantly. 3) Fix, recapture, and
    auto-generate a QC report that travels with the job.
  callToAction: Book a demo and start a pilot with one line or install crew.
  success: >-
    Consistent QC from factory to install; fewer remakes and callbacks; faster
    approvals; clear photo proof for customers and GCs; easier training;
    accountability; stronger margins and schedules.
  failure: >-
    Avoid missed defects, finger‑pointing, costly remakes, schedule slips,
    chargebacks, and reputation damage.
