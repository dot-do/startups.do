leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone traceability processes: 6–12 weeks and 400–800
      engineering hours per major review (SRR/PDR/CDR/TRR) to produce RTMs,
      VCRMs, and compliance matrices from RFP/specs to system requirements and
      test artifacts.
    - >-
      Requirements volatility and change impact: 20–30% of trace links become
      stale after each spec revision or ECP, causing rework and schedule risk.
    - >-
      Audit exposure: frequent DCMA/customer findings for missing bidirectional
      trace, incomplete verification methods, and mismatched standards
      references; corrective actions cost $50k–$250k per finding.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain (DOORS/Polarion/Jama + PLM + Jira + test tools) with
      no unified, standards-aware traceability view; information spread across
      siloed systems and spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Security constraints: CUI/ITAR data cannot use public AI; need
      IL4/IL5-capable GovCloud or on-prem/air-gapped deployments with US
      Persons-only support and complete audit trails.
    - >-
      Knowledge continuity risk: tribal knowledge of MIL-STD/STANAG mappings
      sits with a few senior engineers near retirement; onboarding new engineers
      takes months.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-source ingestion and normalization: parse RFPs/specs (PDF/Word),
      MIL-STDs/STANAGs, DOORS NG/Jama/Polarion projects, SysML (Cameo),
      Jira/Azure DevOps, and test repositories (TestRail/NI/VectorCAST) into a
      defense requirements knowledge graph.
    - >-
      Standards-aware AI linking: fine-tuned models suggest bidirectional links
      (source→system→subsystem→test→verification method) with human-in-the-loop
      review; targets precision ≥0.90 / recall ≥0.95 after program tuning.
    - >-
      Automated compliance matrix and VCRM builder: export to Excel/CSV,
      DOORS/Jama formats, and CDRL/DID-ready packages including assumptions,
      rationale, and evidence pointers.
    - >-
      Continuous gap and coverage analysis: dashboards for coverage (% linked to
      source and verification), MIL-STD method completeness, and readiness for
      SRR/PDR/CDR/TRR; prescriptive recommendations to close gaps.
    - >-
      Change-impact engine: detect spec/RFP deltas, surface affected
      requirements/tests, and propose link updates within 24 hours; notify
      owners and route approvals.
    - >-
      Security and governance: RBAC with CUI/ITAR tags, SSO (CAC/PIV/SAML),
      immutable audit logs, data residency in GovCloud or air-gapped
      deployments; US Persons-only support and optional on-site ops.
    - >-
      Program lexicon/ontology packs: configurable mapping for common
      land-systems standards (MIL-STD-810/461/882, STANAG 4569, ISO/IEC/IEEE
      15288/29148) and customer-specific DID/CDRL templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Secure, defense-grade AI agent that auto-builds end-to-end traceability from
    RFP/specs through system/subsystem requirements to test/verification,
    generates audit-ready compliance matrices, and runs continuous gap +
    change-impact analysis. Deployable in AWS GovCloud (IL4/IL5 patterns) or
    air-gapped on-prem, integrated with DOORS/Jama/Polarion/PLM. Cuts matrix
    prep time by 70–90%, improves link coverage to >98%, and reduces audit
    findings by ~50% within two audit cycles.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, standards-aware knowledge graph and AI models mapped to
    MIL-STD/STANAG requirements and verification methods, combined with
    certified connectors and defense-grade deployment (GovCloud IL4/IL5 patterns
    and air-gapped). US Persons-only support operations, audit-evidence
    automation accepted by early design partners, and go-to-market alliances
    with major RM/ALM vendors create high switching costs and credibility in
    classified/CUI environments.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Defense OEMs and Tier-1/Tier-2 suppliers building armored vehicles, tanks,
    and components—program managers, chief engineers, and compliance leads who
    must prove every requirement is traced from RFP/specs to verification.
  problem: >-
    External: Requirements, tests, and verification artifacts live in silos;
    compliance matrices are manual, brittle, and break under change. Internal:
    Teams are drowning in version churn, uncertainty, and audit pressure.
    Philosophical: Mission-critical platforms shouldn’t be slowed by paperwork
    or risk hidden in untraced requirements.
  guide: >-
    We understand defense acquisition complexity and MIL-STD-driven
    verification. Our AI agent and secure workflow provide evidence-based trace
    links, audit trails, and deployments aligned to ITAR/CMMC
    practices—on-prem/air-gapped or secure cloud—so you can trust every line of
    the matrix.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest: RFP/specs, SOW, ICDs, system requirements, tests, and results. 2)
    Trace: Auto-map end-to-end links with rationale, versioning, and gap flags.
    3) Prove: Export audit-ready compliance matrices, gap analyses, and
    change-impact reports. 4) Integrate and scale: Connect to DOORS/Jama and
    PLM/ALM; start with a 2-week pilot, then roll out program-wide.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute demo using your current RFP/specs. Transitional:
    Request the security white paper and a sample compliance matrix.
  success: >-
    End-to-end traceability from day one; faster, higher-confidence bids; fewer
    defects and rework; clean audits; continuous compliance as requirements and
    tests evolve; measurable schedule and risk reduction.
  failure: >-
    Without it: missed or conflicting requirements, late verification surprises,
    audit findings, costly redesign and schedule slips, protest/penalty
    exposure, and lost bids to better-prepared competitors.
