leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Low first-time-fix rates (typical 60–75%) lead to repeat callbacks of
      10–20%, driving avoidable truck rolls and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis (RCA) is slow and inconsistent because logs
      (controller, drive, door operator), technician notes, and ad-hoc phone
      videos are siloed; average RCA time can exceed 60–120 minutes per
      incident.
    - >-
      Retiring experts and high turnover cause knowledge loss; new technicians
      need 6–18 months to reach proficiency across diverse OEM models and
      generations.
    - >-
      Fault codes are inconsistent across OEMs/models; symptom → cause mappings
      are ambiguous without context, leading to misdiagnosis.
    - >-
      Compliance and safety documentation (e.g., 8D/A3, ASME/EN incident
      reporting) is manual and time-consuming, adding 20–60 minutes per
      significant incident.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime penalties (SLAs) and warranty costs erode margin; each
      truck roll costs $200–$600, and site downtime harms building tenants and
      brand reputation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a secure, multimodal RCA assistant that ingests controller/PLC
      logs, drive/door operator events, technician notes, photos/videos, and
      sensor streams to produce ranked likely causes with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Propose precise, tool-ready confirmatory tests (e.g., multimeter steps,
      encoder verification, door zone sensor alignment checks) and decision
      trees tailored to the asset model and environment.
    - >-
      Package RCA outputs into 8D/A3 corrective actions and incident reports;
      auto-fill regulatory sections (ASME A17.1/CSA B44, EN 81) and customer
      SLAs.
    - >-
      Provide connectors and APIs to CMMS/ERP (Maximo, SAP PM), remote
      monitoring platforms, and OEM data exports; support offline mobile usage
      with later sync.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from technician-confirmed outcomes and fleet-wide
      patterns; improve mappings across OEMs/models and environment contexts
      (temperature, traffic).
    - >-
      Offer enterprise controls: PHI/PII redaction, role-based access, SOC 2/ISO
      27001-ready security, on-prem/VPC deployment for sensitive customers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    LLM-assisted, multimodal RCA that cuts time-to-root-cause by up to 50%,
    lifts first-time-fix by 10–20 percentage points, and reduces repeat
    callbacks by 25–35%, by unifying logs, technician notes, and videos into
    actionable likely-cause rankings and step-by-step confirmatory
    tests—complete with auto-generated compliance-ready reports.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, cross-OEM fault ontology enriched by
    technician-verified confirmatory tests and outcomes, plus a growing
    proprietary corpus of annotated logs and videos. Combined with
    safety-reviewed playbooks, offline-first mobile workflows, and deep CMMS/IoT
    integrations, this data and process moat is hard to replicate by generic AI
    or single-OEM tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality, reliability, and field service leaders at elevator and moving
    stairway OEMs/maintainers who need rapid, defensible RCAs without pulling
    experts off urgent work.
  problem: >-
    External: Incidents produce scattered logs, videos, sensor traces, and
    technician notes; downtime grows and repeat callbacks persist.

    Internal: Teams are stretched, knowledge is tribal, audits loom, and
    confidence in the "why" is fragile.

    Philosophical: Passenger safety and uptime shouldn’t depend on who’s on
    shift or how fast someone can sift evidence.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of SLAs, safety scrutiny, and public
    visibility when vertical transportation stalls.

    Authority: Built by reliability engineers and applied-AI practitioners, our
    service reads logs, video, and notes to surface likely causes with cited
    evidence and recommended confirmatory tests—keeping humans in the loop.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect data sources or upload a case bundle (logs, clips, notes).

    2) AI triage delivers ranked likely causes with confidence, evidence links,
    and confirmatory test steps (e.g., door torque/obstruction, drive fault
    pattern, brake lift/slip, encoder alignment, step-chain tension, handrail
    speed sync, governor checks).

    3) Validate results, capture findings, and export an audit-ready RCA that
    syncs to your CMMS/ERP.

    Agreement plan:

    - Enterprise-grade security; your data stays private; opt-in only for model
    improvements.

    - Human approval before sharing or closing RCAs.

    - Low-risk pilot with clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo. Start a 2‑week pilot on recent incidents.

    Transitional: Download a sample RCA report. Get the confirmatory test
    checklist for doors, drives, brakes, encoders, and escalators.
  success: >-
    Faster time-to-root-cause, higher first-time fix rate, fewer repeat
    callbacks, shorter downtime, stronger safety posture, audit-ready
    documentation, captured institutional knowledge, better supplier quality
    feedback, and fleet-wide pattern detection.
  failure: >-
    Without this: longer outages, recurring faults, inconclusive RCAs, missed
    safety signals, regulatory and customer escalations, technician burnout, SLA
    penalties, and brand erosion.

    - >-
      Scattered evidence—controller logs, drive faults, videos, and handwritten
      notes—slows RCA.
    - Senior experts are bottlenecks; tribal knowledge isn’t captured or reused.
    - >-
      Inconsistent RCA quality leads to repeat failures and rising warranty
      cost.
