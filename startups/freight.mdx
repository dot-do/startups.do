leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Carrier bids arrive in inconsistent formats and lane definitions, forcing
      2–6 weeks of manual normalization before analysis can start
    - >-
      Complex constraints (incumbency, carrier caps, modal mixes, service SLAs,
      minimum award sizes) are hard to model in spreadsheets, leading to
      suboptimal or non-compliant awards
    - >-
      Procurement teams lack rapid what-if scenario analysis, slowing decisions
      and reducing negotiating leverage
    - >-
      Fragmented data (historical rates, volumes, accessorials, service KPIs,
      emissions) prevents holistic cost-service optimization
    - >-
      Limited auditability and governance make it hard to justify awards to
      finance and comply with internal controls
    - >-
      Market volatility (fuel, capacity swings) makes static awards risky; teams
      lack tools to quantify resilience and risk-adjusted outcomes
    - >-
      RFP cycles take 8–12 weeks and cost hundreds of hours, delaying savings
      and tying up stakeholders
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of carrier bids from Excel, portals, and EDI/API;
      normalize to a canonical lane schema with AI-assisted mapping
    - >-
      Constraint modeling library (incumbency, carrier share caps,
      multi-sourcing, min/max awards, lead-time SLAs, equipment, hazmat,
      dedicated vs spot mix) with visual builder
    - >-
      Optimization engine (MIP + heuristics) to produce cost-, service-, and
      risk-balanced award scenarios with explainable trade-offs
    - >-
      Scenario management to compare baseline, aggressive savings, service-max,
      carbon-min, and resilience-focused awards
    - >-
      Carrier scorecards combining historical performance KPIs, sustainability
      metrics, and risk signals
    - >-
      Workflow, approvals, and audit trail for sourcing governance; one-click
      export of awards to TMS/ERP and carrier notifications
    - >-
      Benchmarking and anomaly detection to flag outlier rates, missing
      accessorials, and unrealistic commitments
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut freight RFP cycle time by 50% and deliver 3–8% net savings while
    preserving service KPIs through AI-driven bid normalization,
    constraint-aware optimization, and auditable award scenarios integrated to
    your TMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary normalization ontology and constraint library tuned on
    thousands of historical bid patterns, combined with explainable
    multi-objective optimization and prebuilt TMS integrations, allows same-day
    normalization and scenarioing with audited decisions—hard for generalist
    sourcing tools to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Logistics and procurement leaders at shippers who must award freight lanes
    that balance cost, service, and constraints.
  problem: >-
    External: messy, incomparable bids and complex constraints. Internal: teams
    drowning in spreadsheets and time pressure. Philosophical: you shouldn’t
    have to gamble service and cost on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand RFP chaos and carrier negotiations. Our AI normalizes bids,
    models your real-world constraints, and surfaces clear, defensible award
    scenarios.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload bids, business rules, and constraints; 2) Review AI-optimized
    scenarios for cost/service tradeoffs; 3) Finalize lane awards and export to
    TMS/contracts.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a pilot on your next RFP.
  success: >-
    Confident, audit-ready awards that reduce spend, protect service levels,
    accelerate cycles, and strengthen carrier partnerships.
  failure: >-
    Overpaying for freight, missed SLAs, carrier churn, and endless spreadsheet
    firefighting with low confidence in the outcome.

  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent bids (accessorials, fuel, exceptions) make apples-to-oranges
      comparisons.
    - Spreadsheets break at scale across thousands of lanes and scenarios.
    - >-
      Business rules (incumbency, allocations, min/max splits) are hard to
      enforce.
    - Decisions stall without fast what‑if modeling and transparent trade‑offs.
    - Over‑concentration and service risk go unnoticed until disruptions hit.
    - Stakeholders lack a clear audit trail for why awards were made.
  solution:
    - 'Normalize all carrier submissions into a single, comparable schema.'
    - Model your constraints and policies with a no‑code rules engine.
    - 'Optimize awards with a solver that balances cost, service, and risk.'
    - 'Run instant scenarios to test incumbency, allocations, and mode shifts.'
    - 'Publish clear, auditable award rationales and ready‑to‑send packets.'
    - Integrate with TMS/ERP to activate awards and monitor performance.
