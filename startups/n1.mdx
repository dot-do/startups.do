leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Transmission operators and planners must screen thousands to tens of
      thousands of N-1 contingencies per study snapshot; traditional tools are
      slow, require manual filtering, and often rely on DC screening with
      limited AC validation.
    - >-
      Operator time is wasted on low-impact contingencies; high-impact ones may
      be buried in reports without clear, costed remedial actions.
    - >-
      Existing EMS/Planning modules flag violations but don’t efficiently
      recommend actionable redispatch/topology changes with cost/risk trade-offs
      and operator-grade explainability.
    - >-
      Congestion costs and curtailments rise because redispatch and topology
      options are not rapidly compared under AC constraints in offline study
      windows.
    - >-
      Integration friction (CIM/CGMES/PSS®E/PSLF format mismatch) and
      cybersecurity constraints make trying new analytics risky and costly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fast DC-based pre-screening using PTDF/LODF/OTDF to evaluate 5,000–50,000
      contingencies within minutes, followed by prioritized AC power flow
      validation.
    - >-
      Actionable remedial actions: (a) security-constrained redispatch with cost
      curves and ramp limits; (b) topology optimization (line switching,
      phase-shifter taps, transformer taps) under operational constraints.
    - >-
      AI-assisted ranking: learn from historical operator approvals and system
      responses to surface the most viable actions first, with clear
      explanations (sensitivities, binding constraints).
    - >-
      Full auditability: reproducible runs, versioned snapshots, and change logs
      for regulatory traceability (NERC/ENTSO-E expectations).
    - >-
      Seamless model ingest/export: CGMES/CIM/XML, PSS®E RAW/SAV, PSLF,
      PowerFactory, PowerWorld, MATPOWER; results exported to EMS/Outage
      scheduling tools.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: on-prem bare-metal or private cloud, supports
      NERC CIP-aligned controls and offline operation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect, rank, and resolve N-1 violations in minutes per snapshot with
    operator-trustworthy AC validation and costed remedial actions (redispatch +
    topology) that integrate cleanly with your existing EMS/planning
    models—offline and air-gapped if required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, operator-trustworthy AC-backed action engine that combines fast
    PTDF/LODF screening with AI-ranked, costed redispatch/topology
    recommendations, delivered in a CIP-aligned offline deployment. Proprietary
    heuristics for topology feasibility and AC convergence recovery, plus
    pre-built adapters to major EMS/planning tools, shorten procurement and
    integration timelines.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transmission operators, reliability coordinators, and planning engineers who
    need to prove N-1 security on a network snapshot—fast, accurate,
    auditable—while minimizing redispatch cost and operator workload.
  problem: >-
    External: Thousands of N-1 contingencies, time-constrained studies,
    fragmented tools, and costly manual mitigation. Internal: Fear of missing a
    violation and being unable to justify actions to peers, markets, and
    regulators. Philosophical: Keeping the lights on shouldn’t depend on
    guesswork or overnight runs.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the stress of day-ahead analysis, outage coordination,
    and audit prep. Authority: Built by grid-reliability experts; DC screening
    with AC verification; explainable redispatch/topology remedies;
    offline/air-gapped deployment with no data leaving your network; full audit
    trail.
  plan: >-
    1) Import your snapshot (e.g., CGMES/CIM, PSS/E, PowerWorld, MATPOWER). 2)
    Auto-run N-1 DC screen, rank violations, AC-validate top candidates, and
    generate recommended redispatch/topology fixes with rationale. 3) Review,
    approve, and export mitigations to EMS/planning tools with audit-ready
    reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Request a demo and run your first snapshot. Transitional: Download
    the sample report and security one-pager; schedule a 30-minute technical
    assessment.
  success: >-
    Confident N-1 security in minutes, not days; lower congestion/redispatch
    costs; fewer real-time alarms; auditable, explainable decisions; smoother
    outage coordination and market operations; engineers regain focus time.
  failure: >-
    Missed or late N-1 violations leading to load shedding, last-minute
    corrective actions, avoidable congestion costs, regulatory findings, and
    loss of stakeholder trust.
