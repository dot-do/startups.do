  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs and dealer networks routinely miss the model/option mix by region,
      leading to stockouts of fast movers and yard congestion with slow movers
      (dwell >120 days).
    - >-
      Current planning uses top-down sales quotas and spreadsheets;
      SKU/option-level weekly WMAPE is often 35–55% with bias >10%, driving poor
      MPS/MRP signals.
    - >-
      Long and variable component lead times (4–20 weeks) and model-year
      changeovers cause bullwhip effects and costly expedites.
    - >-
      Dealer allocations are reactive, not predictive; promotions, seasonality,
      and regional preferences (e.g., bunkhouse vs couples, cold-weather
      packages) aren’t quantified.
    - >-
      NPI/new model-year forecasting lacks attribute-based analogs, causing
      under- or over-build for new trims/options.
    - >-
      Disconnect between sales forecasts and operations; ERP/DRP/MRP aren’t fed
      with dealer/SKU granular demand, limiting capacity planning and supplier
      commitments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion layer connects to OEM ERP/MRP (e.g., Infor CSI, Epicor
      Kinetic, Dynamics 365), dealer DMS (IDS, Lightspeed), registrations (SSI),
      macro/leading indicators (fuel prices, consumer sentiment, weather).
    - >-
      Hierarchical, attribute-based ML: forecasts at dealer×SKU×option,
      reconciled to brand/region totals; captures seasonality, promotions,
      holidays, fuel price sensitivity, weather, and cannibalization across
      trims.
    - >-
      New product introduction: cold-start via attribute embeddings (length,
      weight, floorplan, price, insulation, appliance set) mapped to historical
      analogs.
    - >-
      Weekly forecast cycles with exception-based review; consensus planning
      workflow for Sales/Dealer overrides with bias tracking and governance.
    - >-
      Allocation optimizer: converts forecasts into dealer allocations with
      service-level targets, capacity and component constraints.
    - >-
      MPS/MRP exports: push netted demand and option-component mix to ERP/MRP
      via API/EDI; simulate supply scenarios (supplier MOQ, lead-time shifts,
      labor constraints).
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if on price, promotions, option-package take
      rates, and lead times; output impacts on OTIF, inventory, and cash.
    - >-
      Accuracy monitoring: live dashboards for WMAPE/MAPE/MASE, bias, coverage,
      acceptance rate; automated model recalibration and drift alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast unit demand by model and option package at dealer/region
    granularity with measurable accuracy (target: top-80% volume SKUs weekly
    WMAPE ≤ 22%, bias within ±5%), enabling OEMs to raise dealer service levels
    to ≥95%, cut finished-goods inventory 15–25%, and reduce expedites 20–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical depth in RV towables with option-level attribute embeddings and
    dealer-level behavioral data, plus integrations with RV-specific DMS and
    registration data. Proven 12-week pilot playbook with guaranteed KPI targets
    and allocation optimizer tied directly to MPS/MRP—difficult for horizontal
    planning tools to replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    RV/travel trailer manufacturers (NAICS 336214) and their dealer networks who
    need SKU/option-level demand clarity by dealer and region to drive MPS/MRP
    and keep the right units on lots.
  problem: >-
    External: Option/package proliferation, seasonality, promotions, and
    fragmented dealer POS data make forecasts unreliable and inventory
    imbalanced. Internal: Ops and sales teams are guessing, MPS/MRP swings,
    expediting rises, and dealers lose confidence. Philosophical: You should
    build what will sell—at the dealer that needs it—without gambling every
    planning cycle.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the 336214 realities—short selling seasons, regional
    preferences, complex option bundles, floorplan limits, and OEM–dealer data
    gaps. Authority: Our AI service ingests dealer POS/wholesale, registrations,
    quotes, and external signals (events, weather, fuel, macro); produces
    explainable SKU/option forecasts with bias tracking; and integrates to your
    ERP/MRP and dealer reporting.
  plan: >-
    1) Data readiness: sign NDA, review the data spec, set a secure feed for
    dealer POS/wholesale and product master. 2) Pilot: select 2–3 regions and
    key models; train/validate; review accuracy, service-level impact, and
    inventory aging. 3) Rollout: automate weekly forecasts, push to MPS/MRP and
    dealer views; monitor accuracy and continuously improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a low-risk pilot. Transitional:
    Request the data checklist and a sample SKU/option forecast report.
  success: >-
    Confident, explainable forecasts by model and option package at
    dealer/region level; higher dealer fill rates and turns; fewer stockouts and
    end-of-season carryover; smoother MPS/MRP with fewer expedites; aligned
    sales–ops decisions; working capital optimized and dealers satisfied.
  failure: >-
    Continued over/under-building, stranded option packages, aging inventory and
    markdowns, dealer friction, reactive expediting, missed sales in peak
    season, and capital tied up where demand never materializes.

  problem:
    - >-
      Allocations based on last year miss shifting local tastes for floorplans
      and option packages.
    - 'Seasonality, RV shows, and regional events whipsaw dealer orders.'
    - 'Price, incentives, fuel costs, and interest rates shift demand mix weekly.'
    - New model years and option refreshes break simple history-based planning.
    - Spreadsheets can’t translate retail signals into MPS/MRP fast enough.
    - Long supplier lead times and complex BOMs make the wrong mix expensive.
    - Aged inventory increases floorplan costs; stockouts lose retail sales.
