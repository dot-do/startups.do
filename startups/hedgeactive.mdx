  problem:
    - >-
      Feedstock price volatility (EO, LAB, fatty alcohols) creates 3–8%
      quarterly COGS swings driven by crude/benzene, ethylene/naphtha, lauric
      oils, FX, and clean-tanker freight; most producers lack a systematic
      hedging and timing framework.
    - >-
      Exposure visibility is fragmented across ERP, procurement, and logistics;
      many teams cannot reconcile plant-level demand, contract terms, and
      delivery routes into a unified hedgeable exposure in time to act.
    - >-
      Existing tools (PRAs dashboards, spreadsheets, generic CTRMs) lack
      plant-gate delivered-cost modeling and do not propose actionable buy/hedge
      windows or contract mixes.
    - >-
      Basis risk is poorly managed: EO/ethylene, LAB/benzene-kerosene, and fatty
      alcohols/lauric oils proxies are imperfect; few teams quantify basis P&L
      or set guardrails.
    - >-
      Freight and FX overlays materially move delivered costs (±1–3% per
      quarter) but are rarely co-optimized with commodity hedges.
    - >-
      Hedge governance is inconsistent: policies exist on paper but are not
      translated into position limits, ladders, alerts, or audit trails; CFOs
      lack clear hedge effectiveness and savings attribution.
    - >-
      Talent and bandwidth constraints: 1–2 analysts juggle data aggregation,
      modeling, and execution across 10–20 inputs, leading to missed market
      windows and manual error.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate and normalize commodity (benzene, ethylene/naphtha, PKO/coconut
      oil), FX, and clean-tanker freight indices with client ERP demand and
      contracts to create a real-time, plant-level exposure map.
    - >-
      Generate explicit buy/hedge windows using regime-aware forecasting and
      percentile bands; output hedge ladders, contract mix (spot vs term vs
      indexed), and recommended tenors.
    - >-
      Optimize basis and proxies (e.g., EO via ethylene/naphtha, LAB via benzene
      + kerosene spread, fatty alcohols via lauric oils/palm complex) with
      quantified basis VaR and guardrails.
    - >-
      Overlay FX and freight hedges; produce delivered-cost-at-plant forecasts
      and confidence intervals with scenario and stress testing.
    - >-
      Provide execution-ready outputs: position limits by month/quarter, hedge
      tickets, and broker/exchange routing via APIs; full audit trail and
      compliance checks.
    - >-
      Backtest vs naive procurement (equal monthly buy) and client historical
      decisions; attribute realized savings and hedge effectiveness by driver
      (commodity, FX, freight, basis).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven feedstock timing and hedge optimization that reduces delivered
    cost 0.5–1.5% and COGS volatility 20–30%, with plant-gate basis modeling,
    actionable buy windows, contract mix recommendations, and automated policy
    compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Plant-gate delivered-cost and basis models purpose-built for surfactants,
    trained on multi-source data and refined with anonymized, privacy-preserving
    cross-client signals; integrated policy-to-execution workflow that turns
    governance into automated hedges; accumulated historical mapping of
    contracts, routes, and proxies that is costly and time-consuming to
    replicate.
