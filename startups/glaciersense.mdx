  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from compressors, evaporators, augers, and conveyors
      causes 5–12% lost production hours during peak season (summer), directly
      reducing bagged ice output and sales.
    - >-
      Reactive maintenance dominates (>60% of tasks), with limited on-site
      skilled technicians on night/weekend shifts; minor vibration or
      temperature anomalies go unnoticed until failure.
    - >-
      Existing SCADA/PLC alarms are threshold-based and produce either too many
      false alarms or miss slow-developing faults (e.g., bearing wear,
      refrigerant leaks, misalignment).
    - >-
      High energy intensity of refrigeration (20–35% of plant OPEX) with little
      visibility into asset-level efficiency losses (e.g., condenser fouling
      increases kWh/ton by 5–15%).
    - >-
      Maintenance logs are siloed and rarely analyzed; lessons learned do not
      translate into predictive rules and do not auto-create work orders in
      CMMS.
    - >-
      Supply-chain constraints on critical spares (e.g., compressor bearings,
      auger gearboxes) create long lead times; plants lack early warning to
      order parts and schedule downtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Install non-invasive sensors (vibration, temperature, current, pressure,
      power meters) on compressors, evaporators, augers, conveyors; ingest
      existing PLC/SCADA tags and maintenance logs.
    - >-
      Asset-specific AI models (compressors, evaporators, augers, conveyors)
      learn normal patterns and detect anomalies; physics-informed features
      (e.g., suction/discharge delta-T, superheat stability, MCSA harmonics)
      increase precision.
    - >-
      Predict remaining useful life (RUL) for critical faults (bearing wear,
      misalignment, refrigerant leaks, belt slip, gearbox wear) with confidence
      intervals to enable scheduled interventions.
    - >-
      Auto-create CMMS work orders (Fiix, UpKeep, Limble, eMaint, Maximo, SAP
      PM) including fault type, severity, recommended tasks, spares, estimated
      labor hours, and latest vibration/thermal snapshots.
    - >-
      Energy optimization: benchmark kWh/ton ice, detect efficiency drifts
      (e.g., condenser fouling, evaporator icing) and recommend cleaning or
      setpoint tweaks.
    - >-
      Operator guidance with simple pass/fail checklists and escalation paths;
      mobile alerts with audio/spectrogram attachments and QR-code asset lookup
      for on-floor verification.
    - >-
      Cloud dashboards and plant TV boards show asset health scores, top risks
      by line, WO status, and avoided downtime dollars; API for data export to
      BI.

    Plant managers and maintenance supervisors at ice manufacturing facilities
    who need predictable uptime, safe operations, and clear maintenance
    priorities.
  problem: >-
    External — Compressors, evaporators, augers, and conveyors fail
    unexpectedly, causing scrap and missed deliveries. Internal — You’re tired
    of firefighting, blind spots in equipment health, and reactive maintenance.
    Philosophical — Avoidable failures shouldn’t derail production or your
    team’s day.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of a line going down mid-run. Our team blends
    refrigeration engineering with industrial AI and CMMS expertise to turn
    sensor signals and maintenance logs into timely, actionable work.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sensors and maintenance logs; integrate with CMMS/SCADA. 2) The
    model learns normal behavior and flags early anomalies by asset and failure
    mode. 3) Auto-create prioritized CMMS work orders with recommended checks
    and parts. 4) Review outcomes monthly to refine thresholds and playbooks.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute assessment to scope data and ROI, then run a 30-day pilot
    on one line to validate alerts and workflow fit.
  success: >-
    Steady, predictable production; fewer unplanned stops; earlier detection of
    compressor, evaporator, auger, and conveyor issues; extended asset life;
    better labor planning; safer, compliant operations; data-backed maintenance
    priorities that your team trusts.
  failure: >-
    Without predictive maintenance, expect surprise breakdowns, product loss
    from temperature excursions, overtime repairs, missed loads, and
    safety/compliance risk.
