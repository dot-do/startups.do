  problem:
    - >-
      Heat stress regularly reduces milk yield (3–15% per heat event) and
      average daily gain (ADG) (0.05–0.2 kg/day) in dual‑purpose herds, eroding
      margins.
    - >-
      Producers lack hyperlocal, actionable early warnings that translate
      temperature‑humidity index (THI) into herd‑specific losses and
      step‑by‑step mitigation actions.
    - >-
      Water and shade checks are inconsistent; trough flow rates, tank levels,
      and shade coverage are rarely verified before heat events.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either high‑capex sensor platforms or generic weather
      apps; few quantify economic impact or fit low‑connectivity workflows
      (SMS/WhatsApp/USSD).
    - >-
      Labor and cost constraints demand simple, timed playbooks (e.g., shift
      feeding, add electrolytes, reschedule handling) rather than generic
      advice.
    - >-
      Data (weather, sensors, milk weights, weights/ADG) is fragmented; ROI from
      mitigation isn’t tracked, undermining sustained adoption.
    - >-
      Co‑ops/processors and insurers have limited visibility into heat risk,
      losses, and mitigation compliance across their supplier base.
  solution:
    - >-
      3–10 day hyperlocal THI forecasts (1–5 km grid, microclimate downscaling),
      daily and hourly, with confidence bands and lead‑time indicators.
    - >-
      Herd‑specific risk modeling that translates forecast THI into predicted
      milk loss (L/cow/day) and ADG loss (kg/day), adjusted for breed,
      acclimatization, parity, and historical performance.
    - >-
      Automated, timed mitigation schedules: water flow verification, shade area
      checks, ration adjustments (electrolytes, buffers), work rescheduling,
      sprinkling/fans where available, with pre‑event reminders (48h/24h/6h).
    - >-
      Low‑connectivity delivery and data capture: WhatsApp/SMS/USSD checklists
      with simple Y/N/photo prompts; offline mobile app sync when coverage
      returns.
    - >-
      Water and shade verification loop: calculate required trough flow (L/min)
      and shade m² per head by forecast heat category; prompt fixes and track
      completion rates.
    - >-
      Integrations with common sensors (temp/humidity loggers, water meters, ear
      tags, boluses) and farm software (BoviSync, DairyComp, Afimilk, Stellapps)
      to auto‑calibrate risk and validate outcomes.
    - >-
      Economic impact dashboard: avoided milk loss, preserved ADG,
      mortality/morbidity avoided, ROI of interventions, by event and season.
    - >-
      Team/role workflow: owner, foreman, workers get role‑appropriate tasks and
      reminders; escalation if critical checks fail.
    - >-
      Insurer/co‑op portal for portfolio heat risk, mitigation compliance, and
      bonus/premium credit administration.
    - >-
      Localized playbook libraries by region and resource level (no‑capex,
      low‑capex, high‑capex options), multi‑language support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI early warning that converts hyperlocal THI forecasts into herd‑specific,
    timed mitigation playbooks and verified water/shade checks, predicting milk
    and ADG losses and quantifying avoided loss in dollars per head—delivered
    via WhatsApp/SMS for low‑connectivity operations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, regionally calibrated THI→milk/ADG loss and economics engine
    for dual‑purpose systems, coupled with an offline‑first, checklist‑driven
    mitigation workflow that verifies water/shade readiness. Continuous outcome
    labeling from real farms (actions taken → losses avoided) improves models
    over time and underpins insurer‑backed ROI guarantees.
