leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent, fast-changing speed restrictions (NOAA Right Whale SMAs/DMAs,
      Slow Zones, West Coast VSR advisories, sanctuary zones) are hard to track
      across dispatch, bridge teams, and charterers.
    - >-
      Non-compliance risk is material: civil penalties, lost port incentives,
      insurance/reputation impact; manual monitoring misses alerts and lacks
      defensible evidence.
    - >-
      Slowdowns affect ETAs and bunker consumption; most operators lack tools to
      re-optimize schedules while ensuring a hard 10‑knot cap in active zones.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (AIS, weather/currents, Local Notices to Mariners, zone
      polygons) leads to inconsistent guidance between shoreside ops and the
      bridge.
    - >-
      Current proof-of-compliance is ad hoc (screenshots, emailed notices) and
      not audit-grade for regulators, insurers, or incentive programs.
    - >-
      Great Lakes and West/East Coast programs vary by season and geography;
      fleets need one source of truth that normalizes rules and creates
      actionable orders per voyage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Normalized rule engine that ingests NOAA Right Whale SMAs/DMAs/Slow Zones,
      National Marine Sanctuary advisories, West Coast VSR programs, North
      American ECA boundaries, Great Lakes constraints, and Local Notices to
      Mariners into a single geofence/limit library.
    - >-
      Voyage planning optimizer: creates zone-aware speed plans that hold ≤10
      knots SOG inside active zones and re-allocate speed outside to protect ETA
      and fuel targets; configurable guard-bands (e.g., 9.6–9.8 knots) for
      current and sensor noise.
    - >-
      Real-time monitoring: AIS-driven tracking with predictive alerts at 15–30
      nm before a zone, with escalation via email/SMS/bridge printer/SatC;
      exception handling for safety/weather with documented rationale.
    - >-
      Audit-grade proof logging: tamper-evident, hash-chained records of
      entry/exit timestamps, SOG, zone ID, rule version, vessel
      heading/position, acknowledgements, and exception notes; exportable to
      PDF/JSON and WORM storage.
    - >-
      Compliance scoring and incentives: automated West Coast VSR program
      submissions and scorecards; monthly compliance certificates for
      insurers/charterers.
    - >-
      APIs and bridge overlays: S-57/S-101 layers for ECDIS/ECS; REST/GraphQL
      APIs for TMS/ERP (IMOS, Dataloy, OrbitMI) and weather routing vendors
      (StormGeo, WNI).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Guarantee-ready, regulator-traceable whale-speed and environmental zone
    compliance with minimal schedule disruption. Real-time planning, monitoring,
    and cryptographically signed proof-of-compliance logs that reduce fines,
    unlock incentive payments, and protect schedules and fuel budgets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Regulatory-grade, tamper-evident compliance logs recognized by insurers and
    VSR programs; near-real-time zone activation ingestion and predictive
    alerting tuned to maritime operations; and OEM integrations that place
    guidance directly on ECDIS/bridge displays. Historical dataset of zone
    interactions enables benchmarked, insurer-credible risk scoring.

  character: >-
    US coastal and Great Lakes freight carriers—fleet managers, port captains,
    and voyage planners who must keep vessels on schedule while meeting
    whale‑speed and environmental regulations.
  problem: >-
    External: NOAA Right Whale SMAs/DMAs, seasonal zones, and sanctuaries shift
    frequently; manual tracking is error‑prone. Internal: uncertainty and alert
    fatigue threaten schedules and reputations. Philosophical: moving goods
    shouldn’t harm protected species or require guesswork to stay compliant.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to deliver and comply. Whale‑Speed is your AI
    compliance agent—continuously updating NOAA slow‑zone bulletins and
    protected‑area datasets, ingesting your AIS/routes, and translating rules
    into clear actions with auditable proof‑of‑compliance logs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect AIS and routing; set vessel profiles and policies. 2) Receive
    live overlays, speed advisories, and geofenced alerts for SMAs/DMAs and
    other protected areas across US coasts and the Great Lakes. 3) Auto‑generate
    voyage plans and time‑stamped compliance logs; export for internal audits
    and port state control.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot on one vessel. Transitional: Upload an upcoming
    route for a free compliance check and sample log.
  success: >-
    Confident, on‑time voyages; fewer violations and delays; clean audits with
    verifiable logs; reduced operational risk; crews focused on navigation over
    rule‑chasing; stronger environmental stewardship.
  failure: >-
    Without Whale‑Speed: missed zone updates, accidental incursions, fines and
    detention, insurance scrutiny, reputational damage, and preventable harm to
    protected species.

      protected areas across US Coasts and the Great Lakes. Keep schedules,
      avoid fines, and auto-generate proof-of-compliance logs.

  problem:
    - Shifting slow zones make manual plotting risky and time-consuming.
    - 'Missed advisories lead to fines, schedule hits, and reputational damage.'
    - 'Crews lack clear, timely speed guidance at zone edges.'
    - Proving compliance after the fact is tedious and often incomplete.
    - >-
      Critical data is scattered across NOAA bulletins, USCG LNMs, ECDIS layers,
      and AIS streams.
    - Compliance-driven reroutes disrupt ETAs without decision support.
    - Rules vary by region and season; updates are frequent and easy to miss.
  solution:
    - Turn bulletins and charts into live geofences and speed advisories.
    - >-
      Pre-voyage plans that bake in SMAs/DMAs and protected areas while
      preserving ETAs.
    - >-
      Real-time vessel monitoring with entry/exit detection and proactive
      alerts.
    - >-
      On-the-fly compliant reroutes and speed recommendations to stay on
      schedule.
    - >-
      Auto-generated, tamper-evident logs that stand up to audits and
      enforcement.
    - 'Unified dashboard for fleet policy, zone status, and voyage compliance.'

    - Dynamic speed profiles to meet ETAs without violating caps.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts to bridge, shoreside ops, and dispatch (in-app, email,
      SMS, webhook).
    - ECDIS-compatible overlays (S-57/S-63/ENC) and KML/GeoJSON exports.
    - >-
      Automatic AIS/SAT-AIS ingest; supports GPS, engine, and speed-over-ground
      data.
    - >-
      Compliance log generator: timestamps, positions, speeds, rule references,
      and evidence attachments.
    - Cryptographic signing and hash-chained audit trails to deter tampering.
    - >-
      Rule update engine synced to NOAA bulletins and USCG Local Notices to
      Mariners.
    - 'Role-based access, vessel groups, and policy templates.'

    - 'Data retention controls and one-click export (PDF, CSV, JSON).'
    - >-
      Incident replay and drill-down for enforcement queries and near-miss
      analysis.
    - SLA-backed uptime and enterprise-grade security controls.
  steps:
    - Connect AIS/SAT-AIS feed and import vessels and routes.
    - Choose voyage and ETA; apply fleet policy and zone templates.
    - 'Review AI-generated plan with slow zones, speed caps, and ETA forecasts.'
    - Set alerting rules and recipients for bridge and shoreside teams.
    - Sail with real-time guidance as zones and conditions evolve.
    - Receive an audit-ready compliance log on completion or on demand.
    - Share logs with stakeholders and iterate policies for the next voyage.
