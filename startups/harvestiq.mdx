leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Advisors miss most harvestable windows. Intraday and day-to-day volatility
      creates short-lived loss opportunities; episodic quarterly TLH misses
      60–80% of realizable losses compared to continuous monitoring.
    - >-
      Lot-level complexity across custodians. Pulling, normalizing, and
      reconciling cost-basis and wash sale data across multiple custodians and
      PMS systems is error-prone and time-consuming (5–10 hours per 100 accounts
      per month).
    - >-
      Compliance risk. Naive TLH triggers wash sales and short-term gains, or
      violates client restrictions. Many firms lack audit-ready documentation,
      approvals, and rationale for every harvest.
    - >-
      Tracking error concerns. Simple “ETF A to ETF B” swaps can materially
      increase drift from a model or IPS constraints; advisors fear performance
      dispersion and client questions.
    - >-
      Lack of measurable after-tax reporting. Advisors struggle to quantify and
      attribute “tax alpha,” hurting client communication and retention.
    - >-
      Integration friction. Existing options (direct indexing, custom SMAs)
      force model changes, new accounts, or custodian transitions. Advisors want
      to keep current models and custodians while adding TLH.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous, lot-level monitoring of taxable accounts with real-time loss
      detection thresholds (e.g., 5–10% band or volatility-adjusted bands) and
      impact scoring.
    - >-
      Optimization engine proposes harvest/replace trades that minimize tracking
      error to the client’s model/benchmark under wash sale, IPS, and
      restriction constraints.
    - >-
      Comprehensive wash sale prevention and lookback/forward detection across
      accounts and related-party accounts when data is available; automated
      alerts during the 30-day window.
    - >-
      Replacement asset library with empirically validated ETFs and equity
      baskets, pre-scored for correlation/factor exposure to keep annualized
      tracking error under target (e.g., <1.0%).
    - >-
      Advisor workflow: propose → review → client approval (digital) → route to
      custodian for execution via FIX/API or generate trade files. Includes
      supervision and compliance sign-off.
    - >-
      Audit trail, reporting, and client communication: realized loss reports,
      estimated tax impact, prevented wash sales, tracking error monitoring, and
      quarterly “tax alpha” attribution.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on, compliant, low-tracking-error tax-loss harvesting that plugs into
    your existing models, custodians, and workflows—quantified tax alpha with
    audit-grade evidence, in hours not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving library of empirically validated replacement pairs
    and baskets with measured ex-ante and ex-post tracking error, trained on
    millions of tax lots across custodians—combined with compliance-grade wash
    sale intelligence and audit trails that plug into existing advisor tech.
    This data advantage compounds with scale and is hard to replicate quickly.
