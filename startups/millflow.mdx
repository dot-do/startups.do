  problem:
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets/tribal knowledge, leading to suboptimal
      schedules that increase changeovers and overtime.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers on mills and baggers (bag size, brand,
      organic/conventional, fortification, labeling) can add 15–35% idle time
      per week if not optimized.
    - >-
      Due-date adherence suffers during demand spikes or maintenance events,
      causing OTIF performance to drop below 95% and creating expedite costs.
    - >-
      Packaging lines are the bottleneck in many mills; frequent size and
      artwork swaps reduce OEE to 50–65% vs a 70–80% target.
    - >-
      Unplanned overtime and weekend work increase labor costs by 10–25% and
      erode morale; shift-level staffing cannot be aligned quickly with plan
      changes.
    - >-
      ERP/MES modules rarely optimize sequence-dependent setups or mixed
      mill/packing capacity constraints, resulting in manual firefighting.
    - >-
      Inventory imbalances (excess finished goods for slow movers, shortages for
      fast movers) occur due to suboptimal campaign lengths and poor
      synchronization.
    - >-
      Changeovers require cleaning and QA signoffs; schedule churn creates
      quality and compliance risks.
    - >-
      Maintenance windows and QA holds are not embedded in the plan, leading to
      last-minute rework of schedules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Purpose-built optimizer for flour milling and bagging that models
      sequence-dependent changeovers by product attributes (protein range,
      enrichment, organic vs conventional, bag size, brand/artwork).
    - >-
      Multi-objective scheduling that balances due-date adherence, changeover
      cost, and overtime with configurable weights.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization when orders, downtime, or staffing change;
      preserves stability with minimal-perturbation logic.
    - >-
      Native constraints for mills and baggers: mill capacities, blend rules,
      silo inventory, QA holds, cleaning/inspection, maintenance, truck loading
      slots.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: compare campaigns (longer runs vs responsiveness),
      overtime scenarios, or alternative line assignments before committing.
    - >-
      Integration connectors to common ERPs/MES/WMS (SAP, Microsoft Dynamics,
      Aptean, iRely, Ignition, AVEVA) for orders, BOMs, inventory, and
      production confirmations.
    - >-
      Planner cockpit UI: drag-and-drop with guardrails, alerts for due-date
      risks/material shortfalls, and automatic KPI impact estimates.
    - >-
      Digital twin calibration: learn true changeover durations from historical
      signals (PLC timestamps, OEE) to refine the setup matrix over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven production and packing schedules that meet due dates while
    minimizing sequence-dependent changeovers and overtime—delivering 20–40%
    less setup time, 3–8 OEE points improvement on packing lines, and 10–25%
    less overtime within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built setup matrix and constraint library for flour milling and
    bagging, plus calibrated changeover models derived from real mill
    telemetry—enabling faster time-to-value and better schedules than generic
    APS tools. Early OEM/ERP partnerships and reference sites create data
    network effects that improve default models and benchmark KPIs.
