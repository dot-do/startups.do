  risks:
    - Misidentification of cues

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual cue sheet creation from EDLs/video is slow (30–90 minutes per
      program), error-prone, and requires specialized admin expertise.
    - >-
      Metadata fragmentation: mismatched titles, alternate titles, missing
      ISWC/IPI/CAE, territory controls and publisher splits cause rejections or
      delayed processing.
    - >-
      Inconsistent PRO requirements (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SOCAN, PRS, GEMA, APRA,
      etc.) create duplicated effort and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Lost revenue: late or missing cue sheets reduce performance royalty
      capture, especially for international distributions and long-tail
      catalogs.
    - >-
      Operational blind spots: little visibility into where a cue sheet is in
      the pipeline, who approved it, and whether the PRO accepted it; limited
      reconciliation with statements.
    - >-
      Scaling pain: volume spikes at season launches overwhelm admin teams or
      BPO vendors; quality degrades and turnaround times slip.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of EDL/AAF/FCPXML/XML and reference video; parses
      cues, durations, timecodes, reel/episode metadata.
    - >-
      Audio fingerprinting to detect unlogged cues and confirm matches;
      prioritizes matching against client catalog (ISWC/ISRC/alt titles).
    - >-
      Split resolver: auto-populates writer/publisher shares, IPIs/CAEs, society
      affiliations, and territory control rules from connected rights systems.
    - >-
      PRO-specific templates and validators; generates digital packets
      (CSV/XML/PDF) per society; automated submission via API where available or
      secure RPA; or publisher-ready submission packets.
    - >-
      Exception handling: flagged conflicts (overlapping cues, unknown works,
      multiple versions), human-in-the-loop QA queue, and change approvals with
      full history.
    - >-
      Tracking and reconciliation: submission status, acceptance confirmations,
      discrepancy alerts, and optional reconciliation against PRO performance
      statements.
    - >-
      APIs/webhooks and connectors to rights management platforms (Synchtank,
      Vistex, Counterpoint) to keep metadata synchronized.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: audit logs, SSO, role-based access, SOC 2 Type II
      roadmap, GDPR/CCPA-ready data handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From EDL/video to PRO-approved cue sheets in under 24 hours. 98%+ timecode
    accuracy, 95%+ autofill of splits from your catalog, cross-PRO formatting,
    and full audit trails—cutting processing time by 80% and increasing royalty
    capture while staying compliant.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Publisher-first design with deep rights-data integrations and
    territory-aware split logic, combined with a human-in-the-loop QA network
    and continuously updated PRO validators. Over time, proprietary training
    data and acceptance-feedback loops drive superior match accuracy and lower
    exception rates that are difficult to replicate.
