leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier COAs arrive as PDFs/emails with inconsistent formats, units, and
      analyte names, forcing QA teams to key data manually and risking
      transcription errors.
    - >-
      Manual review delays material release; lots can sit for 6–24 hours waiting
      for COA verification, creating production bottlenecks and demurrage
      charges.
    - >-
      Specs vary by ingredient, supplier, lot, and purchase order. Enforcing the
      right spec rules (including conditional limits like moisture-by-protein)
      is error-prone without automation.
    - >-
      SPC trending across lots is rarely done due to time constraints; slow
      analytical drift (e.g., protein downtrend, rising moisture) goes unnoticed
      until formulation issues or customer complaints occur.
    - >-
      Mycotoxin and micro limits (e.g., aflatoxin, fumonisin, DON, Salmonella)
      must be enforced consistently to meet FSMA PCAF and customer requirements;
      missed nonconformances pose recall and liability risk.
    - >-
      Data is trapped in COA documents; limited visibility for supplier
      scorecards, audit trails (SQF/BRCGS), and continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/LIMS QC modules are not optimized for unstructured COAs;
      integrations are brittle, and holds/releases are handled by email or phone
      calls instead of system-of-record changes.
    - >-
      Labor costs to process COAs scale with volume; a mid-size mill can spend
      1–3 FTEs on document handling and exception management.
    - >-
      Language and unit discrepancies (ppm vs ppb, % vs g/kg) and different
      methods (e.g., NIR vs wet chemistry) cause normalization errors.
    - >-
      Reactive holds: plants quarantine only after nonconformance is noticed,
      not proactively based on risk trends, leading to rework and scrap.
  solution:
    - >-
      Train a feed-specific document AI to OCR/parse multi-format supplier COAs,
      map analytes to a canonical ontology, and normalize units/methods.
    - >-
      Ingest purchase specs by material/supplier/PO from ERP/LIMS and apply
      rule-based and statistical validations (min/max, conditional,
      method-specific).
    - >-
      Run SPC on critical characteristics (e.g., protein, moisture, fat, ash,
      fiber, mycotoxins) using Western Electric/Nelson rules to detect
      drift/outliers.
    - >-
      Assign a lot-level risk score and generate actionable recommendations:
      auto-approve, quarantine/hold, request confirmatory lab test, or escalate.
    - >-
      Sync status and holds/releases back to ERP/WMS (e.g., SAP, Dynamics 365,
      Aptean/Deacom, BatchMaster) at the lot/batch level; tag inventory and stop
      movements when required.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards for supplier scorecards, exception management, and
      audit trails (SQF/BRCGS, FSMA PCAF).
    - >-
      Offer mobile/web workflows for dockside checks: scan COA, instant
      validation, and automated hold tag creation.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from user corrections to improve parsing accuracy and
      spec rule precision.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate COA ingestion and spec validation with feed-specific AI, trigger
    SPC-based alerts before production, and push hold/release decisions into
    your ERP—cutting material release time by 70%+, reducing nonconforming lots,
    and elevating audit readiness.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific COA parsing engine and analyte ontology built from
    thousands of feed-industry COAs, combined with prebuilt ERP/LIMS
    integrations that push true lot holds/releases—not just notifications—plus
    active learning from user corrections that compounds accuracy over time and
    supplier scorecard benchmarks unavailable to generic IDP or horizontal SPC
    tools.

    QA and operations leaders at Other Animal Food manufacturers who must verify
    supplier quality and release lots quickly and safely.
  problem: >-
    Supplier COAs arrive in many formats and are manually keyed, causing delays,
    errors, undetected spec drift, and audit risk—leaving teams worried a bad
    lot could slip through.

    We understand the pressure of animal safety, compliance, and throughput. Our
    AI, built with feed QA experts, reliably extracts COA data, validates specs,
    and records traceable decisions.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest: OCR and normalize supplier COAs; 2) Validate: auto-check against
    purchase specs with instant pass/fail and exceptions; 3) Control: run SPC to
    detect drift, issue alerts, and recommend release/hold—with full audit
    trails and ERP/LIMS integration.

    Direct: Schedule a demo or start a 30-day pilot. Transitional: Download the
    ROI calculator and COA mapping guide.
  success: >-
    Confident, faster lot release; early detection of process drift; fewer
    deviations and holds; audit-ready records; lower quality costs; safer feed
    and a stronger brand.
  failure: >-
    Manual errors persist, spec excursions go unnoticed, inventory sits in
    quarantine or is scrapped, audits stay stressful, and the risk of recalls or
    citations rises.
