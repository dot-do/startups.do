leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Regulatory volatility: States, counties, and cities implement bans, taxes,
      licensure, and packaging/warning changes that shift weekly; wholesalers
      struggle to track 50 states + 3,000+ localities.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone updates: Compliance teams spend 40–120 hours/month
      reading notices, updating SOPs, and pushing rules to ERP/OMS—often lagging
      weeks behind.
    - >-
      Sales leakage risk: Without automated geo/SKU enforcement, reps can sell
      restricted SKUs to prohibited jurisdictions, risking fines
      ($5k–$100k/incident), product seizures, and license revocation.
    - >-
      Fragmented sources: FDA CTP orders, Federal Register, PACT Act/USPS rules,
      state DoR/AG updates, excise tax changes, flavor bans, retailer/brand
      directories, and municipal codes live in disparate formats.
    - >-
      Audit exposure: SOPs, approvals, and change logs are not centralized or
      versioned, creating deficiencies during state audits and distributor
      vendor assessments.
    - >-
      Inefficient calendars: Filing dates, license renewals, and floor tax
      effective dates are tracked in spreadsheets, leading to missed deadlines
      and penalties.
    - >-
      Existing tools don’t enforce: General regtech alerts do not translate to
      actionable SKU/jurisdiction blocks in ERP/WMS/DSD systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously monitor federal/state/local sources (FDA CTP, Federal
      Register, state DoR/AG, tax bulletins, municipal codes) with AI-driven
      extraction and human legal analyst validation.
    - >-
      Normalize each change into a machine-readable rule (who/what/where/when)
      with applicability metadata (SKUs, flavors, nicotine strength, packaging,
      warnings, licensing class).
    - >-
      Maintain a product-to-rule knowledge graph that maps UPC/GTIN/SKU families
      to restrictions by jurisdiction and effective dates.
    - >-
      Integrate with ERP/OMS/WMS/DSD (e.g., SAP, Oracle NetSuite, Microsoft
      Dynamics, Infor, Blue Yonder) to apply geo-fenced SKU blocks and
      substitution suggestions.
    - >-
      Auto-generate and version SOP updates with redlines, route for e-sign
      approvals, and publish to field sales via LMS/portal.
    - >-
      Provide a compliance calendar (filings, renewals, effective dates, floor
      tax events) with reminders and auto-updates when dates shift.
    - >-
      Offer an audit trail: sources, interpretations, approval timestamps, and
      enforcement logs exportable for regulators and internal audits.
    - >-
      Simulate impact: run “what-if” analysis to see revenue at risk and
      inventory impact before a rule’s effective date.
    - >-
      Alerting via email/Slack/Teams/SMS with severity, jurisdictions, impacted
      SKUs/customers, and required actions.
    - >-
      Optional tax/excise feed alignment and state directory synchronization
      where applicable.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From law to sales block in under 48 hours. A tobacco/vape-specific
    regulatory intelligence and enforcement layer that monitors
    federal/state/local changes, auto-updates SOPs, and pushes
    SKU-by-jurisdiction rules into your ERP/OMS—so you never ship a banned
    product or miss a compliance deadline.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    and enforcement engine purpose-built for tobacco/vape wholesalers, with
    certified ERP connectors and human-validated interpretations—turning
