  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile demand across steel, semiconductor, and EV cycles causes 15–30%
      monthly swings, leading to stockouts or overproduction due to long lead
      times (12–20 weeks end-to-end for electrodes and specialty graphite).
    - >-
      Bottleneck resources (graphitization furnaces, impregnation, and machining
      centers) are batch/constrained; current planning tools ignore campaign
      rules, energy windows, and maintenance, resulting in 10–20% lost capacity.
    - >-
      Forecast accuracy at product-family/month is typically >25% MAPE due to
      sparse customer granularity and project-based orders; planners manually
      override with limited analytics.
    - >-
      Energy cost and CO2 exposure during furnace campaigns are poorly
      optimized; off-peak shifting and DR opportunities are missed (5–12%
      potential energy cost savings).
    - >-
      S&OP cycle is slow (2–4 weeks), highly manual, and disconnected from
      finite-capacity scheduling; plan feasibility and adherence are low (<70%).
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across ERP (SAP), MES, LIMS, and historians leads to
      slow decisions; ATP/CTP is unreliable, causing late order confirmations
      and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Yield variability (baking/graphitization) and quality lots are not modeled
      in plans, resulting in safety stock buffers and cash tied in WIP.
    - >-
      Needle coke and pitch supply shocks not translated into feasible
      reallocation/substitution plans, causing margin leakage and missed OTIF
      targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Probabilistic demand forecasting at customer/product-family/month with
      causal drivers (steel output indices, semi/PV capex, customer frame
      orders) and price-volume elasticity.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity, batch-aware optimization of baking/graphitization
      furnaces, presses/extruders, impregnation, and machining with
      setup/campaign rules and maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Energy- and emissions-aware scheduling that aligns furnace campaigns with
      off-peak tariffs and DR events while meeting due dates and WIP
      constraints.
    - >-
      Scenario planning (what-if) for supply shocks (needle coke), demand
      surges, outages; multi-objective optimization (service level, margin,
      energy, WIP).
    - >-
      ATP/CTP with feasibility checks that consider actual capacity, material
      availability, and campaign calendars; promise dates with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Yield and quality modeling using ML from LIMS and process historian data
      to predict scrap/rework risk and adjust plans/safety stocks.
    - >-
      Integrated S&OP workflow: consensus demand, constrained supply plan,
      financial reconciliation, and executive trade-offs in a single cockpit
      with audit trails.
    - >-
      Rapid integration adapters for SAP/Oracle ERP, Siemens Opcenter/AVEVA MES,
      and OSIsoft PI historians; governed data model for SKUs, recipes, and
      routing.

    Operations, supply chain, and plant leaders at carbon/graphite manufacturers
    who need confident, profitable delivery commitments.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Volatile demand, energy-price swings, and siloed data turn
    planning into guesswork.

    - External: Unreliable forecasts; furnace/press/machining bottlenecks, batch
    loading, and changeovers; late orders.

    - Internal: Planners overwhelmed and unable to trust promise dates or
    margins.

    - Philosophical: Energy-intensive, complex manufacturing shouldn’t require
    flying blind.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand multi-stage press–bake/graphitize–machine flows,
    long cycle times, energy windows, and yield risks unique to carbon/graphite.

    - Authority: Built by S&OP experts with proven deployments; integrates with
    ERP/MES; customers report higher OTIF and OEE.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect ERP/MES data, BOMs/routings, calendars, constraints, and
    energy tariffs.

    - Step 2: Co-build demand model; calibrate finite-capacity planning across
    furnaces, presses, and machining; set policies.

    - Step 3: Run scenarios and publish a feasible weekly master plan and daily
    schedules with alerts.

    - Agreements: SOC 2–grade security; human-in-the-loop approvals; reversible
    plan changes; 4–6 week pilot to value.

    - Direct: Schedule a planning assessment and sandbox integration.

    - Transitional: Download the S&OP benchmark checklist and sample scenario
    pack.
  success: >-
    - Higher OTIF (typical +5–15%) and fewer expedites via feasible,
    energy-aware schedules.

    - Margin lift (typical +2–5%) from optimal loading and tariff-aware
    planning.

    - 10–20% lower WIP/FG inventory; stable capacity across
    furnaces/presses/machines; faster, reliable promise dates.
  failure: >-
    - Continued firefighting: late shipments, stockouts, excess WIP, missed
    energy windows, costly expediting/OT, and lost customer trust.
