  problem:
    - >-
      Inventory is costly and slow: full cruises can cost $3–$7/acre (or
      $8–$15/plot) and take weeks to months; frequency is limited, leaving
      owners with stale data.
    - >-
      Existing remote-sensing products typically estimate biomass or canopy
      height, not merchantable volumes by species and product class
      (pulpwood/chip‑n‑saw/sawtimber), which mills and harvest planners actually
      need.
    - >-
      Uncertainty is rarely quantified or calibrated, leading to
      over/underestimation of yield and 1–3% revenue leakage per harvest due to
      misallocation of crews, equipment, and mill contracts.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented (cruise plots, LiDAR tiles, FIA allometry, mill specs)
      and manually stitched together, creating errors and lost analyst time.
    - >-
      Carbon, insurance, and regulatory use cases require auditable uncertainty
      and reproducible methods; most tools don’t meet that bar.
    - >-
      Operational decisions (harvest scheduling, product allocation, stumpage
      bidding) need current, stand-level estimates; existing methods don’t
      update fast enough after storms, fire, or pest outbreaks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse cruise plots, LiDAR/canopy metrics, and species/allometry libraries
      to produce merchantable volumes by species and product class
      (pulpwood/chip‑n‑saw/sawtimber) at stand/sub-stand resolution.
    - >-
      Calibrated uncertainty: Bayesian model updating with targeted, low-cost
      plots to achieve <5% bias and well-calibrated 90% prediction intervals at
      the stand level.
    - >-
      Species grouping and taper models aligned to customer mill specs; product
      class thresholds configurable per region and mill.
    - >-
      Change detection using new LiDAR, radar, and optical sources to trigger
      refreshes after disturbance or growth events; automated reprocessing to
      keep inventories current.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with GIS (Esri), inventory/cruise tools, and
      planning software to push outputs into existing workflows in hours, not
      weeks.
    - >-
      Scenario tools: estimate yield and value under different cutting specs and
      market price decks to support contract bidding and harvest scheduling.
    - >-
      QA/QC and audit trail: versioning, data provenance, and validation reports
      (per-stand error metrics, coverage tests) suitable for board reviews,
      carbon audits, and regulators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-calibrated, stand-level volumes by species and product class with
    quantified, auditable uncertainty—delivered 10x faster and 30–50% cheaper
    than conventional cruising, and directly integrated with harvest planning
    and mill specifications.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibration-first, uncertainty-quantified product mix engine trained on
    multi-source data (cruise + LiDAR + mill outturn) with region-specific
    taper/allometry libraries and targeted-plot design—yielding audit-ready
    estimates with fewer field plots and faster refresh cycles than competitors.
    Deep integrations into forestry workflows and a growing proprietary dataset
    create increasing returns to scale and switching costs.

    Timberland managers, procurement foresters, and forestry consultants who
    need defensible volume and product mix estimates for planning, bidding, and
    reporting.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented cruise data, inconsistent methods, and underused LiDAR lead to
    slow, biased estimates—creating risky bids, uncertain harvest plans, and
    reports that are hard to defend.
  guide: >-
    Timber Volume & Product Mix Estimator combines forestry expertise with
    AI—integrating cruise plots, LiDAR/canopy metrics, and species-specific
    allometry to produce transparent estimates with quantified uncertainty.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload cruise and LiDAR/canopy data or connect your GIS. 2) Configure
    species, product classes, and allometric rules. 3) Receive tract/stand
    volumes by species and product with confidence intervals, maps, and
    exports/API.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a pilot on one tract to validate against
    your ground truth.
  success: >-
    Confident bids and harvest plans, optimized product mix, higher recovery and
    revenue, faster inventory cycles, and audit-ready, defensible reports across
    your portfolio.
  failure: >-
    Rely on guesswork, misclassify product mix, over- or under-harvest, incur
    write-downs and disputes, and miss revenue due to uncertainty you could
    measure and reduce.
