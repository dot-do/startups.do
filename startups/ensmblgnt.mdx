leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Group coordinators (wedding couples, team managers, drama teachers)
      struggle to collect accurate sizes from 6–20+ participants;
      spreadsheets/text threads lead to errors and missed deadlines.
    - >-
      Rental shops and boutiques lose bookings due to inventory conflicts and
      slow coordination; average 10–20% group drop-off from first inquiry to
      confirmed reservation.
    - >-
      Sizing/fitting mistakes lead to day-of-event issues (wrong SKU, wrong
      size, color mismatch), causing refunds/rush alterations that erode
      margins.
    - >-
      Deposits and partial payments are hard to track by person/role; chasing
      balances increases admin time by 3–6 hours per group.
    - >-
      Inventory allocation across dates/locations is manual; double-booking or
      over-reserving reduces utilization and customer trust.
    - >-
      Communication fragmentation (email/SMS/DMs) creates missed approvals, late
      returns, and penalty disputes.
    - >-
      Shops lack a simple, modern portal to orchestrate multi-person rentals
      with POS/inventory integration and automated reminders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve group portal with role-based invites (e.g., groom, groomsman,
      usher; cast A/B), automated size collection, and digital agreement flows.
    - >-
      AI size prediction and SKU mapping using body-measurement survey, optional
      smartphone camera measurements, and shop-specific fit history.
    - >-
      Real-time inventory visibility and holds with configurable rules
      (auto-swap to nearest match, color/fabric constraints).
    - >-
      Payment orchestration: split deposits per person, automated reminders,
      balance collection, and configurable late fees.
    - >-
      Deadline engine with SMS/email nudges for measurements, approvals,
      pickup/return, and fitting appointments.
    - >-
      Owner dashboard: group pipeline, conflict alerts, utilization forecasts,
      exception queue (human-in-the-loop).
    - >-
      POS/inventory integrations (e.g., BridalLive, RentMy, Point of Rental) and
      barcode/RFID return tracking.
    - >-
      Shipping/pickup coordination with labels, route planning, and damage photo
      intake.
    - >-
      Analytics: on-time fulfillment, fit success rate, per-group revenue, and
      time saved.
    - >-
      White-label and embedded widgets for shop websites; planner access with
      limited permissions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-managed group rental portal that collects sizes, predicts fit, assigns
    SKUs from real-time inventory, coordinates deposits and deadlines, and keeps
    every participant on track—reducing admin time by 60%+, lifting inventory
    utilization by 8–12%, and cutting day-of fit issues by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound data advantage: SKU- and brand-specific fit outcomes across
    thousands of participants and events, combined with deep POS/inventory
    integrations. This enables higher first-try fit accuracy, smarter
    auto-substitutions, and proactive conflict resolution that competitors
    without cross-shop data cannot match. Network effects via participant
    invites and planner collaboration increase distribution over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Event organizers (weddings, teams, prom groups) who want every member
    dressed correctly, on time, and within budget—without chasing sizes,
    payments, and pickups.
  problem: >-
    External: Collecting measurements, assigning styles, reserving limited
    inventory, and wrangling deposits and deadlines is fragmented and
    error-prone.

    Internal: Organizers feel anxious they’ll miss something and be blamed.

    Philosophical: Coordinating group outfits shouldn’t be a stressful scavenger
    hunt; it should be simple and predictable.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the chaos of group fittings and last-minute changes.

    Authority: AI-driven portal with human agent oversight, integrated with
    rental inventories/POS; reliable workflows used by formalwear and costume
    shops.
  plan: >-
    1) Set up your group: event date, roles, styles/budget; connect your
    preferred shop/inventory.

    2) Invite members: collect sizes via smart form; secure deposits; AI
    validates measurements, assigns SKUs, and reserves inventory.

    3) Track to done: automated reminders for deadlines, fittings, payments,
    pickups/returns; consolidated updates and billing.
  callToAction: |-
    Primary: Start your group now.
    Secondary: Book a 15-minute setup call or try the live demo.
  success: >-
    Everyone is fitted in the right style and size; inventory is locked in
    early; deposits and payments are on track; deadlines are met; delivery,
    alterations, and returns run smoothly; photos look cohesive; the organizer
    gets compliments, not complaints.
  failure: >-
    Without a coordinator, you risk mismatched looks, stockouts, missing
    payments, late fees, lost measurements, and day-of crises that reflect
    poorly on the organizer.
