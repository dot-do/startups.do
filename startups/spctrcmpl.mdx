leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented, fast-changing regulations (REACH/CLP incl. ATP updates, SVHC
      Candidate List; TSCA Inventory, SNUR/RM rules; GHS variations by
      EU/GB/US/CA/JP/CN/KR) make manual compliance slow and error-prone
    - >-
      Mixture classification for complex imaging formulations (silver halide
      emulsions, photoinitiators, dyes/pigments, flame retardants, fluorinated
      surfactants in toner) is difficult to apply consistently across regions
    - >-
      Substance synonym/CAS mapping errors (trade names, salts, hydrates, UVCBs,
      polymer vs monomer treatment) lead to missed restrictions and
      misclassification
    - >-
      Upcoming and evolving restrictions (PFAS, microplastics, EU CLP revision,
      TSCA risk management) require rapid portfolio re-checks that overstretch
      teams
    - >-
      Generating multi-language, region-specific GHS labels and SDS sections 2/3
      takes 4–8 hours per SKU and often requires external consultants
    - >-
      Regulatory volume tracking (REACH tonnage bands, TSCA active/inactive, EU
      poison centre notifications) is siloed across spreadsheets and ERP
    - >-
      Lack of auditability (who classified what, when, based on which
      list/version) creates risk during inspections and customer audits
    - >-
      Non-compliance costs (shipment holds, recalls, fines, customer churn) and
      brand damage are high; yet ROI of tooling is hard to evidence
    - >-
      Small/mid manufacturers lack PLM/EHS integration; data lives in Excel/LIMS
      with inconsistent naming and measurement units
    - >-
      Label text errors (H/P statements, pictograms, signal words, supplemental
      EUH phrases) and missing localization delay shipments
  solution:
    - >-
      Formulation parser and normalizer: ingest spreadsheets/PLM exports; map
      trade names, IUPAC, CAS, salts/hydrates/polymer notations to a curated
      imaging-chemicals knowledge graph
    - >-
      Automated regulatory screening: check against REACH Annex XVII
      restrictions, SVHC Candidate List, REACH Annex XIV, UK REACH, TSCA
      Inventory (active/inactive), SNURs, PBT rules (incl. PIP 3:1), California
      Prop 65; configurable company watchlists
    - >-
      Mixture classification engine: implement GHS/CLP algorithms (additivity,
      bridging principles, cut-off limits) for acute tox, skin/eye, STOT,
      environmental hazards; imaging-specific heuristics (e.g., silver halide
      complexes, carbon black in toner)
    - >-
      Auto-drafted labels and SDS sections 2 and 3: region-specific H/P/EUH
      statements, pictograms, signal words, supplemental phrases; multi-language
      output (EU-27+GB, US, JP, CN, KR); print-ready templates
    - >-
      PFAS and microplastics detectors: synonym/regex/SMARTS-based screening for
      PFAS classes; alerts for EU microplastics restriction applicability to
      toners/inks
    - >-
      Change monitoring: notify when a listed substance status changes; bulk
      re-check SKUs; show delta impact and re-labeling required
    - >-
      Volume/tonnage tracking: aggregate substance usage across SKUs/sites;
      REACH band thresholds; TSCA active maintenance; exportable reports
    - >-
      Evidence and audit trail: store list versions, decision logic, user
      approvals; one-click evidence pack for inspectors/customers
    - >-
      Integrations and APIs: connectors for SAP EHS/PLM, Oracle, Teamcenter,
      ENOVIA, Arena; SSO/SCIM; secure VPC/on-prem options
    - >-
      Simulation sandbox: R&D can test substitution scenarios and instantly see
      classification/label changes before committing to reformulation
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Transform imaging chemical formulations into audit-ready, region-specific
    GHS labels and REACH/TSCA determinations in minutes, with >95% substance
    detection recall, <72-hour regulatory update latency, and seamless PLM/ERP
    integration—reducing labeling cycle time by 80% and external SDS spend by
    50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization: proprietary imaging-chemicals synonym graph and
    validated heuristics for silver halide systems, photoinitiators, and toner
    additives; evidence-backed accuracy benchmarks; rapid update pipeline; deep
    PLM/EHS integrations; early lighthouse partnerships creating

  character: >-
    Regulatory/EHS and product managers at photographic film, paper, plate,
    chemical, and copy-toner manufacturers who must keep multi-region SKUs
    compliant.
  problem: >-
    External: Constantly changing REACH/TSCA lists and regional GHS rules make
    manual checks slow and error‑prone; scattered formulation data; audit
    pressure. Internal: Fear of missing a restricted substance or mislabeling,
    risking recalls and brand damage. Philosophical: Compliance should
    accelerate innovation, not block it.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pressure of launching chemistries safely across regions
    under tight timelines. Authority: AI built with regulatory experts; mapped
    to REACH (SVHC, Annex XIV/XVII), TSCA (Inventory, restrictions), and GHS;
    validated against real SDS/labels.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload formulations (CAS/EC + % or SDS). 2) AI normalizes and
    checks against REACH/TSCA lists. 3) Auto‑draft region-specific GHS
    classifications, H/P statements, signal word, and pictograms. 4) Export
    label text and compliance report. Agreement: Confidential data handling,
    versioned audit trail, human-in-the-loop approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot with 5 SKUs. Transitional: Request a sample compliance
    report and label pack.
  success: >-
    Faster approvals, consistent EU/US/APAC labels, reduced compliance risk,
    audit‑ready documentation, fewer reworks, shorter time‑to‑market, confidence
    to scale new formulations.
  failure: >-
    Missed restrictions, shipment holds, re‑labeling costs, fines, product
    recalls, lost customer trust, stalled launches.
