leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Average terminal dwell remains high (typical Class I public reports show
      20–36 hours), with 10–40% of cars exceeding planned dwell due to
      suboptimal sequencing, track allocation, and resource conflicts.
    - >-
      Yardmasters rely on siloed data (YMS/TMS, AEI tag reads, wayside
      detectors, crew/locomotive systems) with limited predictive visibility;
      decisions are manual and reactive to congestion and track overflows.
    - >-
      Peak surges cause classification track saturation and rehandles (often
      5–15% of cuts), increasing labor, fuel, and switch wear while reducing
      throughput.
    - >-
      Existing yard systems are largely descriptive; they lack real-time
      prescriptive guidance and fast what-if scenario analysis aligned to
      safety, labor, and mechanical constraints.
    - >-
      Financial impact is material: car-hire per diem/demurrage
      ($40–$80/car/day), missed connections impair trip-plan compliance,
      overtime and re-crew events rise, and locomotives idle, eroding operating
      ratio.
    - >-
      Congestion and ad-hoc switching can elevate safety risk (shoves over
      crossings, tight curfews, and increased near-miss potential), drawing
      regulatory and community scrutiny.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from YMS/TMS, AEI readers, wayside detectors,
      hump/flat switching systems, crew/locomotive management, and weather;
      sub-minute latency event bus with data quality checks.
    - >-
      Predictive models for inbound flow, classification cycle times, departure
      readiness, and track occupancy (quantiles and confidence bands) to
      forecast congestion 1–12 hours ahead.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimization engine (MIP/CP + heuristics) that generates
      prescriptive recommendations for track allocation, cut sequencing, and
      switch lists under safety, labor, track, and power constraints.
    - >-
      Digital twin of each yard to simulate plans and run quick what-if
      scenarios (e.g., surge arrivals, track outages, crew shortages) with KPIs
      and risk scores.
    - >-
      Operator UI for yardmasters/terminal managers: occupancy heatmaps,
      predicted dwell distributions, plan vs. actual, and one-click plan
      adoption with audit and rollbacks.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution via APIs back to YMS/TMS/hump control for plan
      application; monitors adherence and automatically re-optimizes with
      perturbations.
    - >-
      Recommendation explainability: shows constraint drivers (e.g., handbrake
      rules, clearance points), resource conflicts, and expected KPI impact
      before acceptance.
    - >-
      Safety guardrails: configurable rulebook and SOP enforcement with hard
      constraints; recommendations are blocked if safety thresholds are
      violated.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, explainable prescriptive AI that reduces average yard dwell by
    10–20%, increases throughput by 5–12% (cars/hour), cuts rehandles by 20–40%,
    and improves on-time departures by 8–15% by optimizing sequencing, track
    allocation, and resource usage within safety and labor
    constraints—deployable on-prem or in VPC and integrated with existing yard
    systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-yard training data and a constraint-aware optimization engine
    purpose-built for rail yards, combined with prebuilt integrations to
    dominant YMS/TMS systems and a safety rules framework. Early reference yards
    with audited ROI and a change-management playbook reduce buyer risk and
    shorten time-to-value. Potential IP around yard-specific prescriptive
    optimization and explainability.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Terminal and yard operations leaders who need to cut dwell and increase
    throughput without adding tracks or crews.
  problem: >-
    Yards clog when events shift and data is siloed—mis-sequenced cuts,
    suboptimal track use, misaligned crews/locos—driving unpredictable dwell,
    missed connections, overtime, and wasted capacity.
  guide: >-
    We understand the minute-by-minute pressure to keep yards fluid. Built by
    rail ops and data scientists, our AI ingests yard events and lineups in real
    time, explains recommendations, and aligns with operating rules—secure,
    integrable, and pragmatic.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data (AEI/TE, car events, switch lists, YMS/TMS, train lineups,
    crew/locos). 2) Analyze via a yard digital twin to detect bottlenecks and
    simulate sequencing/track allocation. 3) Act with ranked move lists and KPIs
    via dashboard/API, then iterate.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or launch a pilot in one yard to validate impact on dwell and
    throughput.
  success: >-
    Fluid yards with shorter car dwell, higher trains-per-day, on-time
    departures, fewer re-crews, clearer shift plans, and a repeatable playbook
    that scales network-wide.
  failure: >-
    Without it, firefighting continues—persistent bottlenecks, rising dwell,
    missed service windows, idle assets, overtime, and lost capacity that erodes
    customer trust.
