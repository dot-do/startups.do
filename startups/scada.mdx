leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Alarm floods overwhelm controllers during transients (starts/stops, batch
      changes, pigging), causing >30 alarms/10 minutes/operator vs ISA 18.2
      target of ≤10.
    - >-
      High nuisance/standing alarm rates (often 20–40% of daily alarms) mask
      true safety or equipment anomalies.
    - >-
      Manual triage is slow and inconsistent; mean time to acknowledge/triage
      (MTTA) often >20 minutes for complex multi-station events.
    - >-
      Root cause is unclear across correlated tags (flow, suction/discharge
      pressure, temperature, KPIs), leading to unnecessary shutdowns or missed
      incidents.
    - >-
      Existing rules-based analytics and generic ML tools require heavy manual
      configuration and don’t adapt to changing hydraulic states, seasonal
      effects, or station maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Regulatory and audit pressure (PHMSA, ISA 18.2, EEMUA 191) requires alarm
      rationalization and performance reporting; generating evidence is
      labor-intensive.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play connectors to AVEVA PI (PI Data Archive/AF/EF), OPC UA, and
      common SCADA historians; read-only via DMZ with store-and-forward.
    - >-
      Real-time multivariate anomaly detection that auto-segments by operating
      state (steady, ramp, batch transition, pigging, maintenance) to prevent
      false positives.
    - >-
      Event clustering and ranking: correlates alarms/tags from station to
      system level to surface the true initiating event with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: causal graphs and contribution scores (per tag/KPI) with
      recommended actions and links to SOPs.
    - >-
      Nuisance alarm suppression suggestions and alarm performance analytics
      mapped to ISA 18.2/EEMUA 191 KPIs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop triage: controllers accept/override classifications;
      system learns and retrains with feedback.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: creates incident tickets (ServiceNow/Maximo), sends
      summaries to Teams/Email, and adds shift-handover reports.
    - >-
      Governance and audit: versioned models, change logs, event frames, and
      compliance dashboards for PHMSA audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From alarm floods to actionable, explained anomalies. The agent ranks,
    clusters, and explains abnormal signals across
    flow/pressure/temperature/station KPIs in real time, reducing alarm noise by
    50–70%, cutting MTTA by 60–80%, and producing audit-ready reports—without
    changing your SCADA or control logic (read-only, ISA 18.2-aligned).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A pipeline-specific anomaly library and hydraulics-aware, state-segmented
    models combined with a causal knowledge graph deliver accurate, explainable
    triage under transient conditions where generic analytics fail. Deep
    PI/SCADA integrations, ISA 18.2-aligned reporting, and a read-only,
    fail-open OT deployment pattern reduce security and change-management
    friction, accelerating adoption and regulatory acceptance.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline control room managers and SCADA/PI analysts responsible for safe,
    compliant, and efficient crude oil pipeline operations 24/7.
  problem: >-
    External: Floods of alarms and noisy PI/SCADA signals across flow, pressure,
    temperature, and station KPIs obscure real issues. Internal: Controllers
    feel fatigued, reactive, and worried about missing weak signals.
    Philosophical: Safety‑critical operations deserve clear, trustworthy signal
    triage—not noise.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand alarm fatigue, audit pressure, and the stakes of
    pipeline incidents. Authority: An AI triage agent that ranks, clusters, and
    explains anomalies; integrates with PI/SCADA; read‑only and secure
    (on‑prem/VPC); aligned to API RP 1167 and ISA/IEC 62443; built with pipeline
    SMEs to deliver auditable, actionable insights.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect—read‑only to PI/SCADA; 2) Calibrate—learn normal
    patterns and tune with SME feedback; 3) Triage—deliver ranked clusters with
    plain‑language explanations to alarm consoles and shift reports. Agreement:
    No control writes; data stays in your environment; clear success metrics and
    audits from day one.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a 4‑week pilot on a target
    segment. Transitional: Download the technical brief and ROI calculator, or
    run a historical backtest on sample data.
  success: >-
    Controllers focus on actionable anomalies; MTTD/MTTR drop; alarm noise
    shrinks; fewer false trips and incidents; stabilized throughput and station
    KPIs; clean audit trails and improved alarm management maturity.
  failure: >-
    Without triage, alarm floods persist; weak signals go unnoticed; downtime
    and spill risk rise; fines and audit findings accumulate; teams burn out and
    over‑alert, eroding safety culture.
