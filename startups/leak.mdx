  problem:
    - >-
      Pipeline operators struggle to detect and localize leaks quickly using
      single-modality tools (SCADA pressure/flow imbalance or periodic LDAR)
      leading to long time-to-detect (days-weeks) and costly, unfocused truck
      rolls.
    - >-
      External methane observations (satellite/airborne/mobile) are episodic,
      noisy, weather-dependent, and rarely reconciled with real-time hydraulics
      or operations logs, causing false positives/negatives and alert fatigue.
    - >-
      Regulatory and financial pressure is rising (PHMSA leak detection/repair
      requirements; EPA Methane Emissions Reduction Program fee $900–$1,500/ton
      CH4; growing ESG scrutiny), but existing systems don’t provide defensible,
      auditable, fused evidence and dispatch guidance.
    - >-
      Operators lack an integrated geospatial risk picture that fuses SCADA
      anomalies, RTTM results, methane plume detections, fiber DAS/acoustic
      events, and work orders to prioritize high-likelihood leaks and minimize
      safety/environmental impact.
    - >-
      Integration friction (SCADA historians, GIS, WMS like Maximo/SAP, fiber
      DAS, satellite vendors) delays deployments and prevents scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion engine: Bayesian/probabilistic inference that combines
      hydraulic residuals (pressure/flow/RTTM), methane plume detections
      (satellite/airborne/mobile), fiber DAS/acoustic signatures, weather,
      terrain, and operations logs to produce a per-segment leak likelihood
      (0–1) and estimated leak rate with uncertainty bands.
    - >-
      Real-time geospatial UI: A dynamic map showing pipeline centerline, HCAs,
      land use, wind vectors, candidate leak locations with confidence
      intervals, and prioritized dispatch recommendations.
    - >-
      Dispatch guidance & workflow: Auto-generation of work orders (SAP PM/IBM
      Maximo), crew routing, and skill/equipment matching; integrates with
      existing OMS and notification systems.
    - >-
      Data connectors & normalization: Production-grade connectors to PI System
      (AVEVA/OSIsoft), Honeywell/Emerson/Yokogawa SCADA, Esri GIS, fiber DAS
      (Silixa/OptaSense), satellite providers (GHGSat, MethaneSAT, Carbon
      Mapper, Satelytics), drone/mobile LDAR vendors; handles QA/QC and
      metadata.
    - >-
      Backtesting & model governance: Replay historical incidents to quantify
      precision/recall, P95 time-to-detect, and calibration; exportable audit
      trails for regulators and insurers.
    - >-
      Compliance & reporting: Automated generation of PHMSA/EPA-ready reports
      (event logs, evidence packages, repair timelines, emission estimates,
      avoided emissions).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A single, auditable leak likelihood map and dispatch engine that fuses
    SCADA/RTTM imbalances with satellite methane detections, LDAR, and fiber DAS
    to cut time-to-detect/localize by 50–80%, reduce false-positive truck rolls
    by 30–60%, and lower methane fee and compliance risk—delivered as a secure,
    integrable SaaS with regulatory-ready reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Field-validated, cross-modality labeled dataset and Bayesian fusion IP that
    converts heterogeneous signals into calibrated leak probabilities and
    dispatch guidance tied to HCA risk, with deep integrations to SCADA/GIS/WMS.

    regulatory-audited reporting workflows create defensible switching costs.

  character: >-
    Pipeline integrity, control-room, and environmental managers at natural-gas
    transmission operators who want a reliable, fast, auditable way to detect,
    locate, and prioritize leaks without adding alarm noise.
  problem: >-
    External: SCADA imbalances are noisy; satellite/LDAR/DAS data are siloed;
    small/intermittent leaks evade single-sensor detection. Internal: Teams lack
    confidence on when and where to dispatch. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have
    to trade safety and emissions for uptime—leaks should be findable, provable,
    and fixable fast. Villain: Data fragmentation and alarm fatigue.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand control-room overload, field safety, and compliance
    pressure. Authority: Fusion AI combines SCADA pressure/flow with satellite
    methane, LDAR, and acoustic/fiber DAS to produce an explainable
    leak-likelihood map, confidence scores, and recommended actions; integrates
    with existing SCADA/PI/CMMS via secure APIs; aligned with PHMSA IM and EPA
    reporting workflows.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect data sources (SCADA, satellite, LDAR, DAS). 2) Calibrate
    on your network and history. 3) Fuse signals to generate leak-likelihood
    maps. 4) Alert with location, size estimate, and dispatch guidance. 5) Close
    the loop with evidence and reports. Agreement: read-only data access,
    customer-controlled thresholds, measurable alert quality, and a pilot before
    scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a data assessment and live demo. Transitional: Run a 60–90
    day pilot on a priority segment using your historical events; receive a
    leak-likelihood map and dispatch playbook.
  success: >-
    Faster detection and localization; fewer false alarms and truck rolls; lower
    methane intensity and product loss; streamlined PHMSA/EPA and ESG reporting
    with auditable evidence; improved safety and uptime; stronger stakeholder
    trust.
  failure: >-
    Undetected or mislocated methane releases; emergency shutdowns and product
    loss; regulatory fines and investigations; reputational damage; wasted OPEX
    on noise-driven dispatch.

  problem:
    - >-
      Signals are scattered across SCADA, satellite, LDAR, and DAS—triage is
      slow and manual.
    - False positives trigger costly truck rolls while real leaks hide in noise.
    - Small or persistent leaks evade static thresholds and routine surveys.
    - 'Slow detection increases methane emissions, loss, and regulatory exposure.'

    - >-
      Unify every signal into one probabilistic leak map with confidence
      scoring.
