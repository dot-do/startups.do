  title: Variable-Rate Seeding (VRS) Prescriptions for Soybean
  description: >-
    Generate field/zone-specific soybean seeding rates to optimize population by
    productivity potential and risk.
  targetUsers:
    - Soybean growers with planters capable of VRS
    - Agronomy service providers
  triggers:
    - 4–8 weeks before planting
    - Upon receipt of new soil EC/elevation/yield layers
  inputs:
    - Field boundaries
    - 3–5 years of yield maps (or proxy indices)
    - 'Soil EC/texture, elevation/DEM, drainage layers'
    - 'Planter capabilities (min/max pop, section width)'
    - Seed cost and target ROI
  steps:
    - Assemble and normalize layers; create management zones
    - Model population response curves by zone
    - 'Apply constraints (machine, agronomy limits)'
    - Simulate ROI and create A/B test strips
    - Export prescriptions; prepare operator notes
    - 'Optional: push to Ops Center/FieldView'
  tools:
    - QGIS/GDAL/Shapely
    - scikit-learn/lightGBM
    - John Deere Ops Center/FieldView prescription APIs
    - ISOXML/Shapefile writers
  outputs:
    - ISOXML/Shape/GeoJSON variable-rate seeding files
    - Zone maps and PDF rationale
    - ROI summary and A/B test layout
  pricingModel:
    - Per acre per season
    - Per field per prescription
    - Bundle with in-season monitoring
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Poor-quality historical data can bias zones
    - Planter calibration issues reduce impact
    - Seed company policies/traits may constrain rates
  dependencies:
    - Access to historical yield/soil layers
    - Planter file format compatibility
    - Farmer sign-off on agronomy assumptions

  problem:
    - >-
      Most soybean seeding rates are static across variable fields, leaving
      yield on the table in high-productivity zones and wasting seed in
      low-response zones.
    - >-
      Growers face high spatial variability (soil, topography, drainage,
      historical yield) but lack an easy, data-driven way to set population by
      zone.
    - >-
      Existing prescriptions are often generic or based on corn heuristics, not
      soybean-specific response-to-population curves and risk factors (planting
      date, seed treatment, disease, stand loss).
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across yield monitors, satellite imagery, soil maps,
      and equipment platforms; growers and agronomists spend hours cleaning and
      exporting data to build basic VRS maps.
    - >-
      It’s hard to validate ROI; few tools create on-planter test strips and tie
      as-planted data to yield, making it difficult to measure benefits and
      iterate.
    - >-
      Seed costs remain significant; a 10–20k seeds/acre misallocation can erase
      profits at current seed prices ($55–$70 per 140k unit).
    - >-
      Integration friction: prescriptions must work reliably with John Deere,
      Case IH, AGCO, Trimble, and Ag Leader. Format errors at planting are
      costly.
    - >-
      Risk management is limited: most tools don’t dynamically adjust for
      planting date, emergence risk, or short-term weather, which heavily
      influence optimal soybean populations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and cleanup: Pull field boundaries, historical yield (3–5
      years), as-applied, soil (SSURGO/soil EC), topography (LiDAR/RTK),
      satellite vigor indices, planting windows, and local weather/risk layers.
    - >-
      Zone creation: Automated, explainable management zones using multi-year
      yield stability, soil productivity indices, and terrain-derived wetness;
      agronomist can edit zones in-app.
    - >-
      Risk-adjusted population model: Soybean-specific ML models using
      response-to-population curves by zone, adjusting for seed treatment, row
      spacing, planting date, and forecasted emergence risk.
    - >-
      One-click exports: Generate variable-rate prescriptions in formats
      compatible with John Deere Ops Center, Climate FieldView, Ag Leader, Case
      IH AFS, Trimble, and AGCO; QA checks prevent planter errors.
    - >-
      Test strips and A/B designs: Auto-generate randomized check strips (e.g.,
      ±15k seeds) per zone to validate performance and calibrate next year’s
      rates.
    - >-
      In-season updates: Optional re-issued prescriptions if planting is delayed
      or extreme weather risk triggers (e.g., cold/wet soils) adjust expected
      stand.
    - >-
      ROI and compliance reporting: Post-harvest analytics connect as-planted,
      stand counts, and yield to quantify bu/acre lift and seed savings per
      field and whole-farm.
    - >-
      Workflow for teams: Retailer/agronomist dashboards for multi-grower
      management, approvals, notes, and version history.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Profit-first, soybean-specific VRS prescriptions that deliver 0.5–1.5
    bu/acre average yield lift and/or 8k–20k seeds/acre savings, integrated with
    your existing equipment, produced in under 24 hours and validated with
    on-planter test strips—guaranteed positive ROI or you don’t pay.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A soybean-only, risk-adjusted VRS engine trained on a large, curated dataset
    of population–yield–environment triplets, plus deep integrations that
    minimize planter-side failures, and a closed-loop validation system
    (randomized strips + ROI reporting) that compounds learning and trust.
    Outcome-backed pricing and an agronomist-in-the-loop workflow further
    differentiate vs. generic VRA tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Soybean growers and farm managers who want maximum yield and ROI per acre
    without wasting seed.
  problem: >-
    Flat-rate seeding ignores field variability, causing wasted seed, missed
    yield, and time spent guessing at maps.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit yields while controlling seed spend; our
    AI, trained on multi-year yield, soil, and weather data, delivers validated
    zone-based prescriptions.
  plan: >-
    Upload field boundaries and historic layers; our AI builds zones and optimal
    soybean rates by productivity and risk; export prescriptions to your
    planter.
  callToAction: >-
    Request a demo and start a one-field pilot—upload shapefiles to receive your
    first VRS prescription.
  success: >-
    Right-sized populations, uniform stands, higher and more stable yields,
    lower seed cost per bushel, and clear by-zone ROI.
  failure: >-
    Keep overspending on seed, underperforming in high-potential acres, risking
    poor stands in tough zones, and leaving bushels and profit in the field.

      manage risk.
    ctaText: Book a Demo
    ctaHref: /book-demo
  problem:
    - >-
      One static rate wastes seed in low-potential zones and underplants
      high-potential areas.
    - 'Manual VRS is slow, subjective, and hard to repeat across fields.'
    - >-
      It’s difficult to weigh soil, yield history, elevation, and planting risk

      AI converts your data into stable soybean management zones and sets the
      right population per zone.
    - >-
      Risk-aware adjustments for emergence, late planting, drought, and lodging
      proxies.

## Integration with .do Platform

These workflow functions integrate with the broader .do ecosystem:

- **Functions.do**: Each workflow function can be registered as an AI Function for autonomous execution
- **Workflows.do**: Complex multi-step processes can be orchestrated across functions
- **Agents.do**: Autonomous agents can execute these workflows based on triggers and events
- **Database.do**: Customer data, field data, and results are managed through the unified data layer

The Business-as-Code approach enables SoyRate AI to operate as an autonomous digital business, with clear workflows for every aspect of the operation from customer acquisition to product delivery and validation.
