  problem:
    - >-
      Shop and sales drawings for standard window/door families take 2–6 hours
      per opening and tie up sales engineers/drafters during peak bid periods.
    - >-
      High rework rates (15–30%) from profile/hardware incompatibilities,
      clearances, or local code/specification mismatches cause delays and cost
      overruns.
    - >-
      Inconsistent output across teams and loss of tribal knowledge when staff
      churn occurs or subcontracted drafting is used.
    - >-
      GC/architect redlines lead to multiple submission cycles; first-pass
      approval rates below 60% are common.
    - >-
      Slow, manual quoting and takeoff due to fragmented tools; duplicate data
      entry between CAD, BOM, and ERP.
    - >-
      Limited access to up-to-date extrusion/hardware libraries and rules;
      maintaining them is time-consuming.
    - >-
      Existing configurators are expensive, heavy to implement, and often locked
      to a single system supplier; generic CAD lacks guardrails and automation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Spec Wizard: Form-based spec intake (family, system, dimensions,
      mullion/transom layout, glazing thickness, hardware set, finish,
      performance requirements) with live feasibility checks.
    - >-
      Parametric Engine: Constraint-based templates for common families (e.g.,
      casement, awning, slider, fixed, swing door, sliding door, bifold,
      storefront bays) with auto-dimensioning and standard annotations.
    - >-
      Rules & Compliance: Built-in clearance, hardware compatibility,
      gasket/glass thickness, and fabrication rules; regional standards
      checklists (e.g., ASTM/AAMA/FGIA, EN 14351-1) flagged as notes for
      reviewer.
    - >-
      Auto Outputs: One-click DXF (profiles, parts, fabrication details) and PDF
      sheets (plan/elevation/sections/notes); plus BOM, cut list, and hardware
      schedules in CSV/ERP formats.
    - >-
      Library Coverage: Curated extrusion/hardware libraries mapped to multiple
      systems (e.g., Kawneer, YKK AP, Schüco, Reynaers, AluK, Technal),
      versioned and kept current.
    - >-
      Integrations: AutoCAD plugin for in-drafting workflows; REST API/webhooks;
      ERP/MRP exports (e.g., Epicor, NetSuite, JobBOSS, Odoo).
    - >-
      Collaboration & Audit: Version control, change logs, redline compare,
      approval workflow, and template locking for QA.
    - >-
      Analytics: Lead-time tracking, first-pass approval rates, error taxonomy,
      and throughput per user/team.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From spec to approved DXF/PDF in minutes. Spec2Shop converts simple inputs
    (dimensions, opening type, system, glazing, hardware) into validated,
    parameterized assemblies, dimensioned shop drawings, BOMs, and cut lists
    with built-in system rules and code checks—cutting turnaround time by 70–90%
    and reducing rework by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-validated, multi-system rule libraries and parametric templates
    co-developed with major system suppliers, combined with a growing
    proprietary dataset of spec-to-drawing mappings and redline feedback. This
    shortens deployment from months to days and yields superior first-pass
    approvals and speed that generic CAD or single-system configurators struggle
    to match.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Metal window and door manufacturers—engineering leads, drafters, and
    estimators—who want fast, accurate shop/sales drawings and DXF exports from
    specs without manual redrawing.
  problem: >-
    Villain: slow, error‑prone manual CAD. External: drafting standard families
    ties up engineers, creates backlogs, and causes rework. Internal: constant
    deadline pressure and fear of mistakes. Philosophical: generating a standard
    frame should be instant, consistent, and correct.
  guide: >-
    We understand last‑minute submittals and tolerance stacks. Shop/Sales
    Drawing Assistant is an AI parametric CAD service that turns specs into
    consistent assemblies and drawings for standard window/door
    families—exporting clean DXFs and PDFs. Secure, versioned, and shop‑ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload specs (dimensions, frame series, glazing, hardware, finish). 2)
    Review AI‑generated parametric assembly, BOM, and shop/sales drawings;
    adjust constraints. 3) Export DXF/PDF to ERP/CAM; lock templates and
    standards; one‑click revisions.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot with your top
    families. Transitional: Download sample DXF/PDF and the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Turnaround in minutes, not days; 70–90% less drafting time; cleaner,
    shop‑ready DXFs; fewer change orders; faster, more accurate bids; on‑time
    submittals; scale capacity without extra headcount.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines, lost bids, inconsistent drawings, costly rework,
    overstaffed drafting, and noisy cut files on the shop floor.
