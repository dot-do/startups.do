  problem:
    - >-
      Color drift across dye lots causes out-of-spec ΔE*00 results, rework,
      shade sorting, and customer claims.
    - >-
      QC data from spectrophotometers (Datacolor, X‑Rite) sits in spreadsheets
      or vendor tools without proactive trend detection or cross-line SPC.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow and tribal; corrective actions are
      inconsistent and not verified for effectiveness.
    - >-
      Instrument-to-instrument disagreement and poor standard hygiene (aging
      standards, light-source mismatch, calibration lapses) create measurement
      variation misdiagnosed as process variation.
    - >-
      Manufacturers lack a closed-loop CAPA workflow tied to objective color
      data and process parameters.
  solution:
    - >-
      Vendor-agnostic ingestion of spectrophotometer exports (CSV/XLSX/XML) and
      direct APIs where available; automatic parsing of L*, a*, b*, ΔE*00 vs
      standards and tolerances.
    - >-
      Real-time SPC on color metrics: X̄-R control charts, CUSUM/EWMA for drift
      detection, stability indices per line/recipe/fiber lot.
    - >-
      AI-driven root-cause suggestions mapping color error vectors to likely
      process factors (e.g., L* low → insufficient bleaching or over-dye; a*
      positive drift on nylon → red component concentration or bath pH).
    - >-
      Corrective action calculators: recommended recipe adjustments (dye
      concentration %, salt/alkali, temperature ramp and hold, liquor ratio,
      pad/mangle pressure) within site-defined safe bounds.
    - >-
      Instrument health and metrology checks: standard aging alerts, white tile
      verification, inter-instrument agreement monitoring, illuminant/observer
      mismatch detection (D65/TL84/10°).
    - >-
      CAPA workflows: 5-Why templates, fishbone
      (Man/Machine/Method/Material/Measurement/Environment), approval routing,
      effectiveness checks, and SOP updates; automatic linkage to the triggering
      lots and charts.
    - >-
      Lab-to-bulk transfer modeling: coefficients per substrate/process to
      predict bulk ΔE from lab match data; alerts when transfer coefficients
      drift.
    - >-
      Digital shade standard management: versioning, expiry, golden sample
      refresh cadence, and audit trail.
    - >-
      Notifications and visualization: role-based dashboards; alerts in
      email/Teams/Slack; optional stack light/andon integration on lines.
    - >-
      Data connectors to MES/ERP/LIMS for lot metadata (recipe, line, operator,
      bath temp/pH, fiber lot) to improve diagnostics and traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Proactively reduce shade defects and rework by monitoring CIELAB/ΔE*00
    against your standards, predicting drift before lots fail, and guiding
    operators through data-driven corrective and preventive actions with
    closed-loop CAPA.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic, physics-informed AI that turns ΔE*00 error vectors into
    actionable, machine- and chemistry-specific corrections, paired with a
    closed-loop CAPA system and a growing cross-mill dataset for rapid,
    high-precision drift detection.
