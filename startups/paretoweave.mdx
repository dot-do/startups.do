  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection is inconsistent and slow, leading to high
      variability in defect detection across operators and shifts.
    - >-
      Most mills lack timely, granular defect data; Pareto charts and trend
      analyses are created weekly/monthly (or not at all), delaying corrective
      actions.
    - >-
      Fixed-camera vision systems are costly (capex $50k–$250k per line) and
      inflexible for mixed products, small batches, and frequent changeovers
      characteristic of miscellaneous textile product mills.
    - >-
      Smartphone photos are already taken on the floor, but they are not
      standardized or analyzed, so valuable data is lost in chats, emails, and
      paper logs.
    - >-
      Quality teams spend 10–20 hours/week on manual tallying and reporting,
      which could be automated and redeployed to process improvement.
    - >-
      Small/mid-size mills face skills gaps in data/AI and cannot afford
      in-house ML teams or long integration projects.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly demand traceability, FPY/yield metrics, and
      supplier quality data, but mills struggle to provide consistent,
      audit-ready evidence.
    - >-
      Rework/scrap rates (often 2–6% of throughput) are accepted as “normal” due
      to lack of near-real-time insights to identify top defect drivers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app (Android/iOS) with capture guidance: lighting prompts, focus
      checks, and a color/scale reference card ensures consistent images.
    - >-
      AI defect classifier tuned for textiles with a configurable taxonomy
      (e.g., hole, fray, misweave, shade variation, oil mark, foreign fiber,
      seam slippage, skew/bow, thick/thin places).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: low-confidence predictions are queued for
      supervisor validation to continuously improve the model.
    - >-
      Instant Pareto charts, trends by line/shift/lot/SKU, and heatmaps of
      defect locations; export to PDF/CSV for audits.
    - >-
      Alerts when defect rates exceed thresholds (e.g., p95 vs. baseline) or
      when a specific defect spikes on a line/shift.
    - >-
      Offline capture and sync for poor-connectivity areas; edge compression to
      reduce bandwidth by 60–80%.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common MES/ERP (CSV/SFTP/API) for lot/recipe
      context and closed-loop corrective actions.
    - >-
      Multi-language UI and training content for operators; role-based access
      controls for QA/Ops/Management.
    - >-
      On-prem or VPC-deployed inference option for data-sensitive customers,
      with SLA-backed uptime and support.
    - >-
      Pilot-to-scale program: 6–8 weeks to deploy, measure baseline vs.
      post-implementation KPIs, and formalize scale-out plan.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and production leaders at miscellaneous textile product mills who
    want fast, consistent defect detection and clear Pareto/trend insight from
    simple phone photos.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and hard to standardize;
    photos pile up without structured labels; Pareto charts and trends are
    tedious to maintain.

    Internal: Teams feel reactive, guessing what to fix next and struggling to
    prove improvement in audits.

    Philosophical: People who make great textiles shouldn’t be spreadsheet
    clerks—quality decisions should be driven by timely, trustworthy evidence.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to keep lines running while preventing costly
    defects and chargebacks. Our team blends manufacturing AI and textile QC
    know‑how, mapping your defect taxonomy, training with your images, and
    supporting inspectors so adoption is simple and confidence is high.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Capture: Snap a photo in the mobile app or upload a batch.

    2) Classify: AI tags defect type, severity, and location using your
    taxonomy.

    3) Verify: Operators accept/adjust labels; edge cases flagged for review.

    4) Improve: Live dashboards produce Pareto and trend reports; export to
    PDF/CSV/ERP.

    5) Act: Weekly insights highlight top drivers and actions.

    Agreement plan:

    - Data privacy: your images stay private; encryption in transit/at rest.

    - Quality: agreed accuracy targets per defect, with continuous learning from
    feedback.

    - Simplicity: clear pricing and a low‑risk pilot before rollout.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot or book a 30‑minute demo.

    Transitional: Download a sample Pareto report and ROI calculator; get the
    inspection-readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - Consistent, faster inspections from any smartphone.

    - Clear Pareto and trends that focus teams on the few defects driving most
    losses.

    - Reduced scrap, rework, and customer returns; stronger audit readiness.

    - Shared taxonomy and visuals that align operators, engineers, and
    suppliers.

    - Data-backed continuous improvement that lifts yield, OEE, and margins.
  failure: >-
    Without this, inspection stays inconsistent and slow; defect patterns stay
    hidden; scrap and chargebacks erode margins; teams waste time wrangling
    photos and spreadsheets; audits remain stressful and reactive.
