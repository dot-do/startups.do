  problem:
    - >-
      Designing a high‑converting hero section takes 2–6 hours per page
      (briefing, copy, layout, assets, responsiveness, accessibility), slowing
      launches and billable throughput for designers and agencies.
    - >-
      Responsive variants are inconsistent; mobile usually gets a rushed
      adaptation, hurting Core Web Vitals and conversion on smaller screens.
    - >-
      Handoff to devs is error‑prone: designers provide static mocks; developers
      re‑interpret spacing, breakpoints, and typography, causing rework and
      scope creep.
    - >-
      Non‑design teams (founders, marketers) lack the skill to create on‑brand,
      modern heroes quickly for tests and campaigns.
    - >-
      A/B testing ideas for hero treatments is slow because creating multiple
      polished variants is expensive.
    - >-
      Maintaining brand consistency across many pages/clients is hard without a
      systemized, reusable hero library.
  solution:
    - >-
      Brief‑to‑Design: Accept a short text brief or a URL; auto‑extract brand
      colors, logo, fonts, and value proposition to propose 3–5 hero concepts.
    - >-
      Responsive by default: Output desktop, tablet, and mobile compositions
      with fluid type and spacing scales, ensuring WCAG AA contrast and
      optimized LCP.
    - >-
      Dev handoff: Export clean CSS/HTML snippets, CSS variables, and
      Tailwind/Framer/Webflow/WordPress block presets; include tokens for
      colors, typography, and spacing.
    - >-
      Copy and visual generation: Suggest headlines/subheads/CTAs aligned to the
      brief; generate or source imagery (stock/AI) with safe‑use filters.
    - >-
      Variant engine: One‑click A/B/C variants (layout, imagery, copy, CTA
      emphasis) with best‑practice heuristics; annotate expected impact based on
      prior performance data.
    - >-
      Brand kits: Upload or auto‑create brand kits (logo, palette, type scale,
      tone of voice) and lock adherence across outputs.
    - >-
      Analytics loop: Optional lightweight snippet to track hero CTR/scroll
      depth/LCP; feed learned signals into future recommendations.
    - >-
      Design tool integration: Figma plugin for direct insertion as auto‑layout
      components; Webflow/Framer components; WordPress Gutenberg block.
    - >-
      Accessibility and performance checks: Contrast, alt text, heading
      structure, content density, and image optimization suggestions.
