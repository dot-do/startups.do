  problem:
    - >-
      Preparing state- and permit-specific SWPPP documents is time consuming
      (4–12 hours per project) and error-prone, leading to rework, delays in NOI
      filing, and exposure to fines.
    - >-
      Contractors miss inspection windows (weekly and post-storm) due to manual
      calendars and inconsistent weather tracking, risking penalties and
      stop-work orders.
    - >-
      Rain-event thresholds vary by permit; tracking local rainfall with
      sufficient accuracy and documenting events for audits is difficult without
      site-specific weather intelligence.
    - >-
      Field logs, photos, and corrective actions are scattered across emails,
      spreadsheets, and notebooks, making audit response slow and costly.
    - >-
      Consultants are expensive for small to mid-size projects and don’t scale
      well across many concurrent sites; generic PM tools don’t handle SWPPP
      nuance.
    - >-
      Turnover and subcontractor variability cause gaps in training records, BMP
      maintenance, and signature compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven SWPPP authoring: Collect project details (location, acreage,
      soils/slope, receiving waters, BMPs) and output permit-ready SWPPP with
      maps, signatures, and submittal package.
    - >-
      Permit-aware compliance calendar: Auto-build weekly and storm-triggered
      inspection schedules aligned to the specific CGP/state permit (e.g., 0.5"
      in 24 hrs by default; configurable by permit).
    - >-
      Weather intelligence: Monitor NOAA/NWS radar/QPE and nearby gauges;
      compute site polygon precipitation; trigger alerts and auto-generate Rain
      Event Documentation and inspection tasks.
    - >-
      Mobile-first field app: Guided inspection checklists, geotagged photo
      capture, offline mode, corrective action tracking with deadlines, and
      e-signature capture.
    - >-
      Audit-ready records: Immutable logs, time/user stamps, version history,
      and one-click export of a complete SWPPP binder (PDF/ZIP) including
      inspections, training, CAPA, and rain logs.
    - >-
      Integrations: Push tasks/docs to Procore/Autodesk; map layers from Esri;
      e-sign via DocuSign; SMS/email alerts to supervisors and inspectors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate permit-ready SWPPP plans in under 30 minutes and keep every site
    audit-ready with automated inspection calendars, site-specific rain-event
    alerts, and tamper-proof logs—reducing missed inspections by 70–90% and
    SWPPP admin time by 60–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Permit-aware AI plus site-polygon rainfall detection with auditable sources,
    combined with insurer and training partnerships that create switching costs
    and provide recognized third-party validation of compliance.
