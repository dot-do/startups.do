  description: >-
    Constraint-aware finite scheduling across laser/punch, press brakes,
    hardware insertion, welding, and finishing.
  targetUsers:
    - Schedulers/Planners
    - Operations Managers
  triggers:
    - Daily schedule run
    - Rush order or downtime event
  inputs:
    - Work orders/routings
    - Setup/run times and changeover matrices
    - Machine calendars and labor shifts
    - Due dates/priority
    - Skills/certifications matrix
  steps:
    - Ingest ERP/MES data; validate routings and times.
    - >-
      Formulate CP-SAT model with precedence, machine/labor, setup, and due date
      constraints.
    - >-
      Optimize for on-time delivery, WIP, and setups; generate baseline
      schedule.
    - 'Run what-if scenarios (overtime, expedite, maintenance).'
    - 'Publish Gantt, dispatch lists, and KPIs; sync back to ERP.'
    - Monitor actuals; re-optimize on events.

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-based scheduling in high-mix, low-volume sheet metal
      shops cannot account for finite capacity and complex constraints (gauge
      changes, tooling, skilled operators, oven capacity, outsourced steps),
      resulting in firefighting and missed due dates.
    - >-
      Disjointed systems (ERP, nesting/CAM, machine controls) create data
      latency; schedule assumptions rarely match real-time machine states or
      material availability.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent setups and nesting-driven batching are not optimized
      end-to-end, inflating changeovers, WIP, and travel time between work
      centers.
    - >-
      Reactive rescheduling after disruptions (rush orders, breakdowns, sick
      leave) is slow (hours) and error-prone; dispatch on the floor drifts from
      the plan within a shift.
    - >-
      OTD and lead-time reliability are inconsistent (typical baseline 75–85%
      OTD), driving expediting, premium freight, and customer churn.
    - >-
      Generic ERP APS modules lack domain-specific heuristics for
      lasers/punches, press brakes, welding, finishing, leading to low adoption
      by planners and operators.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data model that links ERP jobs/routings, nesting batches, tooling,
      skills, and machine/oven capacities into a finite-capacity digital twin of
      the shop.
    - >-
      AI-powered APS engine (constraint programming + MILP + heuristics) that
      optimizes sequence-dependent setups (gauge, tooling families), batches
      nested parts, and respects material availability, skill matrices, and
      maintenance calendars.
    - >-
      Real-time dispatch boards for each work center with operator feedback
      loops; automatic re-optimization when disruptions occur (breakdowns, rush
      orders, no-shows).
    - >-
      What-if simulation and scenario comparison (e.g., add overtime, split
      lots, outsource a weld operation) with quantified OTD and cost impacts.
    - >-
      Machine connectivity (OPC UA/MTConnect/vendor APIs) for live status;
      connectors to ERP (ProShop, JobBOSS2/E2, Epicor) and nesting/CAM
      (SigmaNEST, Lantek, BySoft, TruTops, Amada).
    - >-
      Explainable scheduling (why-this-next) and change-impact analysis to build
      trust on the floor; role-based permissions and schedule locking by
      cell/shift.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook (6–8 weeks): data extraction/template mapping,
      time-study calibration, pilot cell go-live, whole-shop rollout, and ROI
      validation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Constraint-aware, finite scheduling purpose-built for sheet metal job-shops
    that plans your entire value stream (laser/punch → press brake → hardware →
    weld → finish) in minutes and re-plans in seconds—with explainable
    decisions—boosting OTD to 95%+, cutting changeovers 10–20%, and freeing
    planners 50–70% of their time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific APS with nesting-aware batching and press-brake setup
    optimization, pre-integrated with the most common sheet metal ERPs/CAMs,
    plus an explainable scheduling layer trusted by operators; accumulated
    calibration datasets and templates drastically shorten time-to-value
    compared with generic APS/ERP modules.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations leaders and schedulers at high-mix, low-volume sheet-metal job
    shops who need dependable promise dates, smooth flow, and fewer fires.
  problem: >-
    External: High-mix work, changeovers, and shifting priorities make
    spreadsheets fail; finite constraints across laser/punch, press brakes,
    hardware insertion, welding, and finishing are ignored. Internal: Constant
    firefighting, tribal scheduling knowledge, and no trustworthy view of
    capacity. Philosophical: A schedule should reflect reality, not wishful
    thinking—and everyone should be able to trust it.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the chaos of HMLV fabrication and know how nests,
    setups, tools, and skills collide with due dates. Authority: Built by
    manufacturing and optimization engineers; a constraint-aware finite
    scheduler that integrates with ERP/MES and CAD/CAM nesting; transparent
    logic that explains every decision.
  plan: >-
    - Connect data: sync jobs, routings, work centers, calendars, materials, and
    nests (laser/punch) from ERP/MES/CAD/CAM.

    - Configure constraints: capacities, setup/changeover matrices,
    tooling/fixture availability, operator skills and shifts, maintenance,
    buffers and transfer times, alternate routings/outsourcing.

    - Go live: generate a finite, dispatchable schedule and load board; run
    what-if scenarios; auto re-optimize when rush orders, breakdowns, or
    shortages hit.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a live demo and start a pilot on your data. Transitional: Send
    a recent backlog to receive a sample schedule and gap analysis.
  success: >-
    - Reliable promise dates and higher on-time delivery.

    - Lower WIP and shorter lead times with balanced machine and labor loads.

    - Fewer expedites and less overtime; clear, ranked dispatch lists for every
    cell.

    - End-to-end visibility from nest to brake to weld to finish, with
    dependency-aware sequencing.

    - Confidence: the schedule explains why each job is where it is.
  failure: |-
    - Missed due dates, rush fees, and unhappy customers.
    - Overtime, idle bottlenecks, and bloated WIP from guesswork.
    - Spreadsheet chaos when priorities change or a key scheduler is out.
    - Disconnected nesting and downstream cells causing starvation or blocking.
