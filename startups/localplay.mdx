  problem:
    - >-
      Independent hobby, toy, and game retailers struggle to keep Google
      Business Profile, website, and social channels consistently updated with
      local, timely content (events, arrivals, promos, holidays).
    - >-
      Manual content creation and posting takes 5–10 hours/week per store; most
      lack marketing staff and miss peak moments (new releases, holiday
      weekends, publisher events).
    - >-
      Inconsistent posting damages local SEO: lower Map Pack rankings, fewer GBP
      actions (calls, directions), and lost foot traffic.
    - >-
      Inventory and event data live in POS/calendars but aren’t translated into
      customer-facing content automatically.
    - >-
      Generic social tools don’t support GBP Posts, local SEO best practices, or
      inventory/event-driven templates; agencies are expensive and not
      vertically specialized.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI content engine that converts inventory feeds, event calendars, and
      promo schedules into localized, branded posts for GBP, website, Facebook,
      Instagram, and Twitter/X.
    - >-
      GBP-first local SEO workflow: auto-create Google Posts (What’s New,
      Offers, Events), add UTM tracking, insert local keywords, and schedule
      around peak search times.
    - >-
      Event autopublishing: create Facebook/Google events from store calendars
      (Melee.gg, EventLink, BCP) with RSVP/Waitlist links and cross-channel
      reminders.
    - >-
      New-arrival autoposts: detect new SKUs from POS (e.g., Pokémon restock)
      and create image+caption+price posts across channels with store pickup
      CTA.
    - >-
      Holiday/seasonal calendar per city/region with pre-approved templates
      (school breaks, paydays, gift guides).
    - >-
      Website sync: inject JSON-LD local business and event schema; auto-update
      a “What’s New”/“Events” page and homepage tiles.
    - >-
      Approval guardrails: default autopost with brand style; optional human
      approval queues and compliance filters (kid-safe imagery, ad copy).
    - >-
      Performance loop: auto A/B test creatives and cadences; re-boost top
      performers; learn store-specific best times and formats.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Set-and-forget local SEO autoposter for hobby, toy, and game stores: turn
    your POS inventory, events, and promos into Google, website, and social
    posts that drive foot traffic and sales—measured by calls, directions,
    RSVPs, and revenue.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization plus proprietary connectors (POS inventory + event
    platforms) and a growing performance dataset that optimizes local SEO
    posting cadences and creatives specifically for hobby/toy/game
    retail—difficult for generic social tools or agencies to replicate.
