leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      SKU-level demand is volatile and tied to housing/renovation cycles,
      promotions, and retailer resets; most plants forecast with spreadsheets
      and simple moving averages, causing 10–25% forecast bias and stockouts on
      A SKUs.
    - >-
      Changeovers (especially color/material) consume 10–20% of available
      machine time; schedules are often built manually, not optimized for
      mold/cavity constraints, leading to poor schedule attainment (<70%).
    - >-
      Machine, mold, and labor constraints aren’t jointly modeled; planners can
      meet demand in the plan but miss real-world feasibility, driving expedite
      freight and overtime.
    - >-
      Retailer and distributor service-level penalties (OTIF/On-Time to Request)
      erode margins; lack of DC-level demand visibility misallocates inventory.
    - >-
      Long-tail SKUs either overproduce (excess inventory/obsolescence) or
      underproduce (backorders), because ABC segmentation isn’t linked to
      planning policies (MOQ, min-run, safety stock).
    - >-
      ERP/MES data is siloed; POS/EDI signals and external indicators (housing
      starts, permits, weather) are not used in forecasting.
    - >-
      Thermoforming/injection operations need campaign planning (e.g.,
      light-to-dark color sequences) to cut purge/scrap; planners lack tools to
      enforce optimal sequences.
    - >-
      Maintenance windows and mold PM aren’t integrated into the MPS, causing
      unplanned downtime and missed schedules.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting: hierarchical SKU x customer/region weekly forecasts
      using orders, POS/EDI, promotions, external indicators (housing starts,
      permits, weather), with bias control and ABC policy tuning.
    - >-
      Constraint-based master production scheduling (MPS): MILP/CP-SAT optimizer
      models machines, molds/cavities, cycle times, crew/labor, setup and
      color-sequencing, maintenance windows, MOQs/min-run/lot sizes, and
      material availability to produce a feasible weekly schedule by line/shift.
    - >-
      Color campaign planning: light-to-dark sequencing and family batching to
      minimize purges, resin loss, and setup time.
    - >-
      Service-level aware planning: balances OTIF targets and cost-to-serve,
      with DC-level allocation and prioritization rules for retail/commercial
      channels.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if simulations for promotions, price changes,
      capacity outages, or resin constraints; compare KPI deltas before
      committing the MPS.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: ERP/MES connectors to publish planned orders, track
      schedule adherence, and auto-retrain forecasts with latest signals.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment: 8–12 week implementation, data agents for on-prem
      ERP/MES, SOC 2-ready security, and planner-friendly UI with explainable
      forecasts and plan rationales.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Improve service and throughput while cutting changeovers: SKU-level demand
    forecasts + constraint-based weekly MPS tailored to injection/thermoforming.
    Target outcomes in 90 days: +3–5 OEE points, +5–10 pts schedule attainment
    (to 85–95%), -15–25% changeover hours, -20–30% expedite freight, +2–4 pts
    fill rate, -10–20% finished goods inventory on A/B SKUs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A constraint and color-campaign optimizer purpose-built for plastics
    plumbing (mold/cavity, purge costs, retailer calendars) with pre-built
    ERP/MES/EDI connectors and external housing indicators, enabling sub-12-week
    deployments and measurable KPI guarantees; growing benchmark dataset for
    326191 strengthens models over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, plant, and production planning leaders at plastics plumbing
    fixture manufacturers (NAICS 326191) who need reliable SKU-level forecasts
    and a feasible weekly master schedule for injection/thermoforming lines to
    hit OTIF while minimizing changeovers, overtime, and excess inventory.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile distributor orders, seasonality and promos, long-tail
    SKUs, resin/color constraints, limited molds and machine tonnage, labor
    gaps, and maintenance windows make schedules fragile. Internal: Planners
    live in spreadsheets, firefight shortages, and lack confidence in the plan.
    Philosophical: Moving water shouldn’t require guesswork—production should
    run predictably and profitably.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the chaos of tool swaps, resin changeovers, and late
    distributor pulls. Authority: Purpose-built AI for injection/thermoforming
    with finite-capacity scheduling, changeover matrices, and campaign logic.
    Proven integrations (SAP, Infor, Epicor), secure data handling, and
    measurable improvements across similar discrete manufacturers.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & model: Ingest ERP/MES/CRM data; map SKUs, routings, molds,
    cavitation, machine/tonnage, resin/colors, changeover times, min lots,
    maintenance, crews, and storage. 2) Calibrate: Train demand models
    (seasonality, promotions, lead times) and a finite scheduler to
    service-level targets; run what-if simulations and validate with planners.
    3) Operate: Deliver weekly SKU forecasts and a constrained master schedule
    with planner overrides, alerts, and KPI tracking; continuously tune models
    as signals change. Risk reduction: 6–8 week pilot, no rip-and-replace, keep
    planner control, clear ROI checkpoints.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute discovery to scope your pilot. Transitional: Get a
    sample forecast and constrained schedule using your historical data, plus a
    readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - 20–40% lower forecast error at SKU level. - 15–30% less finished-goods and
    WIP inventory with maintained or higher service. - 95–99% customer
    service/OTIF with fewer expedites. - 10–25% fewer changeovers via smart
    campaigns and color sequencing. - 10–20% less overtime and 20–40% fewer
    premium freight events. - Higher schedule adherence (85–95%) and more stable
    crews. - Clear visibility to resin/tool constraints and proactive capacity
    planning.
  failure: >-
    Without this, planners keep firefighting: stockouts and late orders, costly
    expediting, whiplash schedules, idle machines next to bottlenecks, bloated
    inventory that still misses demand, frustrated distributors, and margin
    erosion that invites competitors into key accounts.

  problem:
    - Volatile SKU-level demand makes manual forecasting unreliable.
    - Changeovers (color/resin/mold) consume capacity and create scrap.
    - Spreadsheets and tribal scheduling cause stockouts and overtime.
    - >-
      Press tonnage–mold compatibility and cavitation constraints are hard to
      juggle.
    - Thermoforming bottlenecks at forming/trim stations derail plans.
    - Tooling calendars and maintenance windows disrupt schedules.
    - Resin availability and lead times force last‑minute expedites.
    - Missed OTIF and rush fees erode margins.
  solution:
    - 'Machine‑learning forecasts at SKU, plant, and customer/DC levels.'
    - >-
      Constrained weekly MPS for injection and thermoforming that respects press
      capacity, tonnage–mold matrix, cavitation, cycle times, and labor shifts.
    - Auto‑sequencing to minimize color/material purges and mold changeovers.
    - 'Built‑in tooling calendars, maintenance, and mold‑sharing constraints.'
    - >-

    - New SKU forecasts via attribute/family analogs.
    - Service‑level targets (fill rate/OTIF) with safety stock optimization.
    - >-
      Capacity models for injection presses and thermoforming lines: tonnage,
      mold compatibility, cavities, cycle time, scrap.
    - Family molds and shared tooling scheduling.
    - Color/material‑aware sequencing to cut purge time and waste.
    - >-
      Resin allocation and availability checks, including regrind/blend

  steps:
    - >-
      Connect ERP/MES data: orders, BOMs, routings, inventory, tooling, and
      calendars.
    - Load press/line specs and mold–press compatibility matrix.
    - Auto‑generate baseline SKU forecasts; planners review and adjust.
    - >-
      Create the first constrained weekly MPS; auto‑sequence
      injection/thermoforming runs.
