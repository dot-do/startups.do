leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Price opacity and fragmentation: skippers rely on phone calls, text
      threads, and social media to gauge dealer/auction prices, which are
      incomplete and delayed.
    - >-
      Landing choices often ignore full net economics: travel time, fuel burn,
      crew shares, ice/bait costs, dealer cutoffs, queue times, and expected
      grade losses are not systematically considered.
    - >-
      Freshness and grade decay under time/temperature constraints can erase the
      benefit of chasing higher headline prices.
    - >-
      Regulatory, quota, and dealer eligibility constraints (licenses, trip
      limits, landing ports, reporting windows) are complex and change by
      season/area/species.
    - >-
      Price volatility within and across ports creates risk of downgrades,
      returns, or low-ball offers upon arrival.
    - >-
      Captains lack tools that work offline/low-bandwidth and integrate
      weather/tide/ETA for realistic decision support.
    - >-
      Dealers/auctions want predictable landings and quality but lack
      forecasting of inbound volume without breaching competitors’
      confidentiality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate and normalize dealer/auction ex-vessel prices (by species,
      size/grade, landing conditions) via APIs, secure dealer portals,
      SMS/uplink forms, and human verification; timestamp and quality-score each
      quote.
    - >-
      Predictive price and demand modeling by port/dealer using seasonality,
      weather, historical landings, quotas, and market signals; provide
      confidence intervals and price latency indicators.
    - >-
      Freshness/grade decay modeling by species based on time-temperature
      profile, soak time, hold conditions, and handling practices to estimate
      expected grade on arrival.
    - >-
      Constrained route and landing optimizer that maximizes expected net
      revenue after fuel, time, grade decay, queue risk, and dealer cutoffs;
      returns top 3 options with explanations.
    - >-
      Compliance and eligibility filters (licenses, quota, trip limits, VMS/ER
      log requirements); only recommends legal options and attaches required
      reporting steps.
    - >-
      ETA engine integrating tide, weather, and vessel performance;
      offline-first mobile app with low-bandwidth updates via satellite; syncs
      when connectivity is available.
    - >-
      Dealer-side tools to publish price ranges, capacity windows, and
      preferences; opt-in forecasts of inbound volume with confidentiality
      controls (aggregation/anonymization).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase ex-vessel net revenue per trip by 3–7% within freshness, weather,
    and regulatory limits by unifying dealer/auction prices and optimizing
    where/when to land. Clear, auditable recommendations with offline-first
    tools for captains and fleet dashboards for managers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A dealer-backed, confidentiality-preserving price network combined with
    species-specific freshness/grade decay and a constrained landing optimizer,
    delivered in an offline-first captain workflow. Exclusive price/capacity
    agreements with key dealers/auctions, validated uplift case studies, and
    trust built through performance-based pilots create a defensible data and
    relationship moat.

  character: >-
    Shellfish skippers and fleet managers who must decide where and when to land
    to maximize net revenue within freshness and travel limits.
  problem: >-
    - External: Dealer/auction prices swing by port and hour; fuel and steaming
    time cut margins; tides, quotas, and freshness windows limit options.

    - Internal: Guesswork creates stress and second-guessing; no one wants to
    steam past the best price.

    - Philosophical: Hard-won catch deserves a fair, data-driven price—not
    rumors or luck.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know every hour at sea and every mile steamed matters, and
    stale price info costs you real money.

    - Authority: Live consolidated dealer/auction prices, historical trends, AI
    route and freshness modeling, and proven pilots with working fleets.
  plan: |-
    - Process:
      1) Connect target species, home ports, cost/freshness limits, and preferred dealers.
      2) Receive ranked landing recommendations by port and ETA with net revenue forecasts and fuel/time trade-offs.
      3) Get alerts as prices move; land with confidence; review trip outcomes to improve next time.
    - Agreement:
      - Transparent pricing, your data stays yours, offline-ready onboard app, and support from setup through your first landings.

    - Direct: Book a 14-day pilot and get your first optimized landings this
    month.

    - Transitional: Get a sample price report, weekly port heatmap, and ROI
    calculator.
  success: |-
    - Higher net revenue per trip and per pound.
    - Less wasted steaming and fuel.
    - Fewer missed peak-price windows and freshness penalties.
    - Better dealer relationships and predictable cash flow.
    - Confidence in every landing decision.
  failure: |-
    - Leaving money on the table by landing at the wrong port or time.
    - Spoilage deductions and late arrivals.
    - Burning fuel on guesswork and stressing crews.
    - Living at the mercy of rumors instead of real-time market data.
