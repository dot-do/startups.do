  problem:
    - >-
      Manual cut order planning takes 1–6 hours per PO and depends on a few
      experts using spreadsheets, causing bottlenecks and variability.
    - >-
      Suboptimal roll allocation and marker-to-lay translation typically waste
      0.5–2.0% of fabric and create large remnants that are hard to reuse.
    - >-
      Shade management is error-prone; mixing shades leads to quality defects or
      rework, while over-conservative grouping reduces utilization.
    - >-
      Frequent re-plans are needed when fabric rolls arrive late, are short, or
      fail QC/shrinkage tests; re-planning is slow and disrupts cutting
      schedules.
    - >-
      Disconnected systems (ERP/PLM, fabric inventory, CAD/marker libraries,
      cutting/spreading equipment) cause data errors and delays.
    - >-
      Cut rooms struggle to align lays/lots with sewing line size ratios and
      delivery dates, causing WIP imbalances and late orders.
    - >-
      KPIs (fabric utilization, remnant ratio, plan adherence) are not measured
      consistently, making continuous improvement difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingest: Pull POs, style-size-color ratios, markers, fabric roll
      inventory (length, width, shade, shrinkage), capacity (tables, cutters,
      spreaders), due dates.
    - >-
      Optimization engine: Multi-objective solver that 1) allocates rolls by
      shade and width, 2) builds lays/lots honoring table lengths, ply limits,
      shrinkage, and size ratios, 3) minimizes remnants and changeovers, 4)
      aligns with delivery priorities.
    - >-
      Executable outputs: Lay plans, lot/bundle tickets with barcodes/RFID,
      roll-pull lists by shade/width, spread/cut instructions compatible with
      CAD/CAM systems.
    - >-
      Dynamic re-planning: Auto-replans when rolls arrive/are short, QC results
      update, or priorities shift; proposes minimal-disruption changes.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: Compare plans across objectives (max utilization vs.
      due-date risk) with clear KPIs before committing.
    - >-
      Closed-loop KPIs: Tracks fabric utilization, remnant profile, plan
      adherence, re-cut rate, and planner time saved; exports to BI dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate shade-correct, capacity-feasible cut plans in minutes—not
    hours—optimizing roll allocation to maximize fabric utilization and minimize
    remnants, with measurable 0.5–1.5% fabric savings and faster, more reliable
    cutting room execution. Integrates with existing ERP, CAD/marker, and
    cutting equipment to deliver ROI in 4–8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned optimization engine that jointly optimizes shade-correct roll
    allocation, lay planning, and remnant reuse with proven savings benchmarks;
    a growing dataset of real cut outcomes that improves recommendations; and a
    pre-built integration library to major ERP/CAD/CAM systems that shortens
    time-to-value. Early design-partner case studies and optional gain-share
    pricing lower buyer risk and create defensible references.

  callToAction: Book a demo or start a two-week pilot with your live POs and roll data
  success: >-
    Plan in minutes not hours, boost fabric yield 1-3%, cut remnants up to 50%,
    eliminate shade mismatches, stabilize lead times, and gain traceability from
    roll to bundle
