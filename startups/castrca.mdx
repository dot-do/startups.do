leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap and rework rates of 5–20% are common in aluminum, magnesium, and
      zinc die casting; root causes are multi-factor and vary by die, alloy, and
      machine.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge driven; engineers
      manually sift PLC/shot profiles, die lube logs, and quality records,
      delaying fixes by days to weeks.
    - >-
      Setpoint windows are static and not tied to changing conditions (die
      temperature, die age, vacuum health, ambient conditions), causing drift
      and unstable Cpk.
    - >-
      Process data is siloed (machine/PLC, shot monitoring, vacuum, lube,
      X-ray/CT, leak test, SPC/QMS, MES/ERP); correlations to defects are weak
      or non-existent.
    - >-
      New die launches and engineering changes suffer long stabilization
      periods; FPY and PPAP timelines slip due to unknown drivers of porosity,
      cold shuts, soldering, flash, and dimensional defects.
    - >-
      Operators lack actionable, explainable guidance; alerts are
      threshold-based, not multivariate; countermeasures are inconsistent
      between shifts.
    - >-
      Maintenance and die-life decisions are reactive; die wear and vacuum
      system degradation are detected only after scrap spikes.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks real-time ROI visibility on improvement actions; savings
      attribution and setpoint adherence are not measured.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud data pipeline: ingest high-frequency shot profiles and
      contextual data via OPC UA/MQTT and historians (Ignition, OSIsoft PI);
      join with QMS/MES defect labels and test results.
    - >-
      Automated feature engineering for die casting: decompose shot profiles
      (phase velocities, fill time, biscuit thickness, intensification pressure,
      vacuum timing), thermal cycles, spray/lube patterns, and
      environmental/shift context.
    - >-
      Explainable ML models per die/alloy/machine to rank top drivers
      (SHAP/feature attribution) and predict defect risk pre- and post-shot;
      update models with drift detection.
    - >-
      Dynamic setpoint window optimization that maximizes FPY subject to Cpk and
      cycle-time constraints; recommendations rendered to operators and
      engineers with severity and confidence.
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflows: trial planning (A/B), electronic sign-off, and
      setpoint adherence monitoring; integrate outcomes to PPAP/control plan
      documentation.
    - >-
      Role-based dashboards: real-time scrap map, driver analysis, die health
      index, vacuum effectiveness, lube impact, and savings attribution.
    - >-
      Change management and coaching playbooks tailored for foundries; optional
      managed service to accelerate improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap 20–40% and stabilize FPY in 90 days by correlating multivariate
    process data to defect outcomes, explaining top drivers, and recommending
    dynamic, die-specific setpoint windows with measurable ROI and audit-ready
    traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built die-casting analytics stack combining a curated defect
    ontology, pre-trained feature library for shot profiles, and dynamic
    setpoint optimization—delivered with OEM-grade connectors and explainable
    recommendations that tie directly into PPAP/control-plan workflows. Early
    deployments create a proprietary cross-die benchmark library that
    accelerates new sites and improves accuracy beyond generic IIoT analytics.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Foundry managers and process/quality engineers at nonferrous die‑casting
    plants (NAICS 331523) who want to cut scrap, stabilize processes, and ship
    defect‑free castings on time and at target cost.
  problem: >-
    External: scrap, leaks, and rework driven by hundreds of shifting variables
    and siloed data. Internal: constant firefighting and pressure to hit
    OEE/PPAP. Philosophical: plant data should make every shot predictable—not
    rely on tribal knowledge.
  guide: >-
    We understand thin margins and the pain of chasing porosity, cold shuts, and
    leaks. Built by metallurgists and data scientists, our Scrap and Defect
    Root‑Cause Analyzer correlates process data to defect outcomes to rank true
    drivers and recommend setpoint windows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect press, furnace, die‑thermal, and quality/MES data. 2) Analyze to
    pinpoint top defect drivers and optimal setpoint windows with alerts. 3)
    Act: pilot on one cell, standardize limits, and sustain with weekly
    reviews—IT‑safe (on‑prem or VPC), no PLC writes, you own the data.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30‑minute fit call or start a 30‑day pilot on one cell.
    Transitional: download the Defect‑Driver Playbook and ROI calculator, and
    request a sample report.
  success: >-
    Lower scrap and rework, higher FPY and uptime, faster PPAPs and launches,
    confident setpoints, captured know‑how, and happier customers with rapid
    payback.
  failure: >-
    Without action: persistent scrap and leaks, missed OEE and deliveries,
    chargebacks and returns, operator blame cycles, and loss of expertise as
    veterans retire.
