  problem:
    - >-
      Most apparel brands rely on generic, batch-and-blast campaigns; only 8–15%
      of revenue comes from automated lifecycle flows vs. 20–35% for
      best-in-class, leaving revenue on the table.
    - >-
      Manual segmentation and flow building take weeks; small teams (1–3
      marketers) can’t keep up with SKUs, seasons, and promotions, so flows go
      stale.
    - >-
      Existing ESP/SMS tools have basic AI but not apparel-specific
      (style/size/color/seasonality), leading to irrelevant recommendations and
      higher unsubscribes.
    - >-
      Measuring true incremental lift is hard; few brands run proper holdouts,
      so they can’t prove ROI or optimize frequency/creative.
    - >-
      SMS compliance (TCPA), quiet hours, and cross-channel frequency capping
      are tedious and error-prone, risking fines and churn.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation (Shopify/ERP/ESP/SMS/reviews) makes building effective
      segments and triggers difficult without a data team.
    - >-
      Content creation bottleneck: on-brand copy and product blocks for multiple
      segments/channels/tests overwhelm creative teams.
  solution:
    - >-
      1-click integrations (Shopify/Shopify Plus, Klaviyo, Attentive,
      Postscript) to ingest orders, browsing, catalog, variants, discounts, and
      messaging data.
    - >-
      Auto-segmentation purpose-built for apparel: style affinity, size/fit
      preferences, color palettes, price sensitivity, new vs. repeat, churn
      risk, discount affinity, RFM tiers.
    - >-
      Auto-generated flows: welcome, browse/product/cart abandonment,
      post-purchase, cross-sell/upsell, replenishment (basics), win-back,
      VIP/loyalty, back-in-stock, price-drop.
    - >-
      Apparel-aware recommendations: dynamic product blocks by style/size
      in-stock, outfit bundling, seasonal swaps, new arrival recency weighting.
    - >-
      Brand-safe content generation: on-brand voice cloning, regional spelling,
      compliance templates, image captions; human-in-the-loop approvals and
      versioning.
    - >-
      Experimentation baked in: A/B/n for subject lines, send-time, creative;
      multi-armed bandit for winners; holdout groups for true incremental
      revenue measurement.
    - >-
      Frequency and channel governance: quiet hours, fatigue scoring,
      cross-channel capping, automatic SMS/email arbitration per user.
    - >-
      Deliverability and compliance guardrails: list hygiene, sunset policies,
      consent syncing, TCPA/GDPR/CCPA workflows, data deletion API.
    - >-
      Performance analytics: revenue per recipient, flow revenue share, LTV
      impact, CAC payback, incrementality dashboards, SKU/segment cohort
      reporting.
    - >-
      Agency and multi-store features: templates, cloning, workspace
      permissions, shared benchmarks across portfolios.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Ship apparel-optimized email/SMS flows in 1 day that lift flow-attributed
    revenue 10–25%, cut unsubscribes 8–12%, and prove ROI with automated
    holdouts—without adding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and templates trained on apparel signals
    (style/size/color/seasonality) plus a growing benchmark dataset create
    higher relevance with lower churn; one-day ROI proof via automated holdouts
    and push-button flows reduces time-to-value competitors can’t match.
