leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Late-stage DFM issues (draft, wall thickness, undercuts, gating) drive
      tool rework and engineering change orders (ECOs), adding 2–6 weeks lead
      time and $10k–$50k per program.
    - >-
      Side-actions and unnecessary lifters add $3k–$15k per mold cavity and
      increase maintenance complexity.
    - >-
      Manual DFM reviews depend on scarce senior tooling engineers; throughput
      is limited (1–3 days/part) and subjective across reviewers.
    - >-
      General-purpose simulation tools (e.g., Moldflow) are powerful but too
      slow and costly for early design iteration; many teams skip early checks,
      discovering issues after tool kick-off.
    - >-
      Poor gate selection leads to weld lines, cosmetic defects, and internal
      stresses; first-shot scrap rates of 5–15% are common on complex aesthetic
      parts.
    - >-
      Inconsistent design rules across teams lead to variability and compliance
      risk (e.g., thin regions at threaded or sealing features causing
      leaks/fail).
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows (CAD → email → PDF markups) cause context loss and
      rework; no system-level visibility to recurring issues across part
      families.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated CAD ingestion and geometric analysis for draft angles, uniform
      wall thickness mapping, ribs/bosses, undercuts, and side-action count
      estimation.
    - >-
      AI gating recommender (gate type, location, and size) optimized for
      aesthetic faces, water-tight features, and flow balance typical of
      plumbing fixtures.
    - >-
      Rapid “moldflow-lite” heuristics/ML to predict weld line, sink, and
      warpage risk in minutes (not hours) for early iteration.
    - >-
      Parting line suggestions with alternative configurations to minimize
      slides and reduce tool cost/complexity.
    - >-
      Annotated 3D report (heat maps and callouts) exportable to STEP/PDF and
      embeddable in PDM/PLM with tracked resolutions.
    - >-
      Material-aware rules (ABS, PP, PVC, POM, PBT blends) with default
      templates common in fixtures; includes thread and O-ring groove design
      checks.
    - >-
      Portfolio analytics to identify recurring DFM violations across product
      families, enabling training and rule tightening.
    - >-
      Secure by design: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML, data regions,
      on-prem/air-gapped option for sensitive programs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop premium review option with partner tooling engineers for
      critical A-surface parts.
    - >-
      APIs and CAD plug-ins (SolidWorks/Inventor/NX/Onshape) for in-environment
      checks and automated pre-check on every CAD release.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10-minute, plumbing-fixture–specific AI DFM that flags manufacturability
    risks and recommends gating/parting strategies directly inside your CAD
    workflow—cutting ECOs by ~30%, reducing side-actions by ~20%, and saving
    $50k+ per program while accelerating tool kick-off.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A plumbing-fixture–specific DFM knowledge base and proprietary dataset
    sourced from partner molders/tool shops (linking CAD features to real
    production outcomes), enabling higher-accuracy gating/parting
    recommendations than generalist tools; reinforced by in-CAD workflow, PLM
    integration, and continuous learning from aggregated issue-resolution data.
