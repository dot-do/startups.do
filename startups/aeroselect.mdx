  problem:
    - >-
      Application engineers spend 30–90 minutes per inquiry to locate the right
      fan/blower using disparate Excel tools, PDFs, and legacy selection
      software, slowing quote cycles and causing backlog.
    - >-
      Selections are inconsistent across regions and teams, causing rework,
      warranty claims, and margin erosion when duty point, temperature,
      altitude, gas composition, or sound constraints are overlooked.
    - >-
      Standards and compliance (AMCA 210/300/301, ISO 5801/3744, ATEX, NFPA
      68/69) are complex and frequently updated; knowledge is locked in senior
      SMEs and not uniformly applied.
    - >-
      Sales teams need customer-facing reports quickly (submittals, sound and
      performance data, electrical specs). Generating and formatting these
      reports takes hours per quote.
    - >-
      Existing OEM-specific tools are not conversational, have steep learning
      curves, are siloed per brand/catalog, and rarely integrate with
      CPQ/ERP/CRM, leading to duplicate data entry and errors.
    - >-
      Distributors, reps, and MEP consultants need fast, explainable
      pre-selections but lack access to OEM engineering tools or the expertise
      to use them correctly.
  solution:
    - >-
      RAG-powered conversational assistant ingesting OEM catalogs, performance
      curves, fan laws, noise data, materials, coatings, electrical options, and
      compliance rules to recommend models meeting duty point, sound,
      environment, and standards.
    - >-
      Deterministic selection core (solver) behind the LLM: curve interpolation,
      fan laws scaling, air density corrections (temperature/altitude/moisture),
      system effect factors, and sound summation per AMCA 300/301; LLM explains
      and orchestrates but does not guess numbers.
    - >-
      Compliance reasoning: checks selections against AMCA/ISO, ATEX zoning,
      NFPA 68/69 safety, spark-resistant construction, motor enclosure
      requirements, and documents assumptions.
    - >-
      Report exports: branded selection sheets, submittals, sound reports
      (dBA/NC/NR), BOM, energy estimates, and quote packages in
      PDF/Excel/CSV/Revit family metadata.
    - >-
      Integrations: CPQ (pricing/configuration), ERP (lead-time/availability),
      PLM/PDM (BOM/option rules), CRM (opportunity), and legacy selection tools
      via connectors.
    - >-
      Multi-catalog support: search across families and brands with
      permissioning, enabling rep networks to pre-select while OEM engineering
      remains final approver (human-in-the-loop).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From duty point to AMCA-compliant selection and quote in minutes, not days.
    A conversational, explainable assistant that unifies your catalogs, curves,
    standards, and pricing to deliver accurate, auditable selections and
    export-ready submittals—integrated with your CPQ/ERP/CRM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific selection engine tightly coupled with a standards-aware
    knowledge graph and a library of OEM connectors to legacy tools, producing
    explainable, auditable outputs. Over time, a unique, anonymized benchmark
    dataset of selection outcomes and field performance enables better ranking,
    noise prediction, and energy estimates than general-purpose AI or generic
    CPQ solutions. Early alignment with AMCA and validation data from partner
    labs raises switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Sales and application engineers at industrial/commercial fan, blower, and
    air purification manufacturers—plus their reps and distributors—who need
    fast, accurate, standards-compliant selections and submittals.
  problem: >-
    External: Selecting the right model for a duty point while meeting noise,
    environment, and standards is slow, error-prone, and scattered across PDFs
    and tribal knowledge. Internal: Teams feel pressure to respond to RFQs in
    minutes and worry about misselections, rework, and warranty risk.
    Philosophical: Engineering choices should be data-backed and effortless, not
    bottlenecked by fragmented tools.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the spec-sheet shuffle, late recalcs, and the stress of
    hitting performance and acoustics on the first pass. Authority: Built by
    mechanical/HVAC engineers; a conversational, RAG-powered assistant grounded
    in your catalog, curves, noise data, and relevant standards (e.g.,
    AMCA/ISO/ASHRAE); validated on real-world selections and reporting
    workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: Securely ingest your catalog, performance curves, sound
    power tables, materials/ratings, and applicable standards into the RAG
    index. 2) Converse to select: State duty point and constraints (flow,
    pressure, noise limits, temperature, corrosives, certifications); receive
    ranked models with curves, sound, materials, and compliance notes. 3)
    Approve and export: Generate selection reports, submittals, BIM/specs, and
    pricing handoffs; log decisions and push to CRM/ERP/CPQ.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14‑day pilot with your catalog. Transitional: Book a
    20‑minute demo; try the sandbox with sample data; download a sample
    selection report.
  success: >-
    Respond to RFQs in minutes; higher win rates; fewer misselections and
    returns; consistent, audit-ready reports; enforced standards and best
    practices; faster onboarding for new reps; 24/7 support for global teams;
    seamless handoff to CPQ and operations.
  failure: >-
    Slow, inconsistent selections; missed specs or non-compliance; costly rework
    and warranty exposure; lost bids due to delays; knowledge loss when experts
    are unavailable; fragmented, non-traceable decisions.
