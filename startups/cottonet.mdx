  problem:
    - >-
      Irrigated cotton faces high variability in crop water demand due to
      weather, soil, and growth stage, leading to over- or under-irrigation that
      reduces lint yield and profitability.
    - >-
      Manual scheduling is time-consuming and error-prone across multiple
      pivots/fields; growers lack actionable, field-level ET insights translated
      into run-time instructions.
    - >-
      Rising pumping energy costs ($10–$60 per acre-inch depending on lift and
      fuel) and tightening water constraints make inefficient irrigation
      financially and operationally risky.
    - >-
      Existing tools often require expensive hardware (soil moisture sensors)
      with inconsistent ROI or are not tuned for cotton-specific phenology and
      management.
    - >-
      Compliance and incentives (NRCS EQIP Irrigation Water Management) require
      documentation most farms struggle to produce without digital records.
    - >-
      Labor shortages and the need to coordinate irrigations with weather events
      (e.g., rain forecasts) cause missed or unnecessary irrigations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Field-level ET estimation: fuse gridded reference ETo (local stations)
      with satellite-driven crop coefficients (NDVI-based Kc), tuned for cotton
      growth stages and regional conditions.
    - >-
      Weekly irrigation schedules with pivot runtime translation by system type
      (center pivot, SDI, furrow), nozzle package, application efficiency, and
      pump capacity.
    - >-
      Dynamic adjustments for recent rainfall, forecasted precipitation, heat
      events, and soil water balance (rooting depth, soil-available water).
    - >-
      Proactive alerts: hold/skip irrigation if rain probability and amount
      exceed thresholds; increase irrigation during heat stress windows;
      frost/end-of-season cutbacks.
    - >-
      Optional integrations: soil moisture sensors, pump run-time telemetry, and
      pivot control platforms (read/write where allowed).
    - >-
      Compliance reporting: automated season logs (applied vs. ETc), water
      saved, kWh/fuel saved, and documentation to support NRCS EQIP Irrigation
      Water Management.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hands-off, field-level irrigation schedules for cotton that save 15–25%
    water and 5–10% energy while maintaining or increasing yield (1–3%+),
    without installing sensors. Weekly pivot run-times and alerts derived from
    cotton-tuned ET/AI, delivered via app/SMS, with compliance-ready reports and
    a pay-for-performance guarantee.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cotton growers and irrigation managers (NAICS 111920) who want reliable
    yields, lower water/energy costs, and field-level irrigation decisions
    without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather swings, variable soils, and complex pivot/furrow sets make
    irrigation timing hard. Internal: Uncertainty and time pressure create
    stress and rework. Philosophical: Watering cotton should be precise and
    simple—no one should need to be a data scientist to irrigate right.
  guide: >-
    We know every watering window matters. Our ET-based AI uses local weather
    and remote sensing to compute field-level crop water use and deliver weekly
    schedules and alerts—backed by agronomy/hydrology expertise and validated in
    Cotton Belt trials.
  plan: >-
    1) Enroll fields and irrigation method. 2) Set planting date/soil and
    connect weather. 3) Receive weekly schedules and alerts, log irrigations,
    and let the system auto-adjust.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free field trial or book a 15-minute demo; download a sample weekly
    schedule and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Confident, timely irrigations; measurable water and pumping cost savings;
    protected boll set and fiber quality; steady yields with fewer passes and
    easier compliance—peace of mind all season.
  failure: >-
    Without it, you risk over- or under-watering, wasted energy, plant stress,
    lost yield, micronaire issues, and missed irrigation windows.
