  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers waste 2–6 minutes per SKU writing titles, bullets, and
      descriptions; at 20,000 SKUs that’s 667–2,000 labor hours per season.
    - >-
      Product pages lack consistent fabric, care, and fit attributes, leading to
      higher returns and lower customer trust.
    - >-
      Duplicate or thin content across variants hurts organic rankings and
      marketplace discoverability.
    - >-
      Manual alt text and meta tags are rarely produced at scale, harming
      accessibility and SEO click-through rates.
    - >-
      Global expansion is slowed by the effort to localize copy and comply with
      labeling rules (e.g., EU textile labeling, FTC fiber rules).
    - >-
      Marketplace rules (Amazon, Zalando, Walmart) on titles, attributes, and
      character limits change often; non-compliance leads to suppressed
      listings.
    - >-
      Brand voice inconsistencies across thousands of SKUs reduce conversion and
      dilute brand equity.
    - >-
      SEO teams struggle to perform keyword research at the category/SKU level
      and connect it to product content systematically.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest catalog data from PIM/e-commerce via API/CSV and analyze images to
      detect patterns, colors, and details.
    - >-
      Generate SEO titles, bullets, long/short descriptions, meta
      titles/descriptions, alt text, and structured data (JSON-LD) per
      SKU/variant.
    - >-
      Extract and normalize fabric composition and care instructions using NER +
      rules aligned to FTC and EU textile regulations; map to GINETEX/ISO care
      symbols.
    - >-
      Variant-aware content that avoids duplicate text while maintaining brand
      voice and SEO requirements; automatic canonicalization and deduping.
    - >-
      Category-level keyword discovery and clustering; content templates that
      respect marketplace and brand character limits and formatting rules.
    - >-
      Multi-language generation and localization (e.g., EN, ES, FR, DE, IT) with
      regional compliance checks and unit conversions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflows: approvals, redlines, brand voice learning,
      and QA checks (grammar, toxicity, claims).
    - >-
      Bulk export and syndication to Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, Salsify,
      Akeneo, and marketplaces; webhook-based updates on price/stock-driven
      changes.
    - >-
      A/B testing and analytics measuring acceptance rate, edit rate, SEO
      rankings, CTR, and conversion impact.
    - >-
      Guardrails: prohibited claims filters, age-appropriateness checks, and
      materials safety notes where applicable.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    conversion with measurable uplift.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
