    and correlates with process windows to recommend countermeasures.
  targetUsers:
    - Quality engineers
    - Met lab
    - Production managers

  problem:
    - >-
      Inline surface defects (seams, laps, die lines, zinc pickup) drive
      scrap/rework, customer returns, and lost throughput; detection is often
      late (post-coil or downstream), making root-cause isolation expensive and
      slow.
    - >-
      Existing vision systems flag defects but do not reliably classify by
      defect family or correlate to process windows (reduction per die, speed,
      lube, die wear, bath chemistry), so corrective actions are
      trial-and-error.
    - >-
      Process and quality data are siloed (PLC/SCADA/MES/LIMS/ERP), preventing
      continuous learning across coils, lots, and lines; tribal knowledge
      retires with experts.
    - >-
      Operators face alarm fatigue and false positives from generic vision
      tools, reducing trust and adoption; quality teams spend hours compiling 8D
      reports manually.
    - >-
      Wire drawing/galkanizing lines run at high speed (5–35 m/s) with tight
      margins; even small mis-sets (e.g., 5°C bath temp drift, 0.5% Al
      variation, 2% speed increase) can double defect rates.
    - >-
      Plants lack an ROI-justified, steel-wire-specific solution that closes the
      loop from detection to prescriptive countermeasures and verifies
      effectiveness.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy high-speed line-side vision (line-scan/area-scan + tailored
      lighting) to capture surface at 360° coverage; edge inference classifies
      seams, laps, die lines, zinc pickup, pitting, scratches in real time.
    - >-
      Ingest synchronized process data (die stack, reduction schedule, capstan
      speed/torque, drawing force, lube pressure/temperature/concentration,
      pickling/anneal parameters, bath temp/Al, air-wipe settings) via OPC
      UA/Modbus/SQL and build a genealogy across heat/rod/coil/line.
    - >-
      Correlate defect rates and morphologies to process windows using
      multivariate time-series modeling (Granger causality, SHAP feature
      attribution, change-point detection) to identify likely root causes and
      drift.
    - >-
      Prescriptive countermeasures engine maps defect-class + context to
      recommended actions (e.g., replace die N, reduce reduction at die 3 by
      2–3%, increase lube concentration by 1–2%, adjust bath Al by 0.05–0.1%,
      increase air-wipe pressure by 5–10 kPa).
    - >-
      Operator-centric workflow: prioritized alerts, one-click 8D report
      generation, before/after verification of fixes, SPC charts, and what-if
      simulation for process-window changes.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement: federated learning by plant/line with strict data
      governance; recurring model re-training validated against golden datasets;
      KPI tracking ROI dashboards.
    - >-
      Integration with MES/ERP for hold/release, COA attachment of defect
      analytics, and maintenance CMMS for die life prediction and planned
      changeovers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production and quality leaders in steel wire drawing (NAICS 331222) who want
    to eliminate surface defects, stabilize process windows, and lift yield with
    predictable throughput.
  problem: >-
    External: Recurring surface defects—seams, laps, die lines, zinc
    pickup—erode yield and customer trust. Internal: Too many variables (die
    condition, reduction schedule, lube, speed, temperature, zinc) make root
    cause slow and political. Philosophical: Your images and process data should
    tell you what to do next—without more firefighting.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know a rejected coil and a 0.5% yield loss are costly.
    Authority: Metallurgy + computer-vision experts with proven wire-defect
    models; secure OT/IT integration; explainable analytics that connect vision
    to process and countermeasures.
  plan: >-
    1) Readiness check: share sample defect images and a tag map (dies, speeds,
    temps, lube, zinc). 2) 30-day pilot on one line: classify defects, correlate
    with process windows, and issue ranked countermeasures; baseline yield/PPM.
    3) Scale and embed: deploy operator alerts and RCA dashboards; integrate
    with SCADA/MES/LIMS; quarterly model refresh and countermeasure library
    updates.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo and submit sample images for a free readiness
    assessment. Transitional: Download the Surface Defect Checklist and a sample
    RCA report.
  success: >-
    Higher yield and first‑pass quality; fewer stops and claims.
    Minutes‑to‑cause diagnostics; stable die/lube windows; confident audits. A
    shared, explainable AI that coaches operators and accelerates
    problem‑solving across lines.
  failure: >-
    Persistent seams, laps, die lines, and zinc pickup. Ongoing scrap, rework,
    missed shipments, and chargebacks. Another black‑box tool that doesn’t
    connect images to process or say what to do next.
