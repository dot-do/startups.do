leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High lead leakage: 30–50% of digital RV leads drop before completing a
      finance pre-qualification due to long forms and friction-heavy processes.
    - >-
      Manual and inconsistent compliance: Dealers struggle to consistently
      capture FCRA/Reg V consent, deliver risk-based/adverse action notices,
      TCPA-compliant SMS consent, GLBA disclosures, and maintain audit trails.
    - >-
      Slow F&I handoff: Missing or incomplete stips (POI/POA/ID/insurance) cause
      1–3 day delays and lender rehashing, lowering funding rates and CSI.
    - >-
      Payment confusion: Shoppers abandon when they cannot see realistic
      payments with taxes/fees/terms; F&I spends time reworking scenarios.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: Separate chat, forms, credit, e-sign, IDV, and DMS/LOS
      create swivel-chair workflows and duplicate data entry.
    - >-
      Limited RV-specific digital retail support: Most auto-focused tools lack
      RV lender rules, RV tax/title/registration nuances, and doc checklists
      specific to RV financings.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven pre-qualification flow via web, SMS, or QR that captures
      soft-credit consent, identity details, and income data in under 3 minutes.
    - >-
      Dynamic payment scenarios with RV-specific taxes/fees, down payment, term,
      rate ranges, and disclaimers; supports good/better/best options and
      buy/lease (where applicable).
    - >-
      Automated doc package builder that requests, validates, and organizes
      stips (POI, POA, DL, references, insurance binder, down-payment proof)
      with e-sign where appropriate.
    - >-
      Routing/push to RouteOne/Dealertrack/AppOne with complete data and
      documents; one-click handoff to F&I with an audit trail.
    - >-
      Built-in compliance engine for FCRA/Reg V, ECOA/Reg B, GLBA/Reg P &
      Safeguards Rule, Red Flags, OFAC, E-Sign/UETA, and TCPA with configurable
      templates and logs.
    - >-
      Dealer-configurable lender/program matrix tuned to RV lenders (credit
      unions, banks, captives) to guide doc/stip requirements and payment logic.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase funded RV finance deals by 10–20% and cut F&I prep time 30–50% with
    an RV-specific AI assistant that collects compliant pre-qual apps, presents
    realistic payments, and assembles a lender-ready doc package automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A defensible RV-specific compliance and lender-doc knowledge graph plus deep
    integrations (LOS/DMS/IDV) that enable a truly end-to-end, lender-ready
    package from consumer intake through F&I handoff—reducing kickbacks and
    time-to-fund in ways generic auto chat/forms solutions cannot easily
    replicate.

    1) Configure: connect CRM/DMS, lenders, forms, and consents. 2) Capture &
    quote: AI collects a compliant soft-pull pre-qual and shows real payment

    and lender.
