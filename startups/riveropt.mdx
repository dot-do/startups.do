leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fuel is 25–45% of inland vessel OPEX; lack of predictive, segment-level
      speed guidance leads to 5–15% avoidable fuel burn.
    - >-
      Unpredictable lock queues force buffers or last‑minute speeding, causing
      late arrivals or excess fuel use and CO2.
    - >-
      Captains rely on experience, fragmented data (AIS, river gauges, weather),
      and manual calculations not optimized across the full route.
    - >-
      Arrival windows (terminal slots, bridge openings, curfews) are missed
      15–30% of the time on busy corridors, triggering penalties, demurrage, and
      lost reputation.
    - >-
      Operators lack auditable evidence of eco-steaming for customer ESG
      reporting and insurer incentives.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization engine combining physics-based resistance models with
      ML forecasts of currents, wind, and lock waiting times.
    - >-
      Turn-by-turn speed profile by river segment that meets ETA windows while
      minimizing fuel and respecting safety/traffic constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization when conditions change (draft, river stage, wind
      gusts, lock outages, traffic).
    - >-
      Captain UI: clear setpoint guidance, buffer indicators, and “what-if”
      sliders for ETA, fuel, and risk; offline cache for connectivity gaps.
    - >-
      Dispatcher console: fleet-wide ETA reliability, lock risk heatmaps, and
      exception alerts with recommended mitigations.
    - >-
      API/SDK to integrate with ECDIS, engine control, and TMS; optional edge
      gateway for on-board data fusion.
    - >-
      Automated ESG/CO2 reports per trip and per ton-km, exportable to
      customer/insurer formats.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit arrival windows with the least fuel. RiverOpt AI fuses river hydraulics,
    lock-queue forecasts, weather, and vessel performance to produce a safe,
    captain-friendly speed plan that cuts fuel 6–12% and reduces late arrivals
    20–40%, with auditable CO2 reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated lock-queue prediction dataset and model library by river/lock,
    combined with per-vessel calibrated fuel curves and segment-level
    hydrodynamics, delivered via OEM/ECDIS integrations and insurer-backed ROI
    guarantees—hard for generic voyage optimizers to replicate on inland
    waterways.

    Inland waterway barge operators, fleet dispatchers, and towboat captains who
    must deliver on time while cutting fuel costs.
  problem: >-
    Fuel prices, shifting currents and winds, and unpredictable lock delays
    force guesswork; crews waste fuel or miss arrival windows, eroding margins
    and trust—it shouldn’t be a gamble to move freight on rivers.
  guide: >-
    Fuel and Speed Optimization Advisor is your AI river pilot: we understand
    towboat operations, and our models use AIS, hydrology, weather, and lock
    data to deliver clear, proven recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Set route, tow details, and arrival window; 2) AI fuses current, wind,
    and lock forecasts to propose a fuel-minimum speed profile with buffers; 3)
    Execute with in-transit updates and variance alerts, then receive a savings
    report for continuous improvement.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or start a 30-day pilot on one lane; for a low-commitment step,
    download a sample lane analysis and fuel-savings calculator.
  success: >-
    Consistent on-time arrivals, often 5–15% lower fuel use, fewer penalties and
    overtime, calmer wheelhouse operations, reduced emissions, and measurable
    ROI per tow.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing fuel waste, missed or early-arrival penalties, stressed crews,
    unpredictable ETAs, dissatisfied shippers, and shrinking margins.
