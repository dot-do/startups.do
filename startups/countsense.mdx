  problem:
    - >-
      Cycle counting is scheduled by static ABC rules and wall-clock frequency,
      not by actual risk signals (recent activity, exceptions, operator
      patterns), causing misallocated labor and missed high-impact
      discrepancies.
    - >-
      Variance investigations require stitching together WMS logs, LPN
      histories, ASN/receipt data, pick/pack/ship tasks, and adjustments across
      systems; this is slow, error-prone, and often inconclusive.
    - >-
      Supervisors lack audit-ready, evidence-backed adjustment recommendations,
      delaying approvals and leaving variances to age, resulting in chargebacks,
      customer claims, and stockouts.
    - >-
      Policies drift with seasonality, new SKUs, and process changes; there is
      no closed-loop feedback that learns which locations, products, and
      processes are likely to be wrong next.
    - >-
      Inventory drones/RFID and WMS counting modules collect data, but do not
      prioritize where to count next or explain root causes, limiting ROI from
      counting automation.
    - >-
      3PLs are squeezed by SLAs and thin margins; they need measurable labor
      savings, higher inventory accuracy, and fewer customer disputes without
      costly WMS replatforms.
  solution:
    - >-
      Risk-based cycle count prioritization that scores every storage location
      daily using multi-signal ML (transaction velocity, exception/error codes,
      operator patterns, replenishment/relocation churn, adjacent-bin
      correlations, SKU attributes, historical variance).
    - >-
      Real-time variance monitoring that flags suspect balances immediately
      after risky events (receipts, moves, picks, consolidations) with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Automated evidence packs that reconstruct an event timeline across
      ASN→GR→Putaway→Moves→Picks→Pack→Ship→Return, link to images/scans, and
      cite specific log lines to justify a proposed adjustment.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: propose, review, e-sign, and post adjustments
      back to WMS/ERP; SOC 2 and 21 CFR Part 11-ready approval workflows and
      immutable audit trails.
    - >-
      What-if simulator that allocates counting labor to hit a target accuracy
      and variance $ exposure threshold at minimum cost; shows marginal ROI of
      more/less counting.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play connectors for major WMS/ERPs and device signals (RF
      scanners, scales, RFID portals, drones) with data quality checks and
      schema mapping templates.
    - >-
      Root-cause analytics that categorize variances (receiving, putaway, pick
      short/over, mis-scan, location contamination, unit-of-measure) and
      quantify top systemic issues to fix.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Raise inventory accuracy to 99%+ with 30–50% fewer cycle count labor hours
    by ranking the next best locations to count and auto-generating
    evidence-backed adjustment recommendations ready for approval and posting in
    your WMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Event-lineage and evidence engine purpose-built for warehouses that
    reconstructs the who/what/when/where of every unit, enabling high-precision,
    auditor-ready adjustment recommendations; coupled with a cross-warehouse,
    anonymized dataset that bootstraps accurate risk scoring on day one and
    improves with each count outcome. Deep WMS integrations and compliance
    workflows reduce customer lift and accelerate time-to-value.
