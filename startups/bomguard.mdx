  problem:
    - >-
      EBOM-to-MBOM mismatches (missing parts, wrong revisions, incorrect
      quantities/UoM, substitutes not carried through) cause line stoppages,
      rework, and quality escapes in pump/motor builds.
    - >-
      Manual reconciliation across CAD/PDM and ERP is labor-intensive (often
      4–12 hours per ECN) and error-prone, especially with high option/variant
      complexity (shaft types, porting, displacement, mounting).
    - >-
      Change effectivity and serialization gaps (EBOM rev vs. MBOM effective
      date vs. production order) create audit and traceability risks (ISO
      9001/IATF/AS9100 where applicable).
    - >-
      Phantom assemblies, service kits, consumables (sealants, test fluids), and
      supplier alternates create “expected differences” that are hard to encode
      in brittle scripts.
    - >-
      Data silos and inconsistent naming/attribute schemas between PLM/PDM and
      ERP slow down ECN cycle times and NPI readiness.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest EBOM from CAD/PDM (e.g., PTC Windchill, Siemens
      Teamcenter, SolidWorks PDM, Autodesk Vault) and MBOM from ERP (SAP,
      Oracle, Infor, Epicor, MS Dynamics).
    - >-
      Normalize, map, and diff structures with a domain rule engine
      (variants/options, phantom assemblies, expected consumables) plus an ML
      layer trained on historical corrections.
    - >-
      Flag mismatches: qty/UoM, revision/effectivity, alternates/substitutes,
      make/buy, serialization, missing/extra lines, attribute misalignments
      (finish, material, porting).
    - >-
      Propose corrections with confidence scores: MBOM line updates, ECO
      suggestions, alternates selection, effectivity date adjustments, and
      routing to the right owner via workflow.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards: risk-scored work queues, ECN readiness gates,
      first-pass reconciliation rate, and trend analytics. Integration
      back-writes to ERP/PLM via APIs where permitted.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, domain-tuned EBOM↔MBOM reconciliation for fluid power: catch
    mismatches before jobs hit the floor, auto-suggest correct fixes, and
    compress ECN cycle time by 30–60% with audit-ready traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned rule and ML library for fluid power pump/motor EBOM↔MBOM
    reconciliation, trained on real correction data and option structures, plus
    certified connectors for top PLM/ERP stacks. Feedback loops from pilots
    create a proprietary dataset and rules corpus that general-purpose PLM/ERP
    integrations lack.

    Ops leaders, engineering managers, and ERP/PDM owners at fluid power pump
    and motor manufacturers (NAICS 333996) who need EBOM–MBOM alignment for
    right‑first‑time builds.
  problem: >-
    EBOM from CAD/PDM and MBOM in ERP drift apart, causing wrong part numbers,
    missing seals/fasteners, incorrect alternates, and phantom
    assemblies—leading to misbuilds, late ECOs, line stoppages, excess WIP, and
    audit risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand hydraulic pump and motor complexity and the cost of a single
    wrong seal or port option. Our AI CAD‑to‑BOM Consistency Checker
    continuously reconciles EBOM and MBOM and guides teams with precise,
    auditable fixes.
  plan: >-
    1 Connect CAD/PDM and ERP via secure connectors. 2 Run a baseline compare on
    active items and set business rules. 3 Go live with alerts, suggested
    corrections, and approval workflow.
  callToAction: Schedule a demo and start a 30‑day pilot on one product line.
  success: >-
    Aligned EBOM–MBOM, faster releases, fewer change orders, higher first‑pass
    yield, lower scrap and expedite costs, clean audits, and on‑time shipments.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting BOM errors, pay for rework and warranty claims, miss ship
    dates, fail audits, and erode margins.
