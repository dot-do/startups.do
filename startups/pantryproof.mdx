leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual invoice entry and COGS reconciliation consumes 8–20 hours per store
      per week; error rates of 1–3% lead to misstatements and rework.
    - >-
      Vendor invoices vary wildly (PDF/email/photo, non-EDI, handwritten notes,
      catch-weight items, mixed units of measure), making 2/3-way matching to
      POs/receipts impractical at scale.
    - >-
      Price, quantity, and UOM variances go undetected; 0.5–2.0% margin leakage
      from overcharges, missed credits, substitutions, and shrink.
    - >-
      Month-end close is delayed 3–7 days due to invoice backlog and unresolved
      discrepancies; limited visibility into item-level COGS and shrink drivers.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (POS/inventory, accounting, AP) require swivel-chair
      reconciliation; specialty food retailers often rely on QuickBooks + POS
      without robust invoice capture.
    - >-
      Small/local vendors have low EDI adoption; retailers need OCR that
      actually handles vendor-specific quirks and specialty food nuances.
  solution:
    - >-
      Specialty-food-tuned OCR/ML: line-item extraction from PDFs/photos,
      including catch-weight, lot codes, pack sizes, fees (freight, deposits),
      and credits.
    - >-
      UOM normalization and mapping: convert lb/oz/kg/case/each; maintain
      item-mapping graph linking vendor SKUs to retailer PLUs/UPCs and
      categories.
    - >-
      2/3-way match: auto-match invoices to POs and receiving logs from
      POS/inventory; tolerance-based matching (price/qty/UOM); smart handling of
      substitutions and partial receipts.
    - >-
      Variance engine: flag price deltas, quantity short/over, UOM mismatches,
      and unexpected fees; configurable thresholds; root-cause tagging (vendor
      price change, receiving error, promo).
    - >-
      Shrink and margin analytics: reconcile sold vs received vs theoretical;
      identify top shrink drivers and vendor/items causing margin leakage;
      actionable dashboards.
    - >-
      AP + GL integration: push coded bills/line-level COGS to
      QuickBooks/Xero/NetSuite; auto-attach invoice images; support approval
      workflows and audit trails.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: exception handling with <2-hour turnaround; final
      accuracy target ≥99.5%; vendor template library grows over time.
    - >-
      Easy capture: email ingestion (invoices@), drag-and-drop, mobile capture
      with auto-crop; EDI 810 ingestion where available.
    - >-
      Security & compliance: SOC 2 roadmap, PII minimization, encryption at
      rest/in transit, role-based access, detailed audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy vendor invoices into reconciled COGS and shrink alerts
    automatically—purpose-built for specialty food retailers. Cut invoice
    processing time by 80%, recover 0.5–1.5% margin, and close the books 3–5
    days faster, with catch-weight and UOM mastery.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing vendor template and item-mapping graph purpose-built for specialty
    food (catch-weight/UOM nuances) that compounds with each client, combined
    with human-in-the-loop QA achieving >99.5% final accuracy and fast SLAs.
    Deep POS/accounting integrations and distributor relationships reduce
    onboarding friction and create data network effects and switching costs.
