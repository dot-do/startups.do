  title: Trailer/Teaser Rough-Cut Assistant
  description: >-
    AI generates beat-driven selects and rough cut options for trailers/teasers
    from a locked cut or dailies.
  targetUsers:
    - Trailer houses
    - Marketing teams
    - Indie distributors
  triggers:
    - Client uploads feature/episode or selects EDL
  inputs:
    - Full video or timeline (XML/EDL)
    - Key themes/target tone
    - Music library access or references
  steps:
    - Shot/scene detection and transcript extraction
    - Emotion/beat analysis to rank hero moments
    - Pull candidate bites and visuals into paper edit
    - Auto-score music suggestions and tempo align
    - Generate 2–3 cut options and export EDL/XML
    - Optional human editor review and polish
  tools:
    - PySceneDetect
    - Whisper
    - OpenAI/LLM for beat analysis
    - OpenTimelineIO
    - ffmpeg
    - 'Music tagging/search API (e.g., APM, Artlist)'
  outputs:
    - Selects bin manifest
    - Rough-cut EDL/XML for Premiere/Resolve
    - Cue sheet draft
    - Thumbnail frames
  pricingModel:
    - Per minute of source runtime + per rough-cut option
    - 'Add-on: human editor polish'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Creative subjectivity; may miss legal/brand constraints
    - Music licensing constraints
    - Requires robust notes for tone
  dependencies:
    - Access to full-resolution or proxies
    - Music library credentials
    - Brand/MPAA guidelines if applicable

  problem:
    - >-
      Trailer and teaser editors lose 20–60 hours per asset doing manual line
      pulls, beat-finding, and alt-option assemblies from dailies or a locked
      cut.
    - >-
      Producers routinely request multiple beat-aligned alternates under tight
      deadlines (festival premieres, test screenings, drops), creating overtime
      and capacity bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Finding clean dialogue, alt takes, and performance moments across dailies
      is slow and error-prone; assistants scrub footage manually and maintain
      fragile spreadsheets/bins.
    - >-
      Music selection and beat mapping are manual; syncing emotional/impact
      beats to picture requires repeated trial-and-error.
    - >-
      Security constraints (pre-release content, watermarks, chain of custody)
      prohibit use of generic cloud AI tools; TPN/MPA compliance is mandatory.
    - >-
      Existing NLE features (transcription, scene detection) don’t output
      trailer-ready, beat-aligned assemblies or curated “selects reels” that map
      to common trailer structures.
    - >-
      Versioning/localization (TV spots, social cutdowns, MPA rating edits)
      require rapid re-assemblies; manual workflows don’t scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests a locked cut or dailies, detects shots, faces/characters,
      emotional intensity, and dialogue quality, and generates curated “selects
      reels.”
    - >-
      Music analysis creates a beat grid and suggests cut points; the system
      assembles multiple rough-cut options mapped to common trailer structures
      (teaser, 3-act, character, action).
    - >-
      Editors interactively approve/reject selects, swap music options, and
      regenerate alternatives; output as AAF/EDL/XML with bins, markers, and
      labeled sequences.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: TPN-compliant cloud, customer VPC, or on-prem
      GPU appliance with audit logs and watermarking.
    - >-
      Integrations with Frame.io/iconik/LucidLink/Signiant/Aspera enable
      existing media pipelines without duplicate uploads.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From locked cut or dailies to beat-aligned selects bins and multiple
    trailer-ready rough cut options in under 30 minutes—secure,
    editor-controllable, and integrated with Avid, Premiere Pro, and Resolve.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A trailer-specific, rights-cleared dataset and template library co-developed
    with leading trailer houses; TPN-compliant deployments including on-prem;
    deep NLE export fidelity (AAF/EDL/XML) and integrations that preserve
    bins/markers and editorial intent—making the assistant genuinely
    editor-first rather than generic auto-edit.
