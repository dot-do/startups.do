  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent, low-volume demand causes high forecast error when using
      standard methods (naive, moving average, exponential smoothing), leading
      to frequent stockouts and excess inventory on long-tail SKUs.
    - >-
      Static ERP reorder points and safety stocks are rarely maintained due to
      planner bandwidth; parameters drift and become misaligned with current
      demand and lead-time variability.
    - >-
      Long and volatile supplier lead times (imported and specialized
      components) force high safety stock buffers, tying up working capital and
      increasing carrying costs (20–30% per year).
    - >-
      Expedites to avoid missed customer SLAs drive avoidable costs and margin
      erosion; lack of forward visibility causes reactionary buying and poor
      consolidation against MOQs.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/WMS/PO systems and manual spreadsheets prevents
      policy optimization at the SKU-location level and across echelons.
    - >-
      Executives lack credible, SKU-level, service-level-targeted inventory
      policies with auditable rationale to balance fill rate, cash, and space
      constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rapid data onboarding from ERP/WMS (orders, shipments, lead times,
      supplier attributes, item masters) with automated data quality checks and
      intermittent-demand classification.
    - >-
      Intermittent-demand forecasting engine (Croston variants: SBA/TSB,
      Bayesian hierarchical models, demand-occurrence classification) selected
      per SKU-location via backtesting and MASE/wMAPE minimization.
    - >-
      Policy optimization to compute service-level-targeted safety stock,
      reorder point, and EOQ that respect supplier MOQs, case packs, price
      breaks, and lead-time variability; supports single- and multi-echelon.
    - >-
      Discrete-event simulation and what-if analysis to quantify trade-offs
      between service, inventory, and expedite cost before publishing policies.
    - >-
      Closed-loop ERP integration to publish parameters and monitor realized
      performance (fill rate, stockouts, inventory turns, carrying cost, order
      frequency).
    - >-
      Planner cockpit with alerts for parameter drift, lead-time shifts, demand
      regime changes, and vendor risk; workflow for review/approval and
      exception-based planning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts 30–50% and release 10–20% working capital on long-tail SKUs
    in 90 days by generating AI-optimized safety stocks, reorder points, and
    order quantities purpose-built for intermittent demand and pushed directly
    into your ERP—fully auditable, constraint-aware, and measurable against your
    service level targets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built intermittent-demand engine with auto-model selection and
    constraint-aware policy optimization, trained on anonymized SKU-location
    patterns specific to transportation equipment distributors; out-of-the-box
    ERP connectors and an explainability layer that makes policies auditable to
    CFOs and planners. Speed-to-value via a 90-day pilot framework with A/B
    testing and ROI guarantees reduces buyer risk.
