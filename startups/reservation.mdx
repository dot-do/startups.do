leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Most wineries rely on tasting rooms and DTC for margins, but upsells are
      handled ad hoc by staff, leaving 10–30% revenue per reservation untapped.
    - >-
      Reservation platforms capture bookings but rarely personalize pre-arrival
      or post-visit outreach across SMS/email; offers are generic and poorly
      timed.
    - >-
      Staffing is lean and seasonal; manual reminders for cheese pairings,
      tours, shipping, and club follow-ups are inconsistent and not measured.
    - >-
      Compliance (TCPA for SMS, alcohol shipping restrictions, age verification)
      is complex; fear of violations limits proactive outreach.
    - >-
      Attribution is unclear—wineries can’t see incremental revenue by
      channel/offer or tie it back to specific reservations, parties, or
      cohorts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with reservation systems (e.g., Tock, CellarPass) to sync guest,
      party size, visit date, and experience type.
    - >-
      Automated pre-arrival sequences (48–72 hours before): offer cheese
      pairings, premium flights, private tours, and transportation add-ons;
      day-of reminders for add-ons not purchased.
    - >-
      Post-visit flows (24 hours to 14 days): one-time shipping offers, club
      invite tailored to preferences purchased, and review request if no
      purchase.
    - >-
      Personalization using party size, past purchases, membership status,
      weather/weekend factors, and booking channel; dynamic offer ranking by
      predicted acceptance.
    - >-
      Message orchestration across SMS + email with explicit opt-in capture,
      quiet hours, throttling, and TCPA/CTIA compliance.
    - >-
      Real-time ROI dashboard: incremental revenue per reservation (IRR), attach
      rate per offer, A/B test uplift, opt-in/unsubscribe, and staff time saved.
    - >-
      Staff console with same-day upsell prompts for hosts; QR codes at check-in
      that trigger contextual offers to guest phones.
    - >-
      Compliance-aware shipping offers via ShipCompliant integration (state
      eligibility, carrier, adult signature) and 1-click checkout via
      Commerce7/WineDirect.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase revenue per reservation by 15–30% with automated, compliant, and
    personalized upsell journeys—pre-arrival to post-visit—fully integrated with
    your reservation, POS, and club systems, with clear attribution and ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized dataset and model library for winery upsells (not generic
    retail), native integrations with reservation + club + compliance systems,
    and a compliance-first orchestration engine. Combined with early partner
    marketplace presence and published regional benchmarks, this creates
    switching costs and defensibility beyond simple SMS/email automation.
