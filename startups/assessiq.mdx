  problem:
    - >-
      Average auto physical damage claim cycle time is 7–12 days and property
      claims 14–30 days, driving low NPS and rental car costs; carriers need
      sub-24 hour decisions for simple claims
    - >-
      Adjuster shortages and CAT surge events create backlogs; field inspections
      for roofs and collision damage are costly and unsafe
    - >-
      High leakage and rework: auto supplement rates often exceed 40 percent,
      and inconsistent estimating increases indemnity and LAE
    - >-
      Limited triage at FNOL; many claims unnecessarily routed to field or body
      shop when virtual handling is sufficient
    - >-
      Poor fraud detection in photo claims, including stock-image reuse and
      AI-edited images
    - >-
      Unstructured photos and videos are not converted into line items and
      repair operations that integrate with core systems, slowing
      straight-through processing
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision models detect and localize vehicle and property damage,
      estimate severity and probable repair cost ranges, and classify total-loss
      likelihood with calibrated probabilities
    - >-
      Generates recommended repair operations and labor times aligned to OEM
      procedures and industry estimating systems, enabling draft estimates and
      triage rules
    - >-
      Property module processes smartphone and drone imagery for roof, siding,
      and interior damage including hail and wind, with slope-aware 3D
      reconstruction for quantity takeoff
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review queue for exceptions with service-level options
      under 30 minutes to keep cycle times low
    - >-
      Explainable outputs with damage heatmaps, part-level confidence, and
      line-item rationales to pass regulatory scrutiny and support adjuster
      acceptance
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors to Guidewire ClaimCenter, Duck Creek Claims, and data
      export mappings for CCC, Mitchell, and Audatex workflows
    - >-
      Fraud and compliance checks including image tamper detection, device
      fingerprinting, EXIF anomalies, duplicate image search, and weather-peril
      validation
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, explainable damage assessment from photos and videos that reduces
    cycle time by 2–5 days, cuts supplements 15–30 percent, increases
    straight-through processing to 20–40 percent, and flags likely totals and
    fraud—delivered via SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant APIs pre-integrated with
    leading claims platforms.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-line, privacy-compliant dataset combining auto and property damage
    with video-based 3D reconstruction, plus explainable line-item mapping
    aligned to OEM procedures and prebuilt connectors to Guidewire and Duck
    Creek; validated regulatory artifacts and benchmarked performance on carrier
    holdout sets reduce procurement and compliance friction.

    Property & auto insurance carriers and claims leaders who need faster, fair,
    and consistent damage assessments at scale.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual photo review and fragmented tools slow adjusting, drive
    LAE, and create leakage. Internal: Teams feel pressure to close claims
    faster while maintaining accuracy and fairness. Philosophical: Policyholders
    deserve immediate, transparent resolutions after a loss.
  guide: >-
    We understand claim surges, estimate disputes, and leakage risk. Our
    computer-vision service analyzes photos/video to estimate severity, probable
    repair operations, and total-loss likelihood—delivering explainable,
    auditable outputs via API, web, or mobile. Built for enterprise security,
    easy integration, and human-in-the-loop oversight.
  plan: >-
    1) Discovery: 30‑min demo and data/privacy review. 2) Pilot: connect API or
    app, run sample claims, calibrate thresholds and SLAs. 3) Rollout: integrate
    with claims platform, auto-route by severity/TTL, enable adjuster review and
    audit reporting.

    Direct: Book a demo and start a 30‑day pilot with clear success criteria.
    Transitional: Download the one‑pager and sample report.
  success: >-
    Minutes-to-estimates from photos/video; faster triage and total-loss
    decisions; consistent, auditable outputs; reduced cycle time and LAE;
    improved customer satisfaction and reserve accuracy; scalable surge
    response.
  failure: >-
    Backlogs, inconsistent estimates, higher leakage and LAE, frustrated
    policyholders, lost market share, and increased regulatory scrutiny.

      Instant severity scoring, probable repair operations, and total‑loss
      likelihood—so your adjusters can triage and settle faster.
    ctaText: Request a demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Manual inspections slow claims and frustrate policyholders.
    - Inconsistent estimates increase leakage and re‑inspections.
    - Adjuster capacity is strained during CAT and surge events.
    - Fragmented media intake and poor data quality delay decisions.
    - >-
      Core systems lack real‑time triage signals (severity, total loss, repair
      path).
  solution:
    - Upload photos or video; get an AI assessment in seconds.
    - 'Severity score, suggested repair operations, and total‑loss probability.'
    - Automated media QC (blurry/angle detection) with guided recapture.
    - 'API and widgets for FNOL, Guidewire/Duck Creek, and self‑service portals.'
    - Human‑in‑the‑loop review and full audit trail for compliance.
  features:

      siding, interior).
    - Video frame selection; duplicates and blur removed automatically.
    - Explanation heatmaps and confidence for each finding.
    - >-
      Fraud/tamper checks and metadata verification (EXIF, timestamp,
      geolocation).
    - 'Rule‑based routing: fast‑track, desk, field, or total‑loss paths.'
    - 'Scalable, CAT‑ready processing with SLA monitoring and alerts.'
    - >-
      Enterprise‑grade security: SSO, RBAC, encryption in transit/at rest, SOC
      2‑aligned controls.
    - Localized claimant UX with SMS/email capture links.
    - Optional links to parts databases and preferred repair networks.
  steps:
    - 'Invite: Send a secure link from FNOL or CRM to capture photos/video.'
    - 'Capture: Guided prompts ensure coverage and quality; automatic QC runs.'
    - >-
      Assess: AI returns severity, probable repair ops, and total‑loss
      likelihood.
    - >-
      Act: Results sync to core systems to set reserves, route, and trigger next
      steps.
    - 'Review: Adjusters validate quickly; exceptions escalate to human review.'
    - 'Learn: Closed‑claim outcomes feed continuous model improvements.'
