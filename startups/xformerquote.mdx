  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier quotes arrive in inconsistent formats (PDF, email, XLS, portals)
      with different units, currencies, Incoterms, and yield assumptions,
      causing apples-to-oranges comparisons.
    - >-
      Award decisions rely on manual spreadsheets that miss true TCO (price +
      logistics + duty/tariffs + payment terms + expected scrap/yield +
      warranty/quality + expedite costs).
    - >-
      Lead times and delivery reliability are volatile (GOES steel, copper), but
      buyer teams lack quantified delivery-risk models, leading to late
      deliveries and penalties.
    - >-
      Cycle time from RFQ to PO can exceed 10–15 business days, delaying
      production schedules and increasing inventory buffers.
    - >-
      Maverick buying and limited auditability increase compliance risk and
      price variance (PPV).
    - >-
      Limited visibility into supplier performance (OTIF, PPM, claim rates)
      prevents optimal award splits and dual-sourcing strategies.
    - >-
      Currency fluctuations and commodity volatility (LME copper, GOES) are not
      systematically reflected in awards or price-indexing clauses.
    - >-
      Shortage of knowledgeable procurement analysts in transformer-specific
      materials (e.g., GOES stacking factor, core loss implications) leads to
      errors in normalization and awards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of quotes from email, PDFs, spreadsheets, portals, and
      EDI with 95%+ line-item extraction accuracy and confidence scoring.
    - >-
      Normalization engine converts currencies, units (kg/lb, sheet/coil),
      Incoterms, duties/tariffs, logistics, payment-terms cost of capital, and
      expected scrap/yield by commodity.
    - >-
      Transformer-specific yield calculators (e.g., GOES coil-to-lamination
      yield, stacking factors, copper foil/wire conversion, oil quantity vs kVA)
      to standardize cost bases.
    - >-
      Integrated TCO model including material price, freight lanes, duties,
      inventory carrying cost, warranty risk, supplier quality PPM, expedite
      likelihood, and claim history.
    - >-
      Delivery-risk scoring using supplier OTIF, quoted vs actual lead time
      variance, capacity/load signals, port congestion, geopolitical and credit
      risk, and commodity volatility.
    - >-
      Optimization-based award recommendations (single/dual/multi-source) with
      constraints (AVL, min/ max allocations, MOQ/MOV, regional split,
      compliance) and scenario comparison.
    - >-
      1-click PO creation and ERP integration (SAP/Oracle/Infor,
      Ariba/Coupa/Jaggaer/Ivalua) with audit trails and approval workflows.
    - >-
      Supplier scorecards, contract guardrails (indexation formulas, surcharge
      logic), and proactive re-quote triggers when markets move beyond
      thresholds.
    - >-
      What-if simulations for expediting, split awards, and alternative
      Incoterms/lanes with savings and risk deltas.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop explainability: rationale for recommendations,
      sensitivity analysis, and change logs for audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Normalize multi-supplier quotes into a true TCO and delivery-risk view and
    recommend optimal award/POs in hours, not weeks—cutting 1–3% direct-material
    costs and reducing late-delivery risk by 20–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Transformer-specific TCO/risk normalization IP and benchmark datasets
    (yield, OTIF, PPV) that generalist sourcing tools lack; growing supplier
    network using standardized templates creates a data and adoption flywheel;
    pre-built ERP connectors reduce time-to-value and switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Procurement leaders, sourcing engineers, and project managers at power,
    distribution, and specialty transformer manufacturers who must award steel,
    copper, oil, and accessory buys under tight deadlines and margin targets.
  problem: >-
    External: Supplier quotes arrive in inconsistent formats with hidden
    surcharges, yields/scrap, currencies, Incoterms, and lead times—hard to
    compare apples-to-apples.

    Internal: Teams lack time and confidence to justify awards and negotiate
    from a single source of truth.

    Philosophical: Critical grid equipment deserves transparent, fair awards
    that balance total cost and delivery risk.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of tight bids, volatile metals, and
    project-critical delivery dates.

    Authority: Built by transformer supply-chain veterans and AI practitioners;
    secure, auditable, and aligned with procurement best practices.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload supplier quotes or connect inbox/ERP. 2) AI normalizes to
    a common schema, models TCO (material, scrap, freight, duties, financing)
    and delivery risk. 3) Receive ranked award recommendations, splits, and
    PO-ready line items with rationale.

    Agreement: Start with a low-risk pilot on recent RFQs; you control decision
    rules and data stays private.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and pilot an RFQ.

    Transitional: Download our normalization template and TCO/risk model
    overview.
  success: >-
    Awards in hours, not days; confident negotiations from a single source of
    truth; optimized TCO with on-time delivery; scenario planning (dual-source,
    caps, incumbents); audit-ready justification; faster PO placement and
    smoother execution.
  failure: >-
    Overpaying due to hidden costs, late deliveries and expediting, margin
    erosion, firefighting on projects, strained supplier relationships, and
    audit/ISO findings without clear award rationale.
