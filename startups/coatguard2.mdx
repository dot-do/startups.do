  title: Price Optimization & Contract Guardrails
  description: >-
    Optimizes price lists and enforces contract rules during quoting; explains
    price changes with a margin waterfall.
  targetUsers:
    - Pricing Manager
    - Sales Ops
    - Finance
  triggers:
    - Monthly pricing review
    - Cost change from suppliers
    - Large quote created
  inputs:
    - Current price lists and costs
    - Contracts by customer/segment
    - Win/loss data and elasticity proxies
    - Competitive benchmarks (optional)
  steps:
    - Build price waterfall (cost-to-quote) and identify leakage
    - Cluster customers/SKUs for elasticity/profitability
    - Recommend list/segment price changes and floors
    - Check quotes against contracts and flag exceptions
    - Explain recommendations in plain language
    - Sync approved updates to ERP/CPQ
  tools:
    - LLM for explanation
    - Optimization/linear programming
    - ERP/CPQ APIs
    - BI for tracking KPIs
  outputs:
    - Recommended price updates
    - Guardrail rules (floors/ceilings)
    - Exception report with rationale
    - Updated ERP price lists
  pricingModel:
    - Subscription + setup
    - Optional gainshare on margin uplift

  problem:
    - >-
      Price lists and matrices are outdated, inconsistent across branches, and
      not responsive to raw material cost swings (e.g., TiO2, resins, solvents),
      causing margin leakage of 150–300 bps.
    - >-
      Sales reps override prices to “win the deal,” but lack guardrails tied to
      contract terms, freight/hazmat fees, and minimums, leading to unprofitable
      quotes and compliance exposure.
    - >-
      Contract price rules (floors, regional exceptions, SPAs/rebates) are hard
      to enforce in real time across ERP, CPQ, and ecommerce channels.
    - >-
      Management cannot explain price changes to customers; lack of transparent
      margin waterfall erodes trust and increases churn.
    - >-
      Manual price updates take 2–6 weeks and are error-prone; by the time
      updates go live, market conditions have shifted.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, rebates, vendor costs) prevents data-driven price
      decisions and rapid response to cost changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Bottom-up price optimization: segment SKUs by velocity, sensitivity, and
      value; recommend new list/matrix prices by customer/region/channel with
      elasticity-aware targets.
    - >-
      Contract guardrails engine: enforce floors, exception logic,
      freight/hazmat adders, min order/pack, and SPA/rebate eligibility in real
      time across ERP, CPQ, and ecommerce.
    - >-
      Margin waterfall & explainability: show base price, discounts, freight,
      hazmat, rebates/SPAs, and landed cost to net margin; auto-generate
      customer-facing rationale for changes.
    - >-
      Dynamic cost index linkage: map SKUs to raw material indices (e.g., TiO2,
      resin, solvent PPIs) to trigger timely list updates with thresholds and
      auto-communication workflows.
    - >-
      Approval workflows: tiered approvals when quotes breach guardrails;
      justify overrides with reason codes and instant simulations to recover
      margin.
    - >-
      A/B pricing pilots: test recommended prices on selected
      branches/customers; monitor win-rate and realization before full rollout.
    - >-
      Integration kit: prebuilt connectors for Epicor Prophet 21, Infor
      SX.e/CloudSuite Distribution, Microsoft Dynamics 365, NetSuite, SAP
      Business One; REST API/flat-file fallbacks.
    - >-
      Sales rep tools: quote plug-in with guardrail alerts, cross-sell/upsell,
      and price realization nudges; inline competitor/market signals.
    - >-
      Analytics: leakage dashboards, override heatmaps, branch scorecards, and
      price realization tracking by segment/customer/SKU.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native pricing and contract guardrails purpose-built for paint and
    coatings distribution—optimize price lists, enforce rules at quote-time, and
    justify every price with an explainable margin waterfall—delivering 150–400
    bps margin uplift within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized IP for coatings distribution (SKU taxonomy + index mapping +
    price architecture playbooks), explainable AI tuned to list-to-net pricing
    in distribution, and prebuilt ERP connectors that cut deployment from months
    to weeks. Early aggregated benchmarks (anonymized) improve recommendations
    and coaching versus generalist pricing tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pricing managers, sales ops, and branch leaders at paint, varnish, and
    supplies merchant wholesalers who must quote fast and profitably across
    thousands of SKUs, segments, and customer-specific contracts.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile input costs and complex contracts create inconsistent
    quotes and margin leakage. Internal: Manual pricing, overrides, and slow
    approvals frustrate reps and erode confidence. Philosophical: Good customers
    deserve fair, consistent prices—and teams deserve guardrails that prevent
    mistakes.
  guide: >-
    We understand coatings distribution—volatile costs, rebates, and contract
    clauses. Our AI optimizes price lists, enforces contract guardrails at quote
    time, and explains every change with an audit-ready margin waterfall; proven
    in wholesale distribution and built to fit your ERP/CPQ.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/CPQ data (price lists, contracts, costs, win/loss) and
    baseline performance. 2) Configure pricing strategies and guardrails
    (floors, targets, tiers), simulate impact, align stakeholders. 3) Deploy to
    quoting with real-time guidance and margin waterfall; monitor, learn,
    iterate. Pilot in 30 days.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute pricing diagnostic and start a 30-day pilot, or request a
    margin-waterfall demo using your sample data.
  success: >-
    Quotes are right the first time; margins protected without constant
    approvals. Expect 2–5 percentage-point GM uplift, faster quote turnaround,
    fewer overrides, audit-ready contract compliance, and sales buy-in via
    transparent margin waterfalls.
  failure: >-
    Without action: continued margin erosion, contract violations, inconsistent
    discounts, slow error-prone quotes, lost deals, and declining trust from
    customers and the sales team.
