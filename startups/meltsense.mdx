  problem:
    - >-
      Melting/holding furnaces frequently run at elevated superheat or remain
      idling during changeovers and off-shifts, wasting 5–15% of
      fuel/electricity per furnace.
    - >-
      Compressed air systems in die casting plants often leak 15–30% of flow;
      every 1 psi above needed pressure increases energy by ~0.5% with no
      production benefit.
    - >-
      Production schedules are volatile (alloy changes, mold maintenance, short
      runs), making manual furnace scheduling and setpoint management
      error-prone and inconsistent across operators.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time guidance linking energy setpoints to quality
      (porosity, dross formation, cold shuts), so they default to conservative
      temperatures/pressures that raise scrap and energy cost.
    - >-
      Plants have energy data in silos (PLC/SCADA historians, ERP, utility
      meters) without analytics that translate into actionable, time-bound
      setpoint and run/idle decisions.
    - >-
      Rising energy price volatility and carbon reporting pressure (customer
      Scope 3 and emerging regulations) require measurable, auditable savings
      with M&V—something ad-hoc initiatives can’t reliably provide.
    - >-
      Existing OEM or compressor monitoring shows alarms/uptime but rarely
      optimizes cross-asset schedules (melters, holders, compressors) against
      the production plan to minimize idle/overheat time.
    - >-
      Margins are thin; typical plant energy spend is $1.0M–$2.5M/year, yet
      leadership lacks a proven, low-capex path to 8–15% reduction with <6 month
      payback.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play edge gateway connects to furnace PLCs/SCADA, utility meters,
      and compressor controls; ingests production plan from MES/ERP to forecast
      thermal demand per cell/shift.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models predict melt/hold energy vs. superheat,
      door-open time, and alloy; optimizer proposes setpoint schedules and
      on/off/hibernate windows aligned to takt and changeovers.
    - >-
      Compressed air analytics estimate leak rate from off-shift baselines,
      optimize header pressure and compressor load/unload bands, and recommend
      when to stage/trim machines.
    - >-
      Operator Co-Pilot delivers real-time instructions (e.g., reduce holding
      furnace setpoint by 15°C for next 120 minutes; stage compressor B, widen
      pressure band to 6 psi) with quantified kWh/therm savings and quality
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Automated M&V (IPMVP Option C) builds baselines regressed to production
      volume and ambient temperature; weekly savings reports with uncertainty
      bounds and CO2 avoided.
    - >-
      Scenario planner simulates production schedule variants (e.g., overnight
      preheat vs. shift-start ramp) with expected energy impact, cost, and risk
      to cycle time/scrap.
    - >-
      Alerts for abnormal energy intensity (kWh/ton, therms/ton), excessive
      superheat time, abnormal door-open ratios, or leak spikes; integrates into
      existing andon/email/Teams/Slack.
    - >-
      API/Connectors to common MES/ERP (Plex, Epicor, SAP), SCADA historians
      (Ignition, Wonderware), and compressor controllers (Atlas Copco, Kaeser,
      Ingersoll Rand).
