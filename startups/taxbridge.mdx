  problem:
    - >-
      Tax firms spend 15–45 minutes per return rekeying data from
      W-2s/1099s/1098s/K-1s into tax software, creating a seasonal capacity
      bottleneck.
    - >-
      Human data entry introduces 1–3% field error rates that cause rejects,
      IRS/state notices, and rework.
    - >-
      Existing vendor tools are either generic OCR (poor mapping to tax
      software) or locked to a single ecosystem; multi-software firms need one
      pipeline.
    - >-
      K-1s, consolidated 1099s, and brokerage statements have highly variable
      layouts; current tools underperform without expensive templating.
    - >-
      Firms lack an audit trail linking extracted fields to source documents and
      reviewer signoff, complicating workpaper standards and peer review.
    - >-
      Tax seasonality makes staffing expensive; firms need elastic throughput
      (Jan–Apr) without year-round fixed costs.
    - >-
      Security/compliance requirements (SOC 2, IRS e-file security, FTC
      Safeguards) raise barriers to adopting offshore or non-compliant
      solutions.
  solution:
    - >-
      High-accuracy OCR + AI extraction trained on U.S. tax forms (W-2;
      1099-MISC/NEC/DIV/INT/B/SSA/1099-K; 1098-MORT/T/E; 5498; 1095-A;
      consolidated 1099 brokerage; K-1 for 1065/1120S/1041; and common state
      equivalents).
    - >-
      Field normalization and validation (EIN/SSN checksum, state/local wage box
      logic, payer/payee name normalization, address parsing, withholding sum
      checks).
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and exception routing; reviewer UI with side-by-side
      document view, field highlights, tick marks, and audit trail.
    - >-
      One-click export mapped to import templates for Lacerte, ProSeries,
      ProConnect Tax, UltraTax CS, CCH Axcess/ProSystem fx, Drake; JSON/CSV
      exports for others.
    - >-
      Deduplication and client matching across uploads; multi-year carryforward
      of known payers and mappings.
    - >-
      Bulk ingestion via portal, email-in, watch folders
      (ShareFile/SmartVault/Dropbox), TWAIN scanner, and REST API.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop verification option for complex packets (brokerage/K-1)
      with SLAs (e.g., 2-hour standard, 30-minute rush).
    - >-
      Enterprise controls: SSO/SAML, RBAC, PII redaction, data retention
      policies, IP allowlists, detailed access logs, and environment options
      (US-only).
    - >-
      Compliance posture: SOC 2 Type II, encryption in transit/at rest, vendor
      risk program; alignment with IRS Publication 1075 where applicable; FTC
      Safeguards Rule support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy tax source documents into validated, audit-ready workpapers and
    one-click imports to your tax software with 99%+ field accuracy, confidence
    scoring, and human-in-the-loop when needed—cutting 20–40 minutes per return
    while meeting SOC 2 and IRS security expectations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Tax-native extraction with certified, multi-vendor import mappings plus an
    audit-first reviewer UI and elastic human verification—backed by proprietary
    payer/K-1/brokerage datasets and a seasonal operations playbook that
    competitors without tax focus or single-ecosystem tools cannot match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tax and accounting firms who want clean, import-ready workpapers without
    manual data entry.
  problem: >-
    Rekeying W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, K-1s and other tax docs from messy PDFs is slow
    and error-prone, spikes during busy season, and mapping to each software’s
    import template creates review risk and burnout.
  guide: >-
    We understand busy season pressure. Our tax-trained OCR and extraction map
    fields to common tax software (e.g., Lacerte, ProSystem fx/CCH Axcess,
    UltraTax, Drake) with field-level confidence, cross-form checks, encryption,
    audit logs, and onshore processing options to support IRS 7216 obligations.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload docs via portal or API; 2) AI classifies, OCRs, and extracts with
    confidence scores and validations; 3) You review flagged items; 4) Export
    import-ready CSV/XML to your software. Start with a low-risk pilot; no
    long-term contract.
  callToAction: Start a free pilot on sample returns or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Less manual entry, faster prep and review, fewer errors and notices,
    audit-ready workpapers, capacity to handle peak volume, happier clients, and
    higher margins.
  failure: >-
    Continue wasting hours on data entry, introduce errors and rework, miss
    deadlines, burn out staff, and increase compliance risk.
