  title: Demand Forecasting and Restock Scheduler
  description: >-
    Predict depletion by machine/slot and generate service dates and pick-lists
    to avoid stockouts while minimizing visits.
  targetUsers:
    - Operations Manager
    - Route Supervisor
    - Warehouse Lead
  triggers:
    - Nightly batch
    - Low-stock/stockout telemetry event
    - New machine added
  inputs:
    - Slot-level sales history
    - Current inventory/DEX counts
    - Machine constraints (slots/spirals/capacity)
    - Driver schedules and service windows
    - Warehouse inventory and supplier lead times
    - Machine location and access constraints
  steps:
    - Ingest sales/telemetry from VMS
    - Forecast per-slot demand and depletion dates
    - Prioritize machines by risk of stockout and sales impact
    - Build service calendar and combine stops by route/day
    - Generate pick-lists and truck loads; account for capacity
    - Push schedule and picks to VMS/driver app; alert exceptions in Slack/Email
  tools:
    - 'VMS APIs (e.g., Cantaloupe Seed, Nayax, ParLevel, Televend)'
    - Forecasting libs (Prophet/LightGBM/statsmodels)
    - DB/ETL (BigQuery/Snowflake/Airbyte/dbt)
    - Google Maps Distance Matrix or Mapbox
    - Slack/Email webhooks
  outputs:
    - Service calendar per route/day
    - Per-machine order quantities and pick-lists (CSV/JSON)
    - 'Exception list (e.g., high-risk stockouts)'
    - Forecast accuracy dashboard
  pricingModel:
    - Per machine per month
    - One-time data/connector setup fee
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 10
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 9
  risks:
    - Bad/missing slot mappings causing wrong picks
    - Sudden demand spikes (events) reduce forecast accuracy
    - API downtime/rate limits
  dependencies:
    - API access to VMS/telemetry and inventory
    - Driver constraints and calendar
    - Product catalog and slot constraints
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts (snacks, beverages) at high-traffic machines cause lost
      sales and hurt contract retention; operators often estimate demand using
      last-visit sales, leading to 10–25% out-of-stock hours on key SKUs.
    - >-
      Over-servicing routes (fixed schedules) wastes labor and fuel; many
      machines are visited with >50% capacity remaining while true hotspots are
      missed.
    - >-
      Manual pick-list creation is time-consuming and error-prone; drivers often
      overstock slow movers and understock fast movers, increasing spoilage and
      shrink.
    - >-
      Existing VMS tools show sales history but lack accurate slot-level
      forecasts and automated service-date recommendations, forcing planners to
      rely on rules of thumb.
    - >-
      Seasonality, day-of-week effects, school/work calendars, and weather
      shocks are hard to model manually, causing frequent mis-allocations of
      inventory.
    - >-
      Limited telemetry penetration and messy DEX/UCS data create data-quality
      challenges that most operators lack time and skills to address.
    - >-
      Fleet constraints (driver hours, truck capacity, product availability) are
      not integrated into restock planning, creating recurring bottlenecks at
      warehouses and on routes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Slot-level demand forecasts by machine/SKU using sales, capacity, event
      calendars, weather, and location type; updated daily.
    - >-
      Automated service-date recommendations by machine that minimize stockouts
      subject to truck/driver capacity, service windows, and warehouse cutoffs.
    - >-
      Smart pick-lists for each machine/route-day with target quantities by
      SKU/slot, factoring planogram capacity, case sizes, and expiration risk.
    - >-
      Dynamic route scheduling: consolidate or skip low-need machines; flag
      emergencies for high-velocity nodes.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: adjust service days, add/remove machines, change
      product mixes, and see predicted stockout hours, visits, labor, and fuel
      impacts.
    - >-
      Integration layer for DEX/UCS and leading VMS/telemetry (Parlevel,
      Nayax/Televend, Cantaloupe, VendSoft) and route planning tools
      (OptimoRoute, Route4Me, Routific).
    - >-
      Mobile driver mode: simple, offline-capable pick/scan and delivery
      confirmation; capture exceptions to improve models.
    - >-
      Automated KPI dashboard: forecast accuracy, stockout hours, service
      interval adherence, route miles per $ sold, and truck utilization.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut stockouts and route miles with slot-level AI forecasting that
    auto-generates service dates and SKU-level pick-lists, all integrated with
    your VMS/telemetry and route planner. Typical pilots show 20–40% fewer
    stockout hours and 10–20% fewer truck rolls within 60–90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-operator slot-level dataset and normalization layer enabling superior
    forecasts by location type and SKU; constraint-aware scheduler tuned to
    vending-specific realities (DEX quirks, planogram capacities, perishables).
    Deep integrations with leading VMS/telemetry create switching costs and
    deliver faster TTV than generic route planners or in-house spreadsheets.
  customerSegments:
