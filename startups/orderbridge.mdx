leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Non-EDI customers email POs (PDF/Excel), requiring manual entry into ERP;
      average handling time 8–15 minutes/order and 30–60 seconds/line, creating
      bottlenecks during peak periods.
    - >-
      Order entry errors (SKU mismatches, wrong UOM, outdated pricing) cause
      1–3% line-item defects, leading to returns/credits, margin leakage, and
      customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Pricing validation against customer-specific contracts and tiered price
      lists is complex; CSRs rely on tribal knowledge and spreadsheets, raising
      compliance and audit risks.
    - >-
      Service levels require same-day confirmations (often <2 hours); manual
      backlog creates delays, missed ship windows, and lost revenue.
    - >-
      IT teams resist one-off EDI onboarding for small buyers; 40–70% of PO
      volume remains non-EDI across many mid-market wholesalers.
    - >-
      Existing generic OCR/RPA tools are brittle; high maintenance of templates,
      poor SKU normalization, and lack of deep ERP integration lead to low
      straight-through processing (STP) rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest emailed POs from shared inboxes; auto-detect attachments
      (PDF/Excel/Images).
    - >-
      Template-less document AI extracts header, ship-to, line items, UOM,
      requested dates, notes; supports multi-page and multi-PO attachments.
    - >-
      SKU normalization via fuzzy matching, cross-reference tables, alias
      catalogs (brand codes, dealer part numbers), and UOM conversion rules.
    - >-
      Real-time validation against ERP: customer accounts, ship-to, credit hold,
      contract pricing, tax, freight policies, and inventory ATP/lead times.
    - >-
      Confidence thresholds route low-confidence fields to human-in-the-loop
      review queue; learning loops improve models from operator corrections.
    - >-
      Create ERP sales orders via certified connectors; return order
      acknowledgements/confirmations (POAs) to buyers and internal CSRs.
    - >-
      Exception workflows for price discrepancies, discontinued
      items/substitutions, and partial shipments; configurable business rules.
    - >-
      Complete audit trail (who/what/when) with attachments and extracted JSON
      for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn emailed POs into validated ERP sales orders in minutes with >90%
    first-quarter STP, SKU/price-validated accuracy, and audit-ready
    confirmations—purpose-built for office supply wholesalers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized SKU alias graph + contract pricing validation tuned to office
    supplies, combined with certified ERP connectors and a learning loop from
    aggregated, anonymized exception data—delivering higher STP and faster
    onboarding than generic document automation.
