  problem:
    - >-
      Insured document collection for premium audits is slow and inconsistent:
      response rates below 55% within 14 days and 20–45 day cycle times for
      small commercial audits.
    - >-
      Auditor prep is manual: 1.5–3.0 hours per audit spent gathering
      payroll/sales, separating inclusions/exclusions, mapping class codes, and
      building workpapers.
    - >-
      Material leakage from misclassification and missing exposure: 3–7% of
      auditable premium not realized; frequent over/under-billing disputes.
    - >-
      Inconsistent application of bureau/state rules (NCCI, WCIRB, independent
      states) leading to rework and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Poor data quality from PDFs, screenshots, and exports; limited
      integrations with payroll/accounting systems; high back-and-forth with
      insureds.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into pipeline and SLAs across internal and outsourced
      audit teams; weak exceptioning and QA leading to missed deadlines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve secure intake that connects to payroll (ADP, Paychex, Gusto,
      QuickBooks Payroll), accounting (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite),
      time/attendance, and document upload.
    - >-
      AI extraction and normalization of payroll/sales/subcontractor data from
      uploads and system connectors; auto-segmentation of included/excluded pay
      elements (OT premium, tips, severance).
    - >-
      Classification engine that proposes WC and GL class codes using rules plus
      machine learning, with state-specific overrides and auditor-in-the-loop
      validation.
    - >-
      Variance detection across estimated vs actual exposure, prior audits, and
      peer cohorts; flags potential misclassification, uninsured subs, and
      multi-state anomalies.
    - >-
      One-click generation of standardized auditor workbook (Excel) and
      narrative, with audit trail, source links, and evidence attachments.
    - >-
      APIs and prebuilt adapters for Guidewire/Duck Creek to push results and
      support status tracking, QA, and exceptions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut premium audit prep time by 50–70% and total cycle time by 30–50% while
    increasing audit accuracy and recoveries. AuditBridge AI pulls data directly
    from insured systems, auto-maps class codes using bureau/state rules, flags
    variances, and produces a complete auditor workbook in minutes—improving
    insured experience and SLA performance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Combination of a continuously updated bureau/state rules engine,
    insurance-specific labeled datasets from multi-carrier pilots, and deep
    connector coverage across payroll/accounting systems—creating a
    feedback-driven moat where model accuracy and speed improve with each audit,
    alongside enterprise trust (SOC 2, PAS integrations, marketplace
    certifications).

  character: >-
    Premium audit managers at carriers/MGAs and third‑party audit firms (NAICS
    524298) who need clean, complete exposure data without chasing insureds.
  problem: >-
    Manual intake and document wrangling slow audits and create risk: missing
    records, messy payroll/exposure data, mis-mapped class codes, and
    unexplained variances—driving rework, premium leakage, and customer
    friction.
  guide: >-
    We understand audits stall when data is incomplete. Our AI intake and prep
    service collects records from insureds, extracts payroll/exposure, maps
    class codes, and surfaces variances so auditors start from a single,
    accurate workbook.
  plan: >-
    1) Invite insureds via secure link to submit payroll, policy, and GL
    records. 2) AI extracts and normalizes exposures by entity/location and
    auto-maps class codes. 3) You review flagged variances and export a
    ready-to-audit workbook to your system.
  callToAction: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a no‑obligation pilot.
  success: >-
    Standardized, complete intake; faster cycle times; clear exceptions;
    accurate premiums; fewer disputes; and a smoother insured experience.
  failure: >-
    Audits drag while chasing documents; exposures remain inconsistent; class
    codes mismatch; variances go unexplained; disputes escalate; and premium
    accuracy suffers.
