  problem:
    - >-
      Manual route planning takes 60–120 minutes per branch daily and relies on
      tribal knowledge, leading to suboptimal routes and missed service windows.
    - >-
      Drivers spend time locating hard-to-find job sites (new subdivisions,
      rural addresses), causing delays and extra miles.
    - >-
      Contractor customers frequently call for ETAs (WISMO calls), tying up
      counter staff and dispatchers.
    - >-
      Proof-of-delivery (POD) is captured inconsistently (paper tickets, photos
      on personal phones), making it hard to resolve disputes.
    - >-
      Invoice credits and re-deliveries due to incomplete/incorrect deliveries
      create margin leakage (often 1–3% of delivery revenue).
    - >-
      ERP reconciliation is manual and slow; matching PODs to invoices/manifest
      lines is error-prone and delays billing (adds 1–3 days to DSO).
    - >-
      Limited visibility for branch managers into delivery performance (on-time
      %, cost-per-stop, driver utilization) makes it difficult to coach and
      optimize.
    - >-
      SMS/email ETA messaging is ad hoc or absent; customers lack proactive
      updates and delivery photos for jobsite signoffs.
    - >-
      Fleet constraints (weight/length, crane/moffett needs, time windows,
      will-calls) aren’t accounted for by generic routing tools, resulting in
      plan-to-execution drift.
    - >-
      Telematics GPS data isn’t integrated with ERP deliveries; location
      breadcrumbs exist but don’t translate into POD and invoice accuracy.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click route optimization that ingests ERP orders/manifest, applies
      real-world constraints (truck capacity, crane/Moffett need, weight/length,
      time windows), and produces executable routes.
    - >-
      Automatic ETA communication via SMS/email with live tracking links;
      geofenced arrival/departure detection tailored to jobsites and new
      developments.
    - >-
      Driver mobile app (iOS/Android) with offline mode to capture signatures,
      photos, barcodes/QR, and exceptions; photo-to-line-item mapping using AI
      to tag pallets/bundles/serials.
    - >-
      POD-to-invoice auto-reconciliation engine: matches delivered
      items/quantities to ERP sales order/invoice lines; flags discrepancies;
      can auto-hold/unhold invoices and propose credits.
    - >-
      Closed-loop exception workflows: short/over/damage captures, automated
      re-delivery tasks, and return-to-stock/RMA triggers in ERP.
    - >-
      Analytics and KPIs: on-time performance, miles per stop, cost per stop,
      driver/route productivity, WISMO call reduction, credits rate, DSO impact,
      CO2 estimates.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors with major ERPs and telematics to unify order, driver,
      GPS, and inventory data.
    - >-
      Contractor web portal for delivery status, photos, and historical PODs,
      reducing calls and disputes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut delivery costs and credits while delighting contractors: AI-planned
    routes with construction-site ETAs plus automated, line-level POD that
    reconciles directly to your ERP invoice—go from load to cash with fewer
    miles, fewer calls, and fewer disputes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built for building material dealers with deep ERP reconciliation at
    line-item level and construction-site geocoding—combining telematics, POD
    evidence, and invoices into a closed-loop system that generic delivery tools
    and ERP-native modules struggle to match. Early partner integrations and a
    growing dataset of jobsite heuristics improve ETAs and first-time POD
    accuracy over time.
