  problem:
    - >-
      High demand charges from coincident peaks
      (ovens/boilers/compressors/startups) raise electric bills by 15–35% versus
      energy use alone.
    - >-
      Compressed air leakage commonly wastes 20–30% of compressor output; poor
      compressor sequencing and high setpoints increase costs.
    - >-
      Steam system losses from failed traps/insulation cause 10–25% energy waste
      and quality issues (dyeing/curing variability).
    - >-
      Limited submetering and fragmented SCADA/PLC data prevent line-level
      benchmarking (kWh/yd², steam lb/yd²) and root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Production scheduling ignores TOU tariffs and DR events; batch dyeing,
      latex mixing, and curing often overlap, spiking peak kW.
    - >-
      Lack of automated M&V makes it hard to claim utility incentives and build
      investment cases for upgrades.
    - >-
      Operational culture prioritizes throughput; energy optimization lacks
      clear ownership and actionable, real-time guidance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rapid submetering + data integration: install inline power, flow,
      pressure, temperature, and steam trap sensors; connect to
      PLC/SCADA/MES/historians (PI, Rockwell, Siemens).
    - >-
      Process-aware AI models: forecast line-level loads by product style and
      climate; detect anomalies/leaks; estimate savings and CO2 impacts.
    - >-
      Off-peak scheduling optimizer: sequences batch/continuous jobs to minimize
      coincident peaks and respect process/quality constraints.
    - >-
      Utilities orchestration: compressor fleet sequencing and setpoint
      optimization; oven/boiler ramp-rate control respecting throughput/quality.
    - >-
      Steam health: continuous trap analytics, heat loss mapping, and
      prioritized work orders.
    - >-
      M&V and incentives: automated baselining, savings tracking (IPMVP Option
      C), and utility rebate paperwork generation.
    - >-
      Operator workflow: alerts in CMMS (e.g., Fiix, eMaint), dashboards by
      line/area, shift-level playbooks and accountability.
    - >-
      Security and reliability: read-only by default, change-control for
      setpoint pushes, SOC 2 roadmap, on-site buffering for intermittent
      connectivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce total energy intensity by 8–15% and demand charges by 20–40% in 12
    months via mill-specific AI that benchmarks by line/style, detects steam/air
    losses, sequences compressors/ovens, and schedules high-load jobs
    off-peak—verified with IPMVP M&V and integrated with your MES/SCADA.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific AI with line/style-level benchmarks, proven scheduling
    optimizer for batch/continuous carpet processes, and OEM/utility

    benchmark intensity, detect leaks and inefficiencies, and optimize
    schedules—backed by industrial integrations and M&V-ready reporting.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect meters, steam/air sensors, SCADA/PLC, and production schedules.
    2) Baseline and benchmark E/G/S/CA intensity by line and per square yard. 3)
    Detect leaks/inefficiencies and prioritize fixes with savings estimates. 4)
    Auto-schedule high-load jobs off-peak; simulate impact before applying. 5)
    Monitor, alert, and verify savings with clear dashboards and reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute plant energy assessment. Transitional: Request a
    free E/G/S/CA intensity benchmark and peak-risk snapshot.
  success: >-
    Lower demand charges and utility intensity, fewer leaks, smoother
    boiler/steam and compressed-air loads, on-time orders, clear energy KPIs,
    and progress toward cost and sustainability targets—without disrupting
    production.
  failure: >-
    Keep paying peak penalties, leaking cash through compressed air and steam
    losses, risking late orders from energy constraints, missing sustainability
    targets, and eroding margins.
