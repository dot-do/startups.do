  problem:
    - >-
      True constraints on conveyor lines are dynamic and shift with SKU mix,
      changeovers, and upstream/downstream starvation/blockage, making manual
      time studies inaccurate and infrequent.
    - >-
      Micro-stops (5–120 seconds) and speed losses rarely show in SCADA
      summaries or maintenance logs, masking 5–15% throughput opportunity.
    - >-
      Downtime reasons are inconsistently coded in PLC/HMI or not captured at
      all, limiting root-cause analysis and continuous improvement.
    - >-
      OEMs (NAICS 333922) struggle to differentiate equipment and grow
      aftermarket revenue beyond spare parts and time-and-materials service.
    - >-
      Existing OEE solutions are generic; they don’t model conveyors’
      accumulation, merges/diverts, and queue dynamics that determine the real
      bottleneck.
    - >-
      Data accessibility and interoperability are hard (Rockwell, Siemens,
      Beckhoff, Ignition, FactoryTalk, WinCC, Wonderware, Kepware), slowing
      deployments and ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge gateway connects to PLC/SCADA/historians; auto-discovers tags and
      maps to a conveyor state model (run, idle, blocked, starved, fault,
      changeover).
    - >-
      Topology builder models merges, diverts, accumulators, and buffer lengths
      to compute real-time line balance and infer queue states from available
      tags/speeds.
    - >-
      Bottleneck detection engine (TOC-based + time-series) identifies
      constraint machine/zone by minute, with confidence score and contributing
      factors.
    - >-
      Micro-stop classifier merges alarms, speed losses, and starts/stops to
      attribute 5–120s events to causes (mechanical, sensor misreads, mispicks,
      photoeye dirt, jam clearing).
    - >-
      OEE/OLE (Overall Line Effectiveness) with SKU/shift calendars, changeover
      tracking, and speed/loss Pareto tailored to conveyors.
    - >-
      Prescriptive actions: “Increase Zone 17 speed by 5%” or “Extend buffer
      before Case Packer by 3 pallets” with simulated impact and safety limits.
    - >-
      CI workflow: assign actions, track trials (A/B on speeds/accumulation),
      verify gains, and publish kaizen reports.
    - >-
      Integrations: Ignition/FactoryTalk/WinCC, OSIsoft PI, CMMS
      (Fiix/UpKeep/Maximo), MES/ERP (SAP/Microsoft), and OEM service
      portals/APIs.
    - >-
      OEM white-label portal to bundle analytics with new lines and service
      contracts; per-line digital passport and remote monitoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase conveyor-line throughput 5–15% in 90 days using existing PLC/SCADA
    data. Purpose-built AI identifies true constraints, micro-stops, and root
    causes without adding sensors—OEM-branded analytics that creates new
    recurring service revenue.

    templates, and micro-stop libraries) trained on anonymized multi-OEM
    datasets, embedded via OEM white-label agreements and HMI templates—enabling
    faster deployments, higher accuracy, and defensible network effects.

    subtitle: >-
      Find true constraints, micro-stops, and root causes to boost throughput
      and OEE across conveyor fabrication and assembly lines.
    ctaText: Start a 30‑day pilot
    ctaHref: /pilot
  problem:
    - Micro-stops and speed losses hide in noisy PLC data.
    - Shifting bottlenecks mask the real constraint day-to-day.
    - 'SCADA shows status, not root causes or impact.'
    - Manual time studies are slow and miss short idles.
    - Product mix and changeovers distort OEE and cycle times.
    - 'Data is siloed from CMMS/ERP, blocking closed-loop fixes.'
    - Mixed OEM controls make line-wide analytics hard.
    - Teams firefight issues without quantified ROI on actions.
  solution:
    - Ingest PLC/SCADA to auto-detect micro-stops and speed loss.
    - 'Dynamic bottleneck tracking pinpoints the true constraint, live.'
    - 'Root-cause engine correlates faults, interlocks, and sensors.'
    - 'OEE by asset, line, product, and shift—continuously.'
    - What-if simulation quantifies throughput from targeted fixes.
    - Edge processing keeps data on-prem; cloud for scale.
    - 'Rapid connectors for OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, Modbus, SCADA.'
    - ROI reporting ties actions to hours and dollars saved.
  features:
    - 'Plug-and-play: Rockwell, Siemens, Beckhoff, Ignition, AVEVA.'
    - Auto tag discovery and semantic model mapping.
    - Event mining at 10–1000 ms; micro-stop clustering.
    - 'Starved/blocked detection for merges, sorters, palletizers.'
    - Dynamic bottleneck timeline with constraint handoffs.
    - 'Downtime Pareto by cause, asset, and product.'
    - Cycle distribution and performance loss decomposition.
    - Changeover analytics and SMED guidance by SKU/recipe.
    - 'ERP/MES context: work orders, part numbers, routings.'
    - CMMS integration to auto-create work orders with evidence.
    - 'Real-time alerts to Andon, Teams, email with escalation.'
    - Digital twin line model and what‑if scenario planning.
    - 'Role-based dashboards for CI, maintenance, supervisors.'
    - OEM white‑label option for delivered conveyor systems.
  steps:
    - 'Connect: install edge gateway; link OPC UA/SCADA tags.'
    - 'Model: define line topology, buffers, and constraints.'
    - 'Baseline: collect 1–2 weeks; compute OEE and losses.'
    - 'Diagnose: see micro-stop clusters and root-cause drivers.'
    - 'Prioritize: run what‑if; rank fixes by throughput gain.'
    - 'Act: trigger CMMS work orders; set live alerts.'
    - 'Prove ROI: track OEE lift and hours recovered.'
    - 'Scale: template and roll out to other cells and plants.'
