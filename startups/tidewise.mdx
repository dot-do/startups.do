  problem:
    - >-
      Small shellfish vessels lose 1–3 hours per tide cycle due to misjudged
      access windows for launching, crossing bars, and returning before water
      drops.
    - >-
      Safety incidents and near-misses increase around river bars/inlets when
      wind, waves, and ebb tides align (skippers rely on fragmented data and
      local memory).
    - >-
      Manual trip planning consumes 20–40 minutes per outing across multiple
      apps (weather, tides, charts) and radio/harbor reports, leading to errors
      and inconsistent decisions.
    - >-
      Fuel and time are wasted running against currents or making detours due to
      shallow banks and closures (+5–15% trip cost).
    - >-
      Regulatory closures, bio-toxin advisories, and seasonal access rules are
      dynamic and hard to track in the field, risking costly violations.
    - >-
      Co-ops and farms struggle to coordinate crews and boats to tight tide
      windows, causing overtime and missed harvest targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate high-resolution marine weather (wind/wave/visibility), tidal
      heights/currents, river flow, and local hazard feeds into a unified
      forecast for target beds, ramps, and bar crossings.
    - >-
      Compute vessel-specific safe departure/return windows with configurable
      buffers (e.g., 30–60 minutes) based on hull, draft, load, speed curve, and
      known access constraints.
    - >-
      Generate optimized routes that time slack/ebb/flood correctly, minimize
      adverse current exposure, avoid shallow banks/closures, and estimate ETA
      windows for launch, bed arrival, and return.
    - >-
      Provide green/amber/red risk scoring (0–100) for each leg and access
      point, with what-if sliders (departure time, load, route) to trade off
      safety vs. productivity.
    - >-
      Deliver push/SMS alerts when conditions degrade or windows change; support
      offline mode with cached charts, tides, and routes.
    - >-
      Offer fleet tools for co-ops/farms: shared schedules, bed-specific
      thresholds, compliance overlays, and post-trip debriefs to refine local
      models.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plan safe, profitable shellfish runs in minutes: vessel-specific
    departure/return windows and optimized routes that respect tide heights,
    currents, waves, visibility, access rules, and your draft—validated with
    local bar and ramp conditions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Localized access-window intelligence blending public data with proprietary
    skipper feedback, vessel digital twins, and bar outcome histories—hard to
    replicate and improves with each trip; insurer-backed safety programs that
    create switching costs and financial incentives to remain active.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Shellfish captains and small-boat harvesters who want clear, safe go/no-go
    windows and routes to their beds—so they can leave, work, and return on time
    with minimal fuel and risk.
  problem: >-
    - External: Wind, waves, currents, visibility, and tide heights shift fast;
    access channels, bars, and flats are only safe in narrow windows; critical
    data lives in multiple apps.

    - Internal: Tired of guessing, missing tides, or white-knuckling bar
    crossings; second-guessing erodes confidence and crew trust.

    - Philosophical: Working watermen deserve big‑fleet decision tools to fish
    safely and efficiently without gambling with conditions.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: Built with working shellfish captains—we know the pressure to
    make the window and get back before the flats dry out.

    - Authority: AI fused with hyperlocal marine forecasts, tide stations,
    bathymetry, and historical tracks; field‑tested with pilot captains; safety
    practices aligned with USCG guidance.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Set home port, vessel draft/speed limits, crew constraints, and target
    beds.

    2) Optimizer generates safe depart/return windows and routes using wind,
    waves, visibility, currents, and tide heights.

    3) Review simple green/amber/red plan with ETDs/ETAs, slack/current notes;
    run what‑ifs by time, load, or bed.

    4) Get SMS/app alerts as conditions change; export printable plan and GPX.

    5) Log trip; system learns your vessel’s actual timing.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Safety‑first guardrails; you remain in command.

    - Your data stays private; no location sharing without consent.

    - Cancel anytime; not a substitute for official notices or regulations.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14‑day free trial; book a 15‑minute setup call.

    Transitional: Download a sample window report for your harbor; subscribe to
    the weekly Harbor Brief.
  success: >-
    - Hit safe access windows consistently—no more stuck‑on‑the‑flats days.

    - Reduce fuel and idle time; increase on‑bottom harvest hours.

    - Fewer aborted trips and weather surprises; calmer crew and better
    decisions.

    - Accurate ETAs for buyers/tenders; stronger margins and reputation.

    - Clean digital logs for compliance and insurance.
  failure: |-
    - Missed tides, groundings, and risky bar crossings.
    - Wasted fuel, overtime, and lost catch revenue.
    - Crew fatigue, equipment wear, and liability exposure.
