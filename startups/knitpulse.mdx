  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned stoppages from bearing wear, lubrication failures,
      needle/sinker/cam wear, belt slippage, and motor issues cause 5–12%
      production loss in circular/warp knitting machines.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely time-based or reactive; actual machine condition is
      not monitored continuously, leading to premature part changes or
      run-to-failure practices.
    - >-
      Fabric defects (barré, holes, laddering) are often downstream symptoms of
      machine health problems detected too late, increasing scrap and rework.
    - >-
      Spare parts inventory is poorly aligned with actual failure risk; mills
      either overstock (idle capital) or face stockouts (extended downtime).
    - >-
      Mixed OEM fleets (e.g., Mayer & Cie, Terrot, Fukuhara, Karl Mayer) and
      legacy PLCs lack a unified view of health across plants and lines.
    - >-
      Limited skilled maintenance staff and high operator turnover hinder
      consistent preventive maintenance execution.
    - >-
      Existing data (PLC counters, alarms) lacks actionable insights; alarms are
      noisy and not predictive, causing alarm fatigue.
    - >-
      Downtime windows are short and tightly scheduled; without accurate lead
      time-to-failure, planners can’t bundle maintenance efficiently.
  solution:
    - >-
      Retrofit sensing kit: tri-axial vibration + acoustic + motor current +
      temperature and lubrication status; optional oil/grease condition and
      belt-tension sensors.
    - >-
      Edge gateway (IP65) with on-device anomaly detection and buffering for
      low-bandwidth environments; OPC-UA/Modbus connectors for common PLCs
      (Siemens/Beckhoff).
    - >-
      Machine-health models trained on knitting-specific failure modes (needle
      bed wear, cam follower wear, gearbox/bearing degradation, belt slip,
      lubrication starvation, yarn-path resonance).
    - >-
      Predictive workbench: risk scores per subsystem, estimated remaining
      useful life (RUL), recommended actions, and optimal maintenance windows
      aligned to production schedule.
    - >-
      Spare parts forecasting: auto-generate pick-lists by line/shift, safety
      stock recommendations, and vendor lead-time-aware planning.
    - >-
      Integrations: bi-directional with CMMS (Fiix, UpKeep, SAP PM) for
      automatic work order creation/closure; ERP (SAP/Oracle) for parts/PO
      alignment.
    - >-
      Mobile/Operator app: simple traffic-light health, guided checklists,
      photo/video capture, and localized language support (EN/TR/HI/VI/ZH).
    - >-
      Security & compliance: role-based access, data residency options
      (EU/India), and audit logs for ISO/IT compliance.
