    modelCapability: 4.2
    overall: 4.3
  risks:
    - Label quality for defect images

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High scrap/rework rates (typ. 3–10%) on acrylic/FRP/injection-molded
      fixtures driven by multi-factor interactions (resin moisture, regrind %,
      pack/hold, mold temp, cooling, venting, tool wear).
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge dependent; engineers can
      spend hours/days per defect event and still lack statistical confidence.
    - >-
      Process, QC, and vision data are siloed (machines/PLCs, MES, QMS/SPC, lab
      moisture tests, thermal images), preventing end-to-end traceability by
      lot, tool, cavity, and shift.
    - >-
      Inconsistent dimensional quality/leak failures create warranty/returns
      risk and missed OTIF; compliance audits (e.g., ANSI/Z124, IAPMO listings)
      require defensible evidence of process control.
    - >-
      New SKU launches and resin/lot changes cause unstable windows; teams lack
      rapid DOE tools to define robust setpoints.
    - >-
      Experienced technicians retiring; plants struggle to standardize best
      practices and replicate fixes across lines/sites.
    - >-
      Unplanned line stoppages and extended purges during color/material
      changeovers add cost and schedule volatility.
    - >-
      Limited on-site data science capability; generic analytics tools lack
      plastics-specific knowledge and explainability to gain operator trust.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: Connect IMM/thermoforming/FRP line signals (OPC
      UA/EtherNet-IP/Modbus/Euromap), MES/QMS/SPC, lab moisture/viscosity tests,
      and vision systems into a lot/cavity/shift traceability model.
    - >-
      Defect detection/classification: Computer vision models for common fixture
      defects (sink, voids, porosity, blistering, air entrapment, color streak,
      burn/splay, delamination, warpage, leaks) with auto-label assist.
    - >-
      Root-cause ranking: Multivariate ML (causal inference + SHAP) to quantify
      top drivers (e.g., pack pressure, mold temp delta, regrind %, moisture
      ppm, cure/gel times) for each defect mode.
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations: Actionable setpoint and procedure
      suggestions with confidence and expected impact (e.g., "Increase pack
      pressure +80 bar, reduce melt temp −5°C; predicted sink rate −45%"), plus
      maintenance flags (e.g., vent cleaning).
    - >-
      Rapid DOE/what-if: Suggest small A/B or Taguchi experiments, estimate
      sample sizes, auto-generate run cards, and analyze results to lock in
      robust windows.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optional: Send setpoint suggestions to machines for operator
      approval; enforce recipe management and version control with audit trail.
    - >-
      Knowledge capture: Create reusable playbooks by defect/tool/material;
      standardize fixes across lines/sites.
    - >-
      ROI and compliance reporting: Track savings, FPY, Cp/Cpk, false rejects,
      and generate audit-ready control evidence.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut scrap and defects 20–30% in 90 days with explainable, plastics-savvy AI
    that unifies machine, QC, and image data to pinpoint drivers and prescribe
    setpoint and maintenance actions—no machine replacements required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, plastics-specific defect knowledge graph and pre-trained
    CV/analytics models for acrylic/FRP/molded fixtures, plus a proven library
    of prescriptive playbooks and industrial connectors that deliver explainable
    recommendations with minimal data—deployable on air-gapped OT networks and
    validated by measured ROI at lighthouse plants.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and Quality leaders at plastics plumbing fixture manufacturers
    (NAICS 326191) who must improve first‑pass yield and on‑time delivery while
    cutting scrap.
  problem: >-
    External: recurring defects—short shots, warpage, sink, flash, voids,
    weld‑line weakness, leaks, discoloration—driven by shifts in material,
    tooling, and process settings. Internal: teams firefight with tribal
    knowledge and spreadsheets, unsure what to adjust next. Philosophical: your
    data should tell you why defects happen; scrap shouldn’t be the cost of
    doing business.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we’ve lived molding‑line chaos, customer returns, and missed ship
    dates. Authority: polymer‑process and AI team with explainable models that
    fuse QC data, machine parameters, and images; validated pilots and industry
    references; secure cloud or on‑prem deployment.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect QC, machine/SCADA parameters, and images. 2) Run
    the Root‑Cause Analyzer to rank likely drivers and recommend actions
    (settings, maintenance, material, tooling). 3) Pilot on one line, verify
    savings, scale plant‑wide. Agreement plan: no PLC changes, human‑in‑the‑loop
    approvals, data security by design, clear ROI targets.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30‑minute line assessment and start a 4‑week pilot.
    Transitional: download a sample root‑cause report and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Reduce scrap and rework, lift FPY and OEE, stabilize process windows, speed
    troubleshooting and changeovers, cut leaks/returns and chargebacks, document
    decisions for audits/PPAP, and free capacity without new presses.
  failure: >-
    Continue bleeding margin to scrap, overtime, and chargebacks; miss shipments
    and lose capacity; keep firefighting with guesswork; risk customer churn to
    more reliable suppliers.
