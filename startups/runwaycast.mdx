leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Tower and TRACON supervisors must choose and time runway configurations
      under fast-changing weather, traffic mix, and noise rules; decisions are
      often reactive, causing 5–20% throughput drops for 15–45 minutes during
      transitions.
    - >-
      No standard, predictive view of configuration windows exists across
      stakeholders (tower, TMU, ramp/airlines, airport ops), leading to
      misaligned plans, inefficient sequencing, and avoidable taxi/airborne
      holding.
    - >-
      Local rules and constraints (crosswind/tailwind limits, LAHSO/dep-only
      runways, noise abatement, curfew, de-icing pads, work zones) are codified
      in manuals, not machine-usable tools—making consistency and training
      difficult.
    - >-
      Weather forecast uncertainty (wind shifts, LLWS, ceilings/vis,
      precipitation intensity) is not translated into probabilistic, ops-ready
      runway recommendations with rationale and risk bands.
    - >-
      Unplanned or late configuration changes trigger domino effects (frequency
      changes, signage, ground movement plans), increasing controller workload
      and error risk; supervisory staff lack a what-if tool to compare options
      before committing.
    - >-
      Airlines and AOCs lack an authoritative forward view of runway use,
      degrading pushback and de-ice timing, gate/stand planning, and fuel
      planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Site-adapted ML models blend NWP weather, observations, and historical ops
      to predict feasible runway configurations and change windows over a 0–8
      hour horizon with 5–10 minute resolution.
    - >-
      Deterministic timeline plus probabilistic bands (e.g., 10/50/90%
      confidence) for each configuration, showing drivers (wind vector vs
      crosswind/tailwind limits, visibility/ceiling minima, noise rules time
      windows) and constraints (work-in-progress, NOTAMs, de-icing).
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: simulate alternate choices (e.g., stay on south flow 40
      more minutes) and see predicted throughput, taxi time, and risk of
      go-arounds/conflicts under forecast uncertainty.
    - >-
      Machine-readable API feeds A-CDM, TMU dashboards, AOCs; role-based UI for
      tower supervisors with concise rationales and checklist-style constraints.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow with acknowledgement logging and playbooks;
      outputs are advisory-only and designed for safety case approval (traceable
      inputs, versioned models, change control).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Advisory-only, explainable AI that turns forecast weather and local rules
    into precise, probabilistic runway configuration windows and change
    timings—giving supervisors and flow managers 30–60 minutes more lead time
    with a shared, auditable rationale to reduce surprise transitions, delays,
    and workload.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Site-adapted, explainable models and a codified local-rule engine
    co-developed with ATC supervisors, packaged with a reusable safety case and
    certified HMI connectors—lowering buyer risk and integration time compared
    to generic weather tools or bespoke projects.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tower/TRACON supervisors and ATC planners who must select and time runway
    configurations under changing weather and local constraints.
  problem: >-
    Volatile winds, ceiling/vis shifts, and layered LOAs/noise rules make config
    choices risky; late or suboptimal swaps trigger delays, go-arounds, workload
    spikes, and stakeholder friction.
  guide: >-
    Weather-to-Runway Recommender analyzes forecasts and local rules to suggest
    optimal configuration windows with a clear timeline, rationale, and
    constraints—advisory-only, safety-first, and traceable.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect forecast, surface/wind, and rule datasets. 2) Review the
    recommended timeline in your ops display and see the why behind each window.
    3) Confirm or adjust and share advisories with stakeholders.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a demo and run a 60–90 day shadow-mode pilot to quantify impacts
    before going live.
  success: >-
    Smoother banks, fewer last-minute swaps, reduced delays and go-arounds,
    shared situational awareness, defensible decisions, and calmer ops during
    weather changes.

  problem:
    - 'Runway flips are reactive, costly, and increase delay and fuel burn.'
