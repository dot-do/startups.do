  problem:
    - >-
      Kiln and curing/dryer energy is 15–35% of unit cost for brick and 5–15%
      for concrete block; energy waste from suboptimal cycles, idling, and poor
      load planning drives margins down.
    - >-
      Demand charges (often $12–$25/kW-month) spike from simultaneous starts,
      peak-hour operation, or compressed-air/fan ramps add 8–20% to electricity
      bills.
    - >-
      Recipes are fixed or operator-tuned and drift over time with feedstock
      moisture, ambient conditions, and maintenance state—leading to 2–6%
      scrap/rework or quality variability.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs/SCADA, historians, and utility bills; no
      unified baseline for kWh/therms per 1,000 units by SKU, shift, or
      kiln/line.
    - >-
      Limited in-house data science and APC expertise; OEM controls deliver
      stability but not continuous economic optimization vs. tariffs and carbon
      targets.
    - >-
      Capital for new kilns is scarce; plants need software-led, low-capex
      savings with <12-month payback and credible M&V to unlock utility
      incentives.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance concerns (overfires, off-gas, VOCs) deter aggressive
      optimization without guardrails and automated interlocks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: Connect to PLC/SCADA (OPC UA/Modbus), historians
      (PI/AVEVA), meters, and utility billing; normalize to kWh and therms per
      1,000 units and per cycle.
    - >-
      Digital twin + baseline models: ML models for heat-up/soak/cool phases
      that account for load, moisture, ambient temp, fuel quality, and kiln
      health; establish baseline kWh/therms and peak kW.
    - >-
      Cycle optimizer: Recommends dynamic setpoints, ramps, and hold times to
      minimize energy per unit while meeting core specs (strength, absorption,
      warpage).
    - >-
      Peak demand scheduler: Shifts non-critical cycles and high-load ramps
      outside peak windows; coordinates fans, compressors, and autoclaves to
      avoid coincident peaks.
    - >-
      Quality guardrails: Hard constraints on temperature gradients, dew point,
      O2, and pressure; automated interlocks with rollback to safe recipes if
      drift detected.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection & predictive maintenance: Flag fouled burners, leaking
      dampers, failing fan bearings, blocked flues, and sensor drift to prevent
      energy creep and unplanned downtime.
    - >-
      Operator copilot: Role-based UI with playbooks, what-if scenarios, and
      on-shift recommendations; mobile alerts for deviations.
    - >-
      M&V and incentives: IPMVP Option C measurement, weather/feedstock
      normalization, and support to capture utility rebates/retrofit incentives.
    - >-
      Carbon and compliance reporting: Auto-generate MTCO2e per product line,
      ESG rollups, and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut kiln/dryer energy cost 10–20% and demand charges 10–25% in 8–12
    weeks—with guaranteed quality guardrails and third-party verified savings
    (IPMVP) that qualify for utility incentives. No major capex, integrates with
    existing PLC/SCADA.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers and operations leaders at concrete block and brick
    manufacturers who must lower energy spend and demand peaks without risking
    cure quality or throughput.
  problem: >-
    External: Rising kWh/therm costs and demand charges from kiln/dryer peaks;
    inconsistent cycles waste energy and time. Internal: You’re accountable for
    margins, uptime, and quality (strength, absorption, color) and can’t risk
    tinkering. Philosophical: Manufacturers shouldn’t have to choose between
    product quality and energy efficiency.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve run plant-floor projects and understand cure windows,
    moisture profiles, and seasonal swings. Authority: Built by thermal/process
    engineers and data scientists; proven AI optimization on industrial
    kilns/dryers; references, QA guardrails, and secure data handling.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: Baseline interval energy, kiln/dryer logs, production, and
    weather; pinpoint peak drivers. 2) Model: Build an AI twin of your
    kilns/dryers with quality-constrained optimization. 3) Optimize & Prove:
    Pilot schedule/setpoint improvements; verify savings and QC on-line. 4)
    Scale: Roll out, train operators, automate alerts and weekly tuning.
    Agreement: no downtime, QC guardrails, transparent M&V, opt-out at any
    stage.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery call and share a month of data.
    Transitional: Request a sample savings report and the Kiln/Dryer Energy
    Checklist.
  success: >-
    Lower energy use 8–20% and demand charges 10–30% (typical), maintain or
    improve strength/absorption/color, stabilize schedules, increase throughput,
    cut CO2, and gain predictable utility costs with payback in months, not
    years.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means persistent overpayment on energy and peaks, margin erosion,
    missed ESG targets, avoidable quality variability and rework, surprise
    penalty bills, and pressure to spend on unnecessary capex.
