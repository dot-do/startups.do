  problem:
    - >-
      Meeting controlled-impedance targets requires multiple back-and-forth
      cycles between designers and fabricators; typical cycle time is 2–5 days
      per board and 2–4 iterations.
    - >-
      Current tools rarely model real shop capability (press thickness variance,
      copper roughness, resin content spread, plating variability), leading to
      5–15% impedance drift from predictions.
    - >-
      Tolerance analysis is mostly manual or spreadsheet-based; few teams
      quantify yield (Ppk/Cpk) before build, contributing to 5–10% first-article
      failures/respins on high-speed boards.
    - >-
      Material data (Dk/Df vs frequency, glass styles, copper roughness) is
      fragmented across suppliers/datasheets and often out of date or
      lot-inspecific.
    - >-
      Generating accurate, standard-compliant impedance test coupons and stack
      documentation consumes 2–8 engineer-hours per design and is error-prone.
    - >-
      EDA stackup managers and fab CAM tools are not synchronized; data gets
      rekeyed into ODB++/IPC-2581/Allegro/Altium formats, creating mismatches.
    - >-
      Quoting portals often reject or “kick back” impedance builds without a
      manufacturable stackup proposal, delaying time-to-quote by 1–3 days.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI stackup synthesis engine that searches materials, cores/prepregs,
      copper weights, and geometries to meet single-ended/differential targets
      across specified frequencies and layers.
    - >-
      Per-fabricator capability models (press thickness distributions, plating
      profiles, resin content variability, copper roughness models) to ensure
      proposals are actually manufacturable at a specific shop.
    - >-
      Monte Carlo tolerance analysis delivering predicted yield, Ppk/Cpk, and
      guard-banded design rules aligned to IPC-TM-650 2.5.5.x test methods.
    - >-
      Automated, standards-compliant coupon generation (IPC-2221/IPC-2141-style
      guidelines) and export of stack data to ODB++, IPC-2581, Altium, Cadence
      Allegro/Allegro X, and Siemens Xpedition.
    - >-
      Material library ingestion and normalization: Dk/Df vs frequency, glass
      style distributions, foil roughness (Huray/Cannonball), dielectric
      thickness spreads by lot/supplier.
    - >-
      Closed-loop calibration using measured TDR data from coupons to
      continuously refine models per shop and material lot.
    - >-
      Web app and API for designers, CAM, and quoting; optional on-prem/virtual
      private cloud for ITAR or sensitive programs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, fabrication-aware stackup synthesis that hits target impedances
    the first time, quantifies yield before build, and auto-generates compliant
    coupons and stack documentation—reducing stackup iteration time from days to
    hours and cutting first-article impedance failures by >50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, fabrication-specific capability models continuously calibrated
    by real coupon measurements and shop telemetry create a defensible data
    moat; combined with multi-EDA exports and quote-portal embedding, ISTA
    becomes the de facto, shop-validated source of truth for impedance
    stackups—hard for generic solvers or spreadsheets to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    PCB fabrication engineers, CAM, and process planners at bare-board
    manufacturers who must deliver controlled‑impedance stackups, quotes, and
    coupons fast—and right the first time.
  problem: >-
    - External: Tight SE/DI impedance targets, laminate variability (Dk/Df,
    resin content), plating/etch variation, manual calculators, and
    back‑and‑forth iterations slow quotes and risk nonconformance.

    - Internal: Uncertainty and time pressure—fear of missed impedance, scrap,
    and late nights revising stackups.

    - Philosophical: Impedance should be predictable and
    manufacturable—engineers shouldn’t have to gamble with physics or yield.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the tension between impedance, yield, and material
    availability across real fab floors and RFQs.

    - Authority: AI guided by field‑solver physics, vendor laminate libraries,
    and IPC‑aligned methods (e.g., TM‑650); validated with production data.
    Secure by design (on‑prem or private cloud).
  plan: >-
    1) Input: Enter SE/DI targets and tolerances, layer count, material
    constraints, and process windows (etch, plating, roughness).

    2) Generate: Get manufacturable stackups with width/space tables,
    etch/plating comp, sensitivity and tolerance analysis, yield impact, and
    ready‑to‑use impedance coupons (Gerber/IPC‑2581).

    3) Approve & export: Output PDF stackup, traveler notes, IPC‑2581/ODB++
    data, and API handoff to quoting/MES. Agreement: private data stays private;
    cancel anytime.
