  title: Automated Listing Verification and Enrichment
  description: >-
    Continuously verify and enrich company/contact listings using web extraction
    and validation APIs, producing change logs and confidence scores.
  targetUsers:
    - Data Operations
    - Directory Product Managers
    - List Owners
  triggers:
    - Weekly/monthly refresh window
    - Bounce rate threshold exceeded
    - New partner dataset received
  inputs:
    - 'Existing listings (name, URL, address, phone, email)'
    - Source URLs or search queries
    - Previous verification logs
  steps:
    - >-
      Crawl known URLs and search results for official sites (respect
      robots.txt)
    - >-
      Extract contact data (addresses, phones, emails, hours) with LLM-assisted
      parsing
    - 'Validate emails, phones, and addresses via APIs'
    - Cross-check entity against Google Places/OpenCorporates
    - Merge with existing record; compute confidence and change deltas
    - Queue low-confidence conflicts for human review
    - Export enriched dataset and change report
  tools:
    - Playwright/Scrapy
    - 'LLM extraction (OpenAI, Anthropic)'
    - ZeroBounce/NeverBounce
    - Twilio Lookup
    - Smarty/USPS Address Validation
    - Google Places API
    - DuckDB/BigQuery
  outputs:
    - Enriched CSV/Parquet with validation status
    - Per-record confidence scores
    - Change log (adds/updates/deletes)
    - Exception queue for review
  pricingModel:
    - 'Setup fee + per-record verified (e.g., $0.02–$0.08)'
    - Volume discounts
    - Optional monthly SLA retainer

    overall: 5
  risks:
    - Source site TOS/robots restrictions
    - False positives in extraction/merging
    - API rate limits/cost spikes
    - PII handling compliance
  dependencies:
    - API keys for verification vendors
    - Customer-provided source lists
    - Data processing agreement (DPA)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High decay in B2B listings: 20–30% of business/contact data becomes stale
      annually, driving email bounces, returned mail, and customer complaints.
    - >-
      Manual verification is slow and expensive ($0.50–$2.00 per record using
      offshore teams), making continuous freshness economically unviable.
    - >-
      Batch updates create long freshness gaps (30–180 days), while customers
      increasingly expect near-real-time accuracy and change transparency.
    - >-
      Fragmented sources and inconsistent schemas lead to duplicates, conflicts,
      and low confidence in a “source of truth.”
    - >-
      Compliance and risk: ad-hoc scraping, unvetted enrichment vendors, and
      weak audit trails expose publishers to terms-of-service, privacy, and
      deliverability risks.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability: current tools don’t provide evidence links, change
      logs, or confidence scores, undermining editorial trust and customer SLAs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on web extraction with compliance-first crawling (robots-aware,
      rate-limited, identifiable user agent) sourcing official sites and
      authoritative directories.
    - >-
      Multi-layer validation APIs: email (SMTP+reputation), phone
      (line-type+reachability), address (CASS/DPV), website health, hours,
      categories, social links, and key firmographics.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and deduplication across sources to maintain a unified
      profile per business/contact.
    - >-
      Evidence-backed confidence scoring: per-field scores, last-seen
      timestamps, and source-level trust weighting; include evidence
      URLs/snapshots where permitted.
    - >-
      Change detection and audit logs: field-level diffs, confidence deltas, and
      webhooks for client systems; exportable for compliance reviews.
    - >-
      Delivery options: REST/GraphQL APIs, flat-file/SFTP, Snowflake share, and
      turnkey dashboard for QA workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence or high-impact changes, with
      sampling-based quality control.
    - >-
      Operational SLAs, monitoring, and alerting (freshness/coverage drift,
      anomaly detection) with a customer-facing status page.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously verified, enriched, and explainable listings with audit-grade
    change logs and confidence scores—cutting bounce/return rates 25–50%,
    reducing verification cost per record by 70%+, and meeting client freshness
    SLAs without expanding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A longitudinal, evidence-backed change graph accumulated across publishers,
    enabling superior confidence scoring and rapid re-verification of volatile
    fields; proprietary labeled datasets and evaluation harness; and a
    compliance-by-design crawling/validation stack that reduces legal and
    deliverability risk—difficult and time-consuming for rivals to replicate.

      margin.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Directory and Mailing List Publishers (NAICS 513140) who want continuously
    accurate, enriched company/contact listings to protect revenue, trust, and
    usability.
  problem: >-
    External: listings decay quickly—contacts move, domains change, duplicates
    appear. Internal: manual verification is slow, costly, and error-prone.
    Philosophical: publishers shouldn’t have to guess whether their data can be
    trusted.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pain of data rot, refunds, and churn. Our Automated
    Listing Verification and Enrichment uses web extraction, validation APIs,
    and deterministic matching to keep listings current—backed by transparent
    change logs and confidence scores.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect and map sources; 2) Set rules and thresholds; 3)
    Continuous verify/enrich; 4) Review change logs and accept or auto-apply by
    confidence; 5) Sync updates via API/CSV. Agreement: clear SLAs, privacy
    compliance, opt-outs honored, pilot-friendly terms.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and start a pilot on a representative
    segment. Transitional: Request a free data health report with accuracy,
    dedup, and deliverability insights plus confidence scoring.
  success: >-
    Listings stay fresh and complete, deliverability improves, search visibility
    rises, advertiser ROI increases, refunds drop, audit readiness improves,
    teams save time, and new products launch faster.
  failure: >-
    Stale, incomplete listings cause bounced outreach, lost ad revenue,
    subscriber churn, brand damage, compliance risk, and burned-out teams stuck
    in spreadsheets.
