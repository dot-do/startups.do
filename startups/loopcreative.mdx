leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Creative fatigue increases CPA by 15–40% when ads are not refreshed every
      10–14 days; most teams can’t produce variants fast enough.
    - >-
      Manual A/B testing across Meta, Google, TikTok, and LinkedIn is
      time-consuming (5–10 hours/week/account) and error-prone; learnings don’t
      transfer across platforms.
    - >-
      Small and mid-sized teams lack a closed feedback loop tying creative
      elements (copy, colors, layout) to performance; decisions are subjective
      rather than data-driven.
    - >-
      Agencies and freelancers are expensive ($2k–$10k per creative batch) and
      slow (1–2 weeks), limiting test velocity.
    - >-
      Brand and compliance risks: inconsistent assets, off-brand messaging, and
      regional/regulatory constraints (alcohol, finance, healthcare) make scale
      risky.
    - >-
      Marketers struggle to quantify “what works” beyond shallow metrics and
      can’t systematize winning patterns into future ads.
  solution:
    - >-
      Brand-trained generation: ingest brand kit (logo, palette, fonts, tone),
      product catalog, top-performing assets; fine-tune a creative profile per
      account.
    - >-
      Experiment orchestration: create campaigns/ad sets with
      statistically-sound traffic splits; support A/B and multi-armed bandit
      allocation.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: pull hourly/daily performance; auto-promote winners,
      pause losers, and generate next-gen variants from winning features.
    - >-
      Creative DNA insights: quantify which elements (headline hooks, CTAs,
      color schemes, layout, UGC vs. product-only) correlate with performance by
      platform and audience.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop and governance: approval workflows, policy packs for
      regulated verticals, brand safety checks, audit trails.
    - >-
      Integrations and automation: native connectors for
      Meta/Google/TikTok/LinkedIn, Shopify, Segment; webhooks/API for custom
      pipelines; UTM governance and naming conventions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate, launch, and learn: AI that creates on-brand ad variants, deploys
    them to Meta/Google/TikTok/LinkedIn, and automatically iterates using real
    performance data—delivering 15–30% CTR uplift and 10–25% lower CPA in 30
    days, with full brand controls and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, cross-platform performance dataset and Creative DNA models that
    continuously learn transferable winning patterns at the feature
    level—combined with brand-safe guardrails and regulated-vertical policy
    packs. This compounds with each deployment and is difficult for
    single-platform tools or static generators to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      DTC ecommerce brands spending $20k–$500k/month on paid social/display
      (Shopify/BigCommerce).
