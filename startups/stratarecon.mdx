leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inventory write-offs from volumetric errors and scale-ticket mismatches
      (often 2–8% of inventory value per quarter).
    - >-
      Manual/topo surveys are slow, costly ($2k–$10k per count), unsafe (MSHA
      risk), and infrequent (quarterly/annual) causing blind spots.
    - >-
      Siloed data: drone models, scale house data, ERP, and accounting don’t
      reconcile, delaying month-end/quarter-close by 3–10 days.
    - >-
      Variable densities and moisture make volume-to-mass conversion
      inconsistent, leading to over/understated COGS.
    - >-
      Operational decisions (re-handling, loader cycle planning, stockout
      prevention) lack timely, accurate pile-level visibility.
    - >-
      Limited in-house drone/photogrammetry expertise leads to inconsistent
      capture quality and unreliable results.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve portal to upload drone imagery (or integrate with DSPs);
      automated photogrammetry builds geo-referenced 3D models and segments
      stockpiles by material/location.
    - >-
      Volume engine computes per-pile volumes using robust base modeling
      (TIN/plane, toe-finding, breaklines) and uncertainty scoring; supports
      RTK/PPK, GCPs, and LiDAR imports.
    - >-
      Reconciliation engine matches pile-level deltas to scale tickets/ERP
      transactions; flags shrinkage, over-shipments, and mis-coded materials;
      provides audit trails for close.
    - >-
      Density and moisture management: per-material density tables with
      seasonality and lab inputs; adjusts mass estimates with moisture readings
      and weather data.
    - >-
      Integrations and APIs to scale house systems (Apex/Command Alkon, Libra),
      ERPs (SAP, JDE), and data lakes; SSO and role-based access for finance,
      ops, and survey teams.
    - >-
      Exception workflows: discrepancy thresholds, root-cause guidance, and
      approval flows; one-click close pack (reports, roll-forwards,
      adjustments).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Auditable, site-ready stockpile volumetrics with automated reconciliation to
    scale/ERP data, delivering <2% volume error, sub-24h cycle counts, and
    month-end close acceleration by 3–5 days—without adding survey crews.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built reconciliation engine that links 3D volumetrics to
    transactional scale/ERP data with auditable roll-forwards, backed by
    proprietary dataset, capture QA, and finance-grade close workflows—difficult
    for generic drone platforms to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Aggregates operations and inventory managers at sand & gravel/quarry sites
    who must report precise stockpile levels.
  problem: >-
    - External: Piles change daily; manual surveys are slow, risky, and
    inconsistent; volumes rarely match scale/sales data.

    - Internal: Hard to trust the numbers; month-end turns into firefighting;
    stress before audits and leadership reviews.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess what’s on the ground when your
    imagery and scale data can tell you exactly.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pressure of reconciling piles, tickets, and
    production under tight deadlines—without putting people on unstable
    stockpiles.

    - Authority: Built by geospatial/AI engineers for aggregates; proven on real
    sites; integrates with common scale/ERP exports; delivers audit-ready,
    repeatable methods.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Upload your drone imagery (or share a flight folder).

    2) We generate a 3D model, segment piles, and compute accurate
    volumes/changes.

    3) Import sales/scale/production data.

    4) Automated reconciliation quantifies variances, moisture adjustments, and
    shrink.

    5) Review exceptions, approve, and export inventory + variance report to
    ERP.


    Agreement:

    - Start with a one-site pilot and clear success criteria.

    - Transparent per-scan or per-site pricing; cancel anytime.

    - Your data is private and portable; support included.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot scan.

    drone capture checklist; run the ROI calculator.
  success: |-
    - Always-current, audit-ready inventory with clear variance explanations.
    - Safer operations—no more walking piles.
    - Close the month in hours, not days.
    - Fewer write-offs; less working capital stranded in inventory.

    - Consistent, scalable method across sites.
  failure: |-
    - Surprise write-offs, stockouts/overstocks, and rework.
    - Risky manual measurements and liability.
    - Audit findings and eroded credibility.

    - 'Auditors need traceability, not screenshots and spreadsheets.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload drone imagery; AI detects piles and computes precise volumes with
      clean base modeling.
    - Convert volumes to tons using per‑material density and moisture presets.
    - Auto‑reconcile counted inventory with sales/scale data and flag variances.
    - 'Drill into discrepancies by pile, material, date range, and site.'
    - 'Maintain an audit trail—inputs, edits, and approvals are all tracked.'

    - Exports to CSV/Excel/PDF; REST API; integrates with scale/ERP systems.
    - Notifications for large variances and nearing count deadlines.
    - Secure cloud storage and full change logs for audit readiness.
  steps:
    - Capture the site with your drone (standard grid; RTK/GCP optional).
    - Upload images or orthomosaic/point cloud to the platform.
    - Review AI‑detected piles; adjust boundaries and base if needed.
    - Set material density/moisture; auto‑convert volumes to tons.
    - Connect sales/scale data; map materials/SKUs and date range.
    - Review reconciliation; investigate and annotate variances.
    - Approve counts; export reports and push to ERP; schedule the next cycle.
