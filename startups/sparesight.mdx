  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent and lumpy aftermarket demand causes chronic overstock on slow
      movers and stockouts on critical parts, leading to missed SLAs and costly
      expedites.
    - >-
      Lead times are long and volatile (60–240+ days for many critical
      components), making static min/max and spreadsheet MRP settings
      ineffective.
    - >-
      Planners lack installed-base visibility (what equipment is in the field,
      where, and usage conditions), so forecasts aren’t tied to real failure
      drivers.
    - >-
      Service levels are opaque; customers demand 95–99% fill rates, but
      inventory carrying costs are ballooning 15–30% YoY in many aftermarket
      orgs.
    - >-
      Current ERP/MRP settings (manual safety stock, single-echelon rules)
      aren’t suited for sparse demand and multi-depot networks, causing bullwhip
      effects.
    - >-
      Obsolescence and supersessions are frequent due to regulatory changes and
      new product revisions; dead stock regularly exceeds 10–20% of inventory
      value.
    - >-
      Expedite costs (air freight, emergency manufacturing) erode margins;
      backorders trigger penalties and damage OEM reputation.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across ERP, warranty, service, and IoT/usage sources; poor
      master data and lead-time accuracy degrade planning outcomes.
    - >-
      Planner productivity is constrained; each planner may manage 30k–100k SKUs
      with limited time for exception-based intervention.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and harmonize data: sales orders, shipments, returns,
      warranty/claims, service work orders, BOMs/supersessions, lead time and
      supplier performance, ERP/EAM master data, installed-base registers,
      optional IoT/usage.
    - >-
      Map installed base to SKUs: link equipment models/serials to spare parts
      and kits; incorporate criticality, MTBF/MTBR, and maintenance strategies
      (corrective vs preventive).
    - >-
      Forecast demand for intermittent parts: use hierarchical Bayesian,
      Croston/SBA, bootstrap, and survival/hazard models leveraging
      installed-base population, usage profiles, and reliability curves.
    - >-
      Calibrate lead-time distributions: model supplier and logistics
      variability; detect and correct biased lead-time master data.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO): compute service-level-driven
      safety stocks, reorder points, and order quantities across central DCs and
      regional depots under constraints (MOQs, lot sizes, shelf-life, budget).
    - >-
      Policy recommendations: generate s,S or min/max settings by SKU-location,
      with what-if for service level and budget trade-offs; auto-create purchase
      proposals via ERP connectors.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate demand surges, supplier delays, and NPI/EOL
      transitions to test resiliency and cost impacts before committing.
    - >-
      Exception management: rank SKUs by expected stockout risk, FVA
      contribution, and ROI of policy changes; daily/weekly planner workbench
      with acceptance workflow.
    - >-
      Value tracking: continuous KPI dashboards for fill rate, inventory turns,
      carrying cost, expedite spend, dead stock, and forecast value add against
      baselines.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Installed-base and reliability-driven AI that turns sparse parts data into
    precise min/max, safety stock, and reorder policies—achieving 95–99% service
    levels with 15–30% lower inventory and 20–40% fewer expedites, in under 12
    weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific installed-base and reliability modeling for oilfield
    equipment combined with multi-echelon optimization tuned for intermittent
    demand, plus prebuilt ERP/EAM connectors and anonymized industry benchmarks
    that shorten time-to-value and raise switching costs.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Aftermarket, supply chain, and operations leaders at oil & gas field
    machinery OEMs who must hit service levels for installed-base equipment
    without tying up cash in slow-moving, long-tail parts.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile, intermittent demand and long supplier lead times make
    min/max and safety stock guesses unreliable; stockouts cause downtime while
    excess capital sits on shelves and obsolescence grows.

    - Internal: Teams are firefighting with spreadsheets, losing sleep and
    credibility as KPIs slip and expedites spike.

    - Philosophical: Mission-critical operators deserve the right part at the
    right time without waste.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure of balancing uptime commitments with
    inventory risk in lumpy-demand environments.

    - Authority: AI built by supply chain and O&G domain experts that forecasts
    by installed base and optimizes min/max, safety stock, and reorder points;
    standardized onboarding playbooks, enterprise-grade security, and clear
    governance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate ERP/CMMS/IoT and installed-base data (history,
    BOM/equipment hierarchy, lead times, targets).

    2) Calibrate: Segment SKUs, select intermittent-demand models, set service
    policies; validate with backtests and a pilot site.

    3) Operate: Publish replenishment parameters (min/max, safety stock, ROP) to
    ERP; monitor and adapt as demand shifts.

    - Agreement: Data privacy and security controls, change management for
    planners, and an ROI checkpoint after pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and scope a 6–8 week pilot.

    - Transitional: Request a diagnostic using 18–24 months of parts history to
    reveal inventory and service-level opportunities.
  success: >-
    - Consistently hit target service levels across the long tail.

    - Fewer expedites and stockouts; reduced obsolescence; freed working
    capital.

    - Right-sized inventory by site and installed base; continuously updated
    parameters.

    - Teams shift from firefighting to proactive, auditable planning; higher
    customer confidence.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing stockouts, late orders, and costly expedites that erode customer
    trust.

    - Cash trapped in slow movers and write-offs as parts age out.

    - Planners stuck in spreadsheets; missed SLAs and lost aftermarket revenue.

    - A fragile, reactive supply chain that lags market demand.
