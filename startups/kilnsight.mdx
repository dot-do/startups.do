leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High defect escape rates (cracks, warpage, glaze pinholes, color
      non‑uniformity) due to subjective, fatigue‑prone manual inspection on
      fast, dusty lines.
    - >-
      Rule‑based vision systems struggle with color/glaze variability, texture,
      and kiln-induced drift; frequent retuning causes downtime.
    - >-
      Scrap, rework, and warranty returns erode margins; energy‑intensive
      refires amplify cost and CO2 footprint.
    - >-
      Shortage of skilled inspectors; high turnover and training costs;
      inconsistent quality across shifts and plants.
    - >-
      Limited real‑time traceability: difficult to link defects back to root
      causes (kiln zone, lot, die, glaze batch).
    - >-
      Production changeovers (product, glaze, color) cause model drift and
      quality “blind spots.”
    - >-
      Existing AI pilots fail to scale due to data management, MLOps gaps, and
      lack of PLC/MES integration.
  solution:
    - >-
      Model‑in‑a‑Box kit: pre‑trained defect models for clay/refractories + edge
      inference container compatible with NVIDIA Jetson/industrial PCs; ships
      with camera/lighting guidelines and calibration targets.
    - >-
      Data capture & fast pilot: 2‑week pilot using existing cameras or loaner
      kits; guided data collection app; semi‑auto labeling with active learning
      to reach >95% precision/recall for critical defects.
    - >-
      Real‑time deployment: on‑prem edge runtime with <200 ms latency; OPC
      UA/Modbus/TCP outputs to PLCs for reject gates, diverters, and alarms;
      integrates with MES/ERP for lot/traceability.
    - >-
      Adaptive MLOps: drift monitoring, one‑click retraining, model version
      control, A/B testing, and scheduled model updates with rollback; health
      dashboards and SLA monitoring.
    - >-
      Specialized analytics: defect heatmaps by kiln zone/press/glaze batch;
      trend analysis; ROI impact (scrap, rework, energy savings) and Pareto
      reports.
    - >-
      Changeover tools: product/glaze libraries, color calibration workflows,
      golden‑sample management, and recipe‑specific thresholds for multi‑SKU
      lines.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Drop‑in, production‑ready AI that detects cracks, warpage, glaze pinholes,
    and color non‑uniformity in real time, integrates with existing
    cameras/PLCs, and continuously self‑improves—cutting scrap 20–40%, reducing
    manual inspection labor 30–60%, and delivering payback in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain‑specific defect datasets and pre‑trained models for clay and
    refractories, plus proven PLC/MES integration templates that achieve high
    accuracy with minimal labeled data and deploy in under 8 weeks—difficult for
    generalist vision vendors to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and quality leaders at clay building materials and refractories plants
    (NAICS 327120) who need consistent, inline defect detection without slowing
    production.
  problem: >-
    Manual visual inspection misses micro-defects and varies by shift; offline
    checks are slow. Scrap, rework, and returns rise when cracks, warpage, glaze
    pinholes, or color non-uniformity slip through. It shouldn’t be this hard to
    ship defect-free product at full throughput.
  guide: >-
    We understand kiln drift, glaze glare, and forming variability that defeat
    traditional vision. Our team has deployed industrial CV in ceramics and
    heavy manufacturing, integrating with existing cameras, lighting, PLCs, and
    MES for high-accuracy, real-time decisions.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: quick line audit, sample images, and defect taxonomy. 2) Pilot:
    label, train, and validate a Model‑in‑a‑Box; deploy to an edge device with
    operator UI. 3) Scale: calibrate across shifts, integrate via OPC UA/API,
    and set up continuous re‑training and monitoring.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute line audit and share a sample image set. Receive a
    fixed‑price pilot and a go/no‑go report within 4 weeks.
  success: >-
    Automated, consistent detection of cracks, warpage, glaze pinholes, and
    color non‑uniformity. Lower scrap and rework, faster release, traceable QC,
    higher uptime, and confident customer shipments—ROI in weeks, not quarters.
  failure: >-
    Stay with inconsistent manual checks that let defects ship or force costly
    rework, driving scrap, chargebacks, downtime, and eroding margins.
