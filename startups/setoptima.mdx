  problem:
    - >-
      Schedules slip because of excessive setup/lens/light changes, causing
      10–30% downtime per shoot day and overtime penalties.
    - >-
      Shot lists and schedules are built manually in spreadsheets or generic
      software, making it hard to optimize across lenses, lighting plans,
      blocking, talent availability, daylight windows, and company moves.
    - >-
      When variables change on set (weather, talent delays, gear swaps),
      re-ordering shots quickly without missing coverage or continuity is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Lack of predictive insight into time impact of setup changes makes it hard
      to trade off creative choices vs. schedule and budget.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (script breakdown, shot listing, scheduling, call sheets)
      require duplicate data entry and introduce versioning errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest script/shot list from Final Draft, PDF, StudioBinder, Movie Magic,
      or CSV; AI-assisted breakdown to normalize shot types, lenses, lighting,
      locations, and coverage requirements.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimizer that orders shots to minimize setup/lens/light
      changes while honoring continuity, talent availability, daylight/sun
      paths, company moves, locations, and union/permit constraints.
    - >-
      “What-if” sandbox to compare schedules (e.g., different lens sets or
      lighting plans) with quantified time/cost impact before committing.
    - >-
      On-set re-optimization: adjust instantly for delays or creative changes;
      maintain coverage completeness and continuity checks.
    - >-
      Integrations to scheduling/call sheet tools (Movie Magic Scheduling,
      StudioBinder, Yamdu, Scenechronize) and camera metadata (ARRI/RED/Cooke
      /i) for data-driven estimates.
    - >-
      Analytics: predicted overtime risk, variance-to-plan, setup change counts,
      lens swap counts, and cost-of-change dashboard.
    - >-
      Export optimized shot orders, setup groupings, gear lists, and lighting
      plots per scene/day; mobile/offline access for on-set teams.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plan coverage and shoot in the most time-efficient order. SetOptima clusters
    shots by setups, lenses, and lighting, auto-optimizes shot order against
    real constraints, and re-optimizes in seconds when the day changes—cutting
    1–2 hours of downtime per shoot day without sacrificing creative intent.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset linking shot attributes, setup configurations,
    and actual time outcomes across thousands of shoot days—plus real-time
    on-set telemetry from camera/lens metadata—enables more accurate
    optimization than generic scheduling tools. Deep integrations and trusted
    relationships with ADs/DPs and rental houses drive sticky, embedded
    workflows that are hard to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Producers, 1st ADs, and DPs who want fast, predictable shoot days that hit
    schedule and budget without unnecessary resets.
  problem: >-
    Shot lists force constant setup, lens, and lighting changes—creating delays,
    overtime, and stress. Time on set should be spent shooting, not resetting.
  guide: >-
    We know the pain of blown days and crew fatigue. Coverage Planner +
    Shot-Order Optimizer applies scheduling best practices and AI clustering to
    group shots by setup, lens, and light—so you control the day, not the other
    way around.
  plan: >-
    1) Import script/shot list or CSV. 2) Receive an optimized, setup-clustered
    shot order with time and turnover estimates. 3) Review, lock, and export to
    call sheets and schedules—adjust anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free trial to optimize tomorrow’s shoot in minutes, or download a
    sample plan to see it in action.
  success: >-
    Fewer changes and company moves, shorter days, reduced overtime, happier
    crew, more coverage captured, and reliable schedules that protect budget and
    morale.
  failure: >-
    Keep wasting hours on resets, miss shots, pay costly overtime, rush
    performances, burn out your crew, and risk client confidence.
