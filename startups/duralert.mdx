  title: DUR Alert Triage and Prioritization
  description: >-
    Clusters, deduplicates, and prioritizes real-time DUR alerts; recommends
    actions and canned messages for pharmacist review.
  targetUsers:
    - PBM clinical programs
    - Pharmacy operations
  triggers:
    - High-volume DUR alerts from adjudication
    - Threshold of unresolved alerts exceeded
  inputs:
    - NCPDP Telecom DUR segments
    - Member medication history
    - Prescriber data and risk signals
    - Plan DUR policies
  steps:
    - Ingest and normalize DUR alerts
    - Deduplicate recurring alerts and cluster by member/drug
    - 'Risk-rank alerts (severity, history, prescriber risk)'
    - 'Suggest actions (override, outreach, PA) and message templates'
    - Route prioritized queues to reviewers; track outcomes
  tools:
    - NCPDP feed adapter
    - Stream processor (Kafka)
    - Rules engine
    - LLM classification/summarization
    - Queueing (ServiceNow/Zendesk)
  outputs:
    - Prioritized alert queues
    - Suggested actions/messages
    - 'Program KPIs (overrides avoided, outreach)'
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per 1,000 alerts'
    - Monthly subscription for monitoring
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 8
    modelCapability: 6.5
    overall: 7.3
  risks:
    - Missed high-risk interactions
    - Alert fatigue if prioritization poor
    - Integration latency with adjudicator
  dependencies:
    - Real-time alert feed access
    - DUR policy library
    - Reviewer workflow integration
    - Data governance approvals
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Pharmacy benefit processors and PBM clinical teams experience high alert
      volumes (typical 8–20% of claims trigger ≥1 DUR alert), leading to alert
      fatigue and inconsistent resolutions.
    - >-
      Duplicate and cascading alerts across drug–drug interaction, therapeutic
      duplication, dose edits, quantity limits, and opioid safety rules
      overwhelm real-time adjudication and retrospective DUR teams.
    - >-
      Manual triage and outreach (pharmacist calls, faxes, ePA initiation) are
      slow and expensive; average handling time per complex DUR case can exceed
      6–10 minutes, with low acceptance rates for many alerts (<5–10%).
    - >-
      Low signal-to-noise results in member and prescriber abrasion (unnecessary
      rejections/PA requests), appeal rates, and potential noncompliance risk
      with plan safety policies.
    - >-
      PBMs lack cross-client learning to tune alert thresholds and messaging by
      population risk, prescriber behavior, and formulary context.
    - >-
      Existing rule engines lack adaptive prioritization, deduplication, and
      explainable action recommendations; auditability and outcome tracking are
      fragmented across systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Inline AI service that clusters and deduplicates real-time DUR alerts at
      the claim level, ranks by clinical severity, member risk, and cost/impact,
      and returns a prioritized, explainable list.
    - >-
      Action recommendation engine that suggests next best action (auto-approve,
      soft warn, reject with rationale, initiate ePA, pharmacist outreach) and
      generates canned, plan-compliant messages for pharmacist review.
    - >-
      Feedback capture from pharmacist actions and outcomes to continuously
      learn thresholds, prescriber responsiveness, and member risk patterns.
    - >-
      Retrospective DUR module to re-score historical alerts, quantify savings,
      and tune rules before production rollout.
    - >-
      Dashboards for alert load, acceptance/override, abrasion proxies (call
      volume, appeal rate), and ROI by client/plan/drug class.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit layer: immutable logs of alerts, reasoning,
      recommendations, and final decisions mapped to plan policies and NCPDP
      codes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce DUR noise by 40–60% while improving clinical capture and compliance,
    with sub-200 ms inline inference, explainable prioritization, and one-click,
    pre-approved messaging—delivering 15–30% faster case resolution and 20–35%
    fewer unnecessary prescriber/member touchpoints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-client learning on DUR outcomes and abrasion signals, combined with
    inline placement in the real-time adjudication path, enables unique
    prioritization and messaging optimization that rule-based engines cannot
    match. Proprietary feedback loops, explainability tuned for pharmacist
    workflows, and partnerships with knowledgebase/ePA vendors create defensible
    data and distribution moats.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid- to large PBMs (1M–50M lives) seeking clinical efficiency and abrasion
      reduction.
    - >-

      benefits.
    - >-
      Pharmacy switch networks and claims processors seeking value-add modules
      for their clients.
    - >-
      Large specialty pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies handling complex DUR
      workflows.
    - >-
      Utilization management vendors and ePA platforms looking to pre-screen and
      enrich PA with DUR context.

      UM platforms to pre-screen DUR before PA.
    - >-
      Channel through pharmacy management system vendors and switch networks as
      a value-added module.
    - >-
      Thought leadership and clinical validation at AMCP, PBMI, NACDS;
      peer-reviewed case studies with client co-authors.
    - >-
      Targeted ABM for mid-tier PBMs (1–10M lives) and specialty pharmacies
      where ROI is fastest.
  revenueStreams:

      60 days; feedback coverage >30% of alerts for learning.
storyBrand:
  character: >-
    PBM and TPA leaders and clinical pharmacists who must process real-time DUR
    alerts quickly while protecting members, meeting SLAs, and controlling
    costs.
  problem: >-
    External: DUR alerts arrive in bursts—duplicated, conflicting, and
    low-signal—forcing manual triage across systems. Internal: Teams are
    overloaded and worry about missing true risks or failing audits.
    Philosophical: Patient safety and provider trust shouldn’t be sacrificed
    because alerts are noisy.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of nonstop DUR review, audit scrutiny,
    and member impact. Authority: Security-first design aligned to HIPAA/SOC 2
    expectations; built for PBM/TPA workflows; informed by PharmD-reviewed
    rules; API-first with audit-ready logging and interoperability with
    claims/DUR workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely integrate claim/DUR feeds and pharmacist queues. 2)
    Configure: Map priorities, dedup rules, and message templates; set SLAs and
    escalation paths. 3) Launch & Learn: Pilot, monitor dashboards, and iterate
    rules for sustained impact.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30-minute demo. Transitional: Request a pilot on a
    subset of historical claims to see clustering, prioritization, and
    recommended actions/canned messages.
  success: >-
    Streamlined queues with clustered, deduplicated alerts; faster pharmacist
    decisions with recommended actions and ready-to-send messages; clear audit
    trails and SLA adherence; improved member safety and provider experience;
    reclaimed clinical time and lower operational friction.
  failure: >-
    Without change: persistent alert fatigue, missed interventions, SLA
    breaches, higher labor and rework, audit findings, provider complaints, and
    risk to member outcomes.
