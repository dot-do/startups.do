  problem:
    - >-
      High variability in needle coke/pitch/binder lots leads to 2–6% off-spec
      batches, scrapping or rework that costs $80–$300 per ton of finished
      product.
    - >-
      Procurement lacks objective, forward-looking risk scoring for incoming
      lots; supplier COAs are incomplete/lagging and lab tests take 8–48 hours,
      delaying planning and increasing safety stock by 10–20%.
    - >-
      Manual blending relies on heuristics and linear specs, not multi-property,
      non-linear interactions (e.g., sulfur, metals, QI, real density,
      viscosity, softening point, CTE, resistivity), causing conservative blends
      and excess cost (2–5% raw material overspend).
    - >-
      Price volatility in needle coke/pitch (±20–40% YoY) requires dynamic
      re-optimization to preserve margins; most plants only re-plan
      weekly/biweekly.
    - >-
      Quality failures are detected late (post-bake/graphitization), creating
      long feedback loops and weak root-cause traceability across lot genealogy.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across LIMS/COA spreadsheets/ERP/MES; no closed-loop
      learning from outcomes to continuously improve blend recommendations.
    - >-
      Regulatory and customer audits require full lot genealogy and decision
      auditability, which current tools (spreadsheets) cannot reliably provide.
    - >-
      Production planners face complex constraints (tankage, blending
      kinematics, min/max ratios, equipment availability, energy limits) not
      captured in current planning tools.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration layer connecting LIMS (lab tests), supplier COAs, ERP/MES
      (inventory, purchase lots), and process historians; automated data quality
      checks and unit harmonization.
    - >-
      Probabilistic conformance-risk models per property (e.g., CTE,
      resistivity, density, porosity, ash/sulfur/metals, QI, viscosity/softening
      point), calibrated by plant and product family; Brier score and
      calibration monitoring.
    - >-
      Prescriptive blending optimizer: risk-adjusted, multi-objective (cost,
      yield, energy, risk of non-conformance), honoring process constraints
      (min/max ratios, tankage, equipment/line capacity, temperature windows,
      blend homogeneity).
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if analyses for supplier mix, price changes, spec
      tightness, and demand; marginal value-of-quality to support negotiations.
    - >-
      Active-sampling recommendations: suggest minimal extra lab tests to reduce
      uncertainty on high-impact lots before blending decisions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: tie batch outcomes (post-bake/graphitization QC)
      back to inputs for continuous model improvement and supplier scorecards.
    - >-
      Lot genealogy and audit trail: end-to-end traceability from supplier lot
      to finished product with explainable feature contributions.
    - >-
      Deployment options: customer VPC or on-prem; SSO, RBAC, API-first
      architecture; change management playbooks and training for planners/QA.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut off-spec risk and raw-material spend with explainable AI that scores
    each incoming lot and prescribes the least-cost, constraint-feasible blend
    to hit property targets—proven 2–5% raw-material savings and 20–40%
    defect/hold reduction within 90 days, with full lot genealogy and
    auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    lot–outcome data and encoded with real plant constraints, delivered with
    rapid integrations to LIMS/ERP/MES and a performance-based pricing option

  character: >-
    Process, quality, and plant leaders at carbon and graphite manufacturers who
    must deliver on-spec electrodes/anodes/parts at the lowest possible cost.
  problem: >-
    Volatile needle coke/pitch/binder lot properties create hidden conformance
    risk; teams rely on trial-and-error blending, tribal knowledge, and slow lab
    cycles—causing scrap, over-blending, missed shipments, and margin loss.
    Making spec shouldn’t be a gamble.
  guide: >-
    Supplier Lot Risk Scoring & Prescriptive Blending is your materials-AI
    guide—built by carbon/graphite and data-science experts, validated in
    production, integrates with LIMS/ERP/MES, and is transparent, auditable, and
    secure.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historical and live LIMS/ERP/MES data; 2) AI scores each lot’s
    conformance risk by recipe and simulates cost-optimal blends to meet
    targets; 3) Push prescriptive blend ratios and release decisions into your
    workflow with human override and change tracking.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and start a 6-week pilot using 12–24 months of lot and
    QC data to quantify savings, or request a sample risk-and-blend report.
  success: >-
    Consistently hit spec at least cost; reduce variability, scrap, and rework;
    accelerate lot release; strengthen supplier leverage and planning; increase
    throughput and margins.
  failure: >-
    Continue guessing blends and over-specifying to be safe—leading to spec
    excursions, rework and downgrades, customer complaints, missed shipments,
    and eroded profitability.
