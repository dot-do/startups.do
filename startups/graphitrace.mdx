  problem:
    - >-
      Yield losses (often 2–8% of throughput) and costly rework/scrap in
      carbon/graphite processes (calcination, baking, impregnation,
      graphitization, machining) are driven by multi-factor interactions that
      are hard to diagnose across siloed ERP/MES/LIMS/furnace data.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis for defects such as porosity variability, cracks,
      breakage, ash/impurity excursions, and resistivity out-of-spec typically
      takes days to weeks and relies on tribal knowledge, delaying containment
      and burning energy on bad batches.
    - >-
      Batch genealogy is fragmented: linking raw coke/pitch lots, furnace loads,
      impregnation cycles, recipes, and lab results is manual, error-prone, and
      not auditable at scale.
    - >-
      Unstable raw material quality and furnace variability (zone temperature
      gradients, soak times, vacuum levels, gas flows) cause drifts that go
      undetected until final inspection—too late to intervene.
    - >-
      Customers face growing traceability and compliance demands (e.g.,
      automotive/EV, aerospace, nuclear) but lack a single, queryable provenance
      and CAPA trail across systems.
    - >-
      Existing analytics/BI/APM tools are generic, lack a domain-specific data
      model for carbon/graphite, and stop at dashboards rather than
      prescriptive, shop-floor-ready actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors and data model to ingest ERP (orders, lots), MES
      (recipes, schedules), LIMS (lab results), historians/PLCs/SCADA (furnace
      telemetry) into a governed, audit-ready batch genealogy graph.
    - >-
      Domain-specific ML pipeline combining multivariate time-series anomaly
      detection with explainable attribution (e.g., SHAP) to quantify each
      factor’s contribution to yield loss and defects.
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks mapped to common failure modes in carbon/graphite
      (e.g., binder ratio drift → adjust impregnation cycle; zone 3 soak deficit
      → re-bake decision) with expected yield impact and risk scoring.
    - >-
      What-if simulation for recipe and schedule changes (e.g., soak time, ramp
      rate, load configuration) using physics-informed constraints to avoid
      unsafe recommendations.
    - >-
      Closed-loop actions via APIs to MES/recipe management and digital standard
      work: suggest holds, rework routes, or furnace setpoint adjustments with
      approvals and e-signatures for compliance.
    - >-
      Automated compliance/traceability: end-to-end genealogy queries
      (lot→furnace→test→shipment), CAPA linkage, and audit-ready reports for ISO
      9001/IATF 16949 customers.
    - >-
      12-week ROI-focused pilot methodology with measurable success criteria
      (e.g., ≥2% scrap-cost reduction or ≥50% faster RCA) and change-management
      toolkit.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    genealogy graph, rapidly pinpoints yield-loss drivers, and recommends
    verified corrective actions—cutting scrap 15–30%, improving first-pass yield
    1–3% absolute, and reducing time-to-root-cause from days to hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    carbon/graphite, trained on cross-plant labeled datasets and furnace
    telemetry, enabling explainable, prescriptive insights that generic
