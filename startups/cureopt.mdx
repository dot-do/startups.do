  problem:
    - >-
      Energy intensity is high and variable: ovens and post-cure stages are
      often over‑heated and slowed to protect quality, inflating kWh per kg by
      10–30%.
    - >-
      Setpoints are static or manually tuned; changes in recipes, density,
      humidity, mold temperature, and throughput cause under/over‑cure and
      scrap.
    - >-
      Limited in‑line visibility of cure state/end‑point leads to conservative
      buffers (time/temperature) that reduce throughput and increase energy use.
    - >-
      Operators lack real‑time, recipe‑aware guidance; knowledge is tribal and
      shifts vary in performance.
    - >-
      No standardized kWh/kg benchmarking across product families and lines;
      difficult to prove savings or qualify for utility incentives.
    - >-
      Existing PLC logic cannot multi‑objective optimize (quality + energy +
      throughput) under operational constraints.
    - >-
      Energy and carbon reduction targets (e.g., ISO 50001, Scope 2) are hard to
      hit without risking first‑pass yield.
  solution:
    - >-
      Instrument and integrate: pull PLC/SCADA tags (oven zones, conveyor RPM,
      airflow, moisture), recipe/MES data, QA outcomes; optional add‑on sensors
      (IR pyrometers, thermal cams, humidity).
    - >-
      Model the cure: train line‑specific ML models to predict cure
      end‑point/quality proxies (e.g., hardness, density uniformity, compression
      set) from process conditions and material inputs.
    - >-
      Constrained optimizer: compute optimum zone setpoints, cure window, and
      conveyor speed per recipe and ambient conditions to minimize kWh/kg
      subject to quality/throughput constraints and safety limits.
    - >-
      Closed‑loop deployment: operator decision support or auto‑apply via PLC
      with guardrails, interlocks, and roll‑back; A/B testing to validate gains.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: continuous kWh/kg tracking by product family; savings
      vs. baseline with weather/throughput normalization; utility incentive
      documentation.
    - >-
      Change management: operator training, SOP updates, recipe library
      management, and governance for setpoint changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce oven energy intensity (kWh/kg) by 10–20% within 90 days while
    maintaining or improving first‑pass yield and throughput. Closed‑loop,
    recipe‑aware optimization that recommends or auto‑applies safe setpoints and
    conveyor speeds with verification of savings (IPMVP‑aligned), delivering
    <6‑month payback per line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Foam‑specific cure models and datasets enabling recipe‑aware, closed‑loop
    optimization with proven M&V—difficult for horizontal analytics vendors to
    replicate. Pre‑built PLC/MES connectors and OEM partnerships shorten
    deployment from months to weeks, and safety‑validated guardrails enable true
    auto‑optimization rather than dashboards alone.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, process/quality engineers, and sustainability leaders in
    urethane and other foam manufacturing (NAICS 326150) who want to cut kWh per
    kg and CO2e while protecting cure quality and throughput.
  problem: >-
    - External: Ovens/hot rooms are energy-intensive; ambient and load
    variability drives drifting setpoints; complex SKUs force wide cure margins;
    manual tuning wastes energy.

    - Internal: Tightening cure windows feels risky; limited data-science
    bandwidth; constant pressure to hit cost and decarbonization targets without
    hurting yield.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between energy efficiency and
    product quality.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam curing. Our team combines ex-foam process engineers and
    ML experts; we’ve optimized thousands of oven-hours across slabstock,
    molded, and integral-skin lines. Proven energy cuts with zero quality
    escapes, secure plant-ready deployment, and compliance with your QA and
    change-control processes.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect: Ingest oven zone temps, conveyor speeds, line load,
    ambient/humidity, and QA data via PLC/SCADA/MES.

    2) Calibrate: Build physics-informed models and a cure digital twin; encode
    quality constraints per SKU/recipe.

    3) Optimize & Pilot: Run shadow-mode recommendations for validation; then
    enable operator prompts or closed-loop setpoint/speed control.

    4) Scale: Roll out to more lines; monitor KPIs; continuous model refinement.

    Risk & safety:

    - Guardrails never recommend outside qualified cure windows; hard limits +
    human approvals.

    - Change control, validation reports, and instant rollback to prior
    settings.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute line assessment; start a 4-week pilot on one oven.

    Transitional: Get a free baseline kWh/kg and CO2e report; download the Cure
    Optimization Readiness Checklist.
  success: >-
    - 10–25% reduction in kWh/kg while meeting or tightening cure specs.

    - Maintain or improve first-pass QA and dimensional/physical properties.

    - Fewer overcure dwell times; optimized conveyor speeds increase effective
    throughput 5–15%.

    - Lower CO2e, clearer path to ESG targets, and a recipe-by-recipe optimized
    SOP library.

    - Confident operators with data-backed recommendations and alarms before
    drift.
  failure: >-
    - Keep burning excess kWh with conservative setpoints and long dwells.

    - Risk under/overcure, scrap, rework, and customer returns.

    - Miss delivery and ESG targets; justify unnecessary capex instead of tuning
    what you have.

    - Remain dependent on tribal knowledge with no repeatable cure strategy.
