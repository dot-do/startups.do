leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, generic checklists don’t reflect site-specific scopes of work
      (SOW), leading to inconsistent quality and client complaints.
    - >-
      Inspection schedules are ad hoc; missed or late inspections increase risk
      of SLA penalties and lost contracts.
    - >-
      Supervisors spend 2–6 hours per new site building checklists from scratch
      and chasing standards/compliance requirements.
    - >-
      No unified audit trail; proof of service and compliance documentation is
      fragmented across spreadsheets, PDFs, and messaging apps.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into trends (recurring deficiencies, problem areas,
      inspector performance) prevents targeted coaching and continuous
      improvement.
    - >-
      Onboarding new supervisors/inspectors is slow; tribal knowledge isn’t
      codified into reusable templates.
    - >-
      Existing tools either require heavy manual setup or are not tailored to
      janitorial industry standards (CIMS, OSHA, CDC, Joint Commission, ISO
      cleanroom, FDA Food Code).
    - >-
      Clients increasingly demand data-backed QA reports and risk-based
      inspection cadences; many BSCs cannot deliver consistently.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests SOWs, floor plans, and industry standards to auto-generate
      room- and task-level checklists with risk-weighted scoring.
    - >-
      Smart scheduler proposes inspection cadences by risk/traffic/compliance
      profile and auto-updates based on performance data.
    - >-
      Mobile inspections app (iOS/Android) with offline mode, photo/video
      capture, GPS/time stamps, and corrective action workflows.
    - >-
      Compliance mapping: links each checklist item to relevant standards (ISSA
      CIMS, OSHA, CDC, Joint Commission, ISO 14644, FDA Food Code).
    - >-
      Client-facing portal for proof of service, trend dashboards, and
      corrective action status.
    - >-
      Integrations with workforce/timekeeping and CMMS tools; push tasks,
      receive incident data, and consolidate reports.
    - >-
      Analytics: deficiency heatmaps, recurrence tracking, inspector
      performance, MTTR for corrective actions, and SLA risk alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate compliant, site-specific inspection checklists and smart cadences
    from your SOW in minutes. CleanScope AI aligns to industry standards,
    automates scheduling and reminders, and produces audit-ready reports that
    reduce rework, prevent SLA penalties, and win renewals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A standards-mapped, janitorial-specific SOW-to-checklist engine trained on
    thousands of real SOWs and inspections, coupled with compliance libraries
    and risk-based scheduling. Network effects improve recommendations as more
    sites and corrective actions are logged. Deep integrations with BSC
    workflows and franchise white-labeling create switching costs.
  customerSegments:

      Building Service Contractors (BSCs) with 20–2,000 employees managing
      multi-site commercial cleaning contracts.

      high-risk areas.
    - >-
      Manufacturing, pharma, and food processing plants with GMP/ISO/FDA-driven
      cleaning requirements.
    - >-
      Property managers of office, retail, and mixed-use portfolios who demand
      SLA reporting from BSC vendors.
    - >-
      Roles: operations directors, QA/inspections managers, area supervisors,
      EVS managers, compliance officers, franchise ops.
