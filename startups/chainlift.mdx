  problem:
    - >-
      Manual title search/exam takes 45–120 minutes per file, creating
      bottlenecks in high-volume centers and slowing cycle times.
    - >-
      Examiner variability leads to inconsistent exceptions/requirements and
      higher rework/QA costs.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: title plants, county clerk/recorder sites, and private
      databases require multiple logins and formats; copying text introduces
      errors.
    - >-
      Labor costs are rising while order volumes are cyclical, making staffing
      for peaks inefficient and expensive.
    - >-
      Existing production systems (e.g., SoftPro, RamQuest, Resware, Qualia)
      don’t natively perform reliable AI extraction and drafting for Schedules
      A, B-I, B-II.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit requirements (ALTA Best Practices, SOC 2) demand
      traceability and explainability that manual processes struggle to document
      consistently.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified search: federated connectors to title plants and county record
      systems with automated instrument retrieval.
    - >-
      AI chain-of-title abstraction: classify instruments (deeds, mortgages,
      liens, judgments, easements, HOA), normalize grantor/grantee, and build
      ownership chain with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Automated Commitment drafting: generate Schedules A, B-I (requirements),
      and B-II (exceptions) with citations to source documents and rationale
      text for examiner review.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: inline redlines, rationale inspection,
      versioning, and approval routing back to production systems.
    - >-
      Risk flags and coverage insights: highlight potential gaps (e.g., missing
      releases, breaks in chain, legal description ambiguities) and suggest
      remediation steps.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance: immutable audit trails, model decision logs, and
      exports aligned to ALTA Best Practices and SOC 2 requirements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce title search/exam time by 50–70% and standardize commitment drafting
    with auditable, explainable AI that integrates directly with title plants,
    county records, and production systems—improving examiner throughput,
    consistency, and compliance without changing underwriter risk controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, multi-jurisdictional knowledge graph linking
    instruments, parties, parcels, and prior commitments—continuously improved
    via examiner feedback and grounded by clause libraries validated by
    underwriters—combined with deep integrations into title plants and
    production systems that reduce switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations leaders, chief title officers, and underwriting managers at
    direct title insurance carriers (NAICS 524127) who need to scale examination
    capacity while protecting accuracy, compliance, and margins.
  problem: >-
    External: fragmented county indexes/title plants, manual chain-of-title
    abstraction, inconsistent commitments, tight SLAs. Internal: backlogs,
    rekeying, hiring/training bottlenecks. Philosophical: Producing a defensible
    commitment shouldn’t take days or guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the risk of missed liens, curative delays, and loss-ratio
    impact. Our team of title professionals and data engineers built an AI
    workflow that searches title plants and county records, abstracts the chain
    of title, and drafts Schedules A, B-I, and B-II—always examiner-in-the-loop
    with traceable rationale and alignment to underwriting guidelines.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data sources and underwriting rules; 2) Pilot on historical and
    live orders to benchmark accuracy and tune thresholds; 3) Go live with
    examiner review, QC dashboards, and continuous model improvement.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a limited-scope pilot.
    Transitional: Request a sample commitment with audit trail and an
    ROI/throughput model.
  success: >-
    Shorter commitment turn-times, higher examiner throughput, fewer curative
    issues, lower E&O exposure, standardized Schedules A/B-I/B-II, clear audit
    trails for regulators and reinsurers, and scalable coverage across new
    counties without proportional headcount.
  failure: >-
    Persistent backlogs and overtime, missed encumbrances and exception drift,
    blown closing dates, higher post-closing cures and claims, audit findings,
    and margin erosion.
