  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts on high-velocity SKUs during seasonal spikes (e.g.,
      back-to-school) cause 3–8% lost sales and damaged key-account SLAs.
    - >-
      Inventory imbalances across DCs (excess in one, shortages in another)
      drive avoidable LTL transfers and expedite freight (8–20% of transfers are
      value-destructive).
    - >-
      Manual allocation for constrained SKUs (spreadsheets, priority codes)
      leads to misallocation, higher backorders, and revenue leakage from
      chargebacks and cancellations.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/WMS allocation rules are static; they ignore real-time order
      mix, gross margin, service commitments, and freight cost trade-offs.
    - >-
      Poor visibility into true transfer economics (handling + linehaul +
      service impact) results in over-transferring or late decisions.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks measurable, scenario-based recommendations to balance
      fill rate, margin, and freight cost simultaneously.
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine that recommends DC-to-DC transfers weekly/daily,
      factoring demand, on-hand, transfer cost, lead times, and service targets.
    - >-
      Constrained allocation optimizer that assigns limited inventory to open
      orders to maximize revenue/margin impact and SLA adherence while
      minimizing expedite freight.
    - >-
      Scenario planner to test policies (e.g., prioritize key accounts, margin
      tiers, ship-complete vs. partial) and quantify trade-offs in minutes.
    - >-
      One-click execution: push approved transfers/allocation decisions back to
      ERP/WMS/TMS as transfer orders, picks, or order holds/releases.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring: detects new imbalances and high-risk orders;
      proposes micro-rebalances before problems escalate.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: business-rule overlays and reason codes for every
      recommendation; audit trails for compliance and change management.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut backorders 20–40% and freight spend 8–15% within 90 days by using AI to
    rebalance DC inventory and allocate scarce stock to the highest-value
    orders, with automated, auditable recommendations that plug directly into
    your ERP/WMS/TMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized optimization tuned for stationery/office supplies: seasonality
    patterns, kit/substitution logic, key-account SLA rules, and true transfer
    economics. Library of prebuilt connectors (Epicor P21, Infor, D365,
    NetSuite, Manhattan, Blue Yonder) enables 6–8 week time-to-value.
    Explainable recommendations with auditable reason codes build trust and
    accelerate adoption.
