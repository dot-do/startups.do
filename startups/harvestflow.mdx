leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Combines, carts, and trucks are rarely synchronized; 15–35% of truck time
      and 10–25% of combine time is idle during harvest due to misaligned
      dispatching and variable yield rates.
    - >-
      Hourly harvest output fluctuates with crop conditions (moisture, variety),
      micro-weather, terrain, and machine settings—manual radio/text
      coordination cannot predict these shifts in real time.
    - >-
      Under/over-dispatch causes costly queues at field edges and elevators
      (10–45 minutes typical per load), overtime, and missed delivery
      appointments.
    - >-
      Current tools (spreadsheets, radios, generic TMS) lack ag-specific
      forecasting, field access constraints, and offline operation; they don’t
      optimize for moisture thresholds, bin capacities, or elevator line times.
    - >-
      Larger farms and custom harvesters must juggle multiple combines across
      different fields and receivers, with different distances and access roads,
      driver HOS constraints, and variable unloading speeds.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across OEM telematics, ELD/GPS, weather, and elevator
      systems; there’s no unified real-time planning layer specialized for
      harvest logistics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: ingest combine/cutterbar throughput, grain flow,
      moisture, GPS, telematics from OEMs (Deere, CNH, AGCO, CLAAS), truck
      GPS/ELD, elevator queue APIs, weather/micro-forecasts, field boundaries,
      road speeds, and bin capacities.
    - >-
      Forecasting: ML models predict hourly cut rate (tons/bushels per hour) per
      combine and per field, adjusting for moisture, slope, operator behavior,
      and weather nowcasts; goal: <12% MAE on hourly output.
    - >-
      Optimization: a field-aware dispatch engine solves vehicle routing with
      time windows, driver HOS, private farm roads, elevator capacity, and
      moisture/quality constraints; updates schedules continuously as conditions
      change.
    - >-
      Operational apps: mobile, tablet, and web apps for dispatchers, combine
      operators, and drivers—offline-first with automatic resync; voice prompts
      and large-button UI for in-cab use.
    - >-
      What-if planning: simulate adding/removing trucks, changing receiver,
      splitting fields, or shifting start times to visualize queues, throughput,
      and overtime impact before committing.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance: consider HOS where applicable; geofenced speed
      limits and access; alerts for unsafe staging or predicted night operations
      beyond policy.
    - >-
      Integration and APIs: connectors to John Deere Operations Center, CNH AFS,
      AGCO FUSE, Trimble, Raven; ELDs (Samsara, Motive, Geotab); elevator/scale
      systems (Bushel, Agris) where available; CSV/manual fallback.
    - >-
      Change management: onboarding playbooks, field-level SOP templates, radio
      call scripts, and real-time “coach” tips (e.g., suggest staging at
      different headland) to drive adoption.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict hourly harvest output per machine and auto-dispatch trucks/bins to
    cut wait and idle time by 30–50%, increase combine utilization by 8–15%, and
    deliver an ROI within the first harvest season—without changing your
    existing equipment or workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Harvest-specific optimization and a growing proprietary dataset of
    combine-throughput-to-dispatch outcomes and elevator queues enable more
    accurate short-horizon forecasts than generic fleet or farm software.
    Offline-first, voice-guided workflows and field-road-aware routing are
    tailored to real-world harvest conditions, backed by ROI-verified case
    studies and deep OEM/ELD integrations.
