  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, inconsistent triage of beneficiary distribution requests leads to
      long cycle times (median 2–5 business days) and elevated operational risk.
    - >-
      Trust officers spend 1–3 hours per request cross-referencing trust terms
      (HEMS/discretionary standards), beneficiary eligibility, liquidity, and
      tax implications.
    - >-
      Documentation is fragmented across trust instruments, amendments, account
      notes, and DMS, making audit-ready decision memos slow to produce and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Regulatory expectations (12 CFR 9, OCC fiduciary guidance, SR 11-7 model
      risk management, GLBA) require robust, consistent processes with traceable
      rationale.
    - >-
      Liquidity/tax impacts are often modeled late or inconsistently, leading to
      avoidable realized gains, DNI/throwback issues, or suboptimal in-kind vs.
      cash distributions.
    - >-
      Institutional knowledge is concentrated in senior officers; turnover
      creates training gaps and inconsistent outcomes.
    - >-
      Existing trust platforms handle workflow/accounting but lack AI-driven
      interpretation of trust terms or committee-ready memos with
      evidence-linked citations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest trust instruments (and amendments), beneficiary requests, account
      holdings/cash, and policies via API/connectors.
    - >-
      Extract and structure relevant trust provisions (HEMS, ages/conditions,
      spendthrift, distribution authority, co-trustee requirements) with
      evidence-linked citations.
    - >-
      Triage each request for completeness, eligibility, potential conflicts,
      and policy triggers; route to appropriate approval path.
    - >-
      Model liquidity/tax impact: cash availability, proposed sale lots,
      estimated realized gains/losses, DNI/K-1 implications, state fiduciary tax
      exposure, withholding needs.
    - >-
      Generate a decision package: risk score, recommended action
      (approve/deny/partial/alternative in-kind), scenario analysis, and a
      committee-ready memo with citations and policy alignment checklist.
    - >-
      Maintain an auditable trail (who saw what, when; model prompts/outputs;
      human edits) aligned to OCC/FDIC/FRB expectations.
    - >-
      Integrate into existing workflows (trust accounting, DMS, CRM,
      e-signature) and provide human-in-the-loop review with standard SLAs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut discretionary distribution decision times by 50–70% while improving
    regulatory defensibility: AI reads the trust, validates requests against
    terms, models liquidity/tax impact, and generates a committee-ready memo
    with evidence-linked citations and a clear recommendation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A regulatory-grade, evidence-linked trust term parser and decision memo
    generator trained on a proprietary corpus of annotated trust documents and
    committee memos, combined with built-in model risk governance and deep
    integrations to trust ops systems—hard for generic AI or workflow vendors to
    replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      US bank trust departments (national, regional, community banks) handling
      personal trusts, estates, foundations, and agencies.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Trust officers, fiduciary administrators, and custody teams who want faster,
    defensible beneficiary distribution decisions without bottlenecks or
    compliance risk.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual triage, scattered documents, unclear trust terms, and
    unknown liquidity/tax impact slow decisions and burden committees.

    Internal: Teams feel exposed to errors and second‑guessing; beneficiaries
    feel ignored or confused.

    Philosophical: Fiduciary decisions should be timely, transparent, and
    grounded in the governing instrument.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand every distribution decision must withstand scrutiny,
    document the rationale, and honor the trust’s purpose.

    Authority: Built with fiduciary, tax, and compliance input; policy-as-code
    rules map to common standards; audit-ready workflows integrate with existing
    approval processes.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest & Interpret: Capture request details, governing documents,
    parties, assets; extract relevant trust terms (HEMS, powers, constraints).

    2) Analyze & Validate: Check request against terms; model liquidity and tax
    impact (cash, DNI, basis, 65-day election considerations); flag risks and
    required approvals.

    3) Prepare & Route: Generate a committee-ready decision memo with options,
    rationale, drafts of minutes/beneficiary letters, checklists; route for
    approval and archive with an audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a limited-scope pilot (3–5
    trusts).

    Transitional: Download a sample decision memo and compliance mapping
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Faster, consistent decisions; clear documentation and audit trails; reduced
    legal/compliance exposure; improved beneficiary communication; better tax
    and liquidity outcomes; more time for high‑judgment client work.
  failure: >-
    Slow, inconsistent decisions; audit findings and fiduciary risk; beneficiary
    complaints or litigation; tax leakage and avoidable costs; reputational
    damage from opaque or delayed processes.

  problem:
    - Manual review of lengthy governing documents slows every request.
    - Inconsistent interpretations lead to uneven beneficiary outcomes.

    - Automated triage turns unstructured requests into clear cases.
    - AI reads governing documents and maps requests to trust terms.
    - 'Built‑in checks surface eligibility, restrictions, and conflicts.'
