leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High density variability (CV often 5–8%) drives off-spec blocks, rework,
      and scrap (2–6% typical)
    - >-
      Cycle times are set conservatively to avoid defects, inflating steam and
      cooling costs and constraining throughput
    - >-
      Operator- and shift-dependent know-how causes recipe drift across lots,
      shifts, ambient conditions, and bead grades
    - >-
      Bead variability (supplier-to-supplier, lot-to-lot, moisture, pentane
      content) changes behavior of standard recipes
    - >-
      Limited safe experimentation: trying new setpoints risks bead collapse,
      poor fusion, or dimensional instability
    - >-
      Data sits in silos (PLC/SCADA, historian, QC lab, MES), making root-cause
      analysis and continuous optimization slow
    - >-
      Energy costs (steam, compressed air, vacuum) are significant and growing;
      no simple way to co-optimize quality and energy
    - >-
      Existing OEM recipes/controls don’t learn over time or adapt to raw
      material and environment changes
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: non-intrusive edge connector streams PLC/SCADA tags
      (steam pressure/time, vacuum/cooling time, mold temp, fill time, air
      flow), historian, and QC lab data (density, fusion score, compressive
      strength)
    - >-
      Multivariate learning: models map setpoints + context (bead grade/lot,
      moisture, ambient temp/humidity, mold/tool, shift) to quality, scrap risk,
      and cycle time
    - >-
      Setpoint recommender: suggests incremental, safe tweaks (e.g., -2 s steam,
      +3 s vacuum, -0.1 bar steam pressure) with expected impact on density CV,
      scrap probability, and cycle time
    - >-
      Guardrails and safety: hard constraints on OEM limits, steam
      pressure/temperature, vacuum, and de-mold windows; product-spec
      constraints ensure no recommendations that risk fusion or dimensional
      stability
    - >-
      What-if sandbox/digital twin: simulate predicted outcomes before applying;
      run A/B or time-boxed experiments with automatic post-run analysis
    - >-
      Closed-loop readiness: start in advisory mode with operator approval;
      optional API to write back to PLC via existing change-management workflow
    - >-
      Continuous learning: automatic re-training by bead lot and seasonality;
      drift detection alerts when models need attention
    - >-
      Operator UI: shift-level guidance, recipe comparisons, and one-click
      acceptance; audit trail of applied changes for compliance
    - >-
      KPI tracking: real-time density distribution, CV, scrap, energy/part,
      cycle time; weekly savings report vs. baseline
    - >-
      Deployment: on-prem/edge-first with secure cloud for fleet learning; works
      with Siemens/Rockwell/Beckhoff and common historians
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    days—via safe, operator-approved setpoint recommendations that learn from
    your lines, your bead grades, and your environment. No major capex; deploy
    at the edge with guardrails that respect OEM and safety limits.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Process engineers and production leaders at EPS foam plants who want
    consistent density and fusion, faster cycles, and less scrap without risking
    a bad run.
  problem: >-
    - Villain - guesswork and drift in pre-expander and molder setpoints

    - External - density variance, fusion defects, long cycles, energy waste,
    scrap

    - Internal - fear of tweaks, constant firefighting, pressure to hit specs
    and schedule

    - Philosophical - data should drive safe decisions, not tribal knowledge or
    luck
  guide: >-
    - Empathy - we know the steam, vacuum, fill, aging, and cooling tradeoffs
    are real-time and unforgiving

    - Authority - AI learns relationships from your historical runs, uses
    guardrails and constraints, explains predicted impact, and keeps an audit
    trail
  plan: >-
    - 1 Connect - integrate PLC/MES/CSV data and define specs, limits, and
    constraints

    - 2 Learn - model setpoint-to-quality relationships and simulate safe
    what-if scenarios

    - 3 Recommend - serve in-shift setpoint adjustments with predicted outcomes,
    monitor SPC, refine

    - Agreement - you approve every change, no uncontrolled PLC writes, data
    stays in your environment
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct - schedule a 30-minute discovery and sample data import

  problem:
    - 'Density varies across lots, shifts, and seasons'

    - Data sits in PLC/SCADA with no closed-loop learning back to setpoints
  solution:
    - >-
      Learns relationships between setpoints (steam, expansion time, fill,
      vacuum, cooling) and quality/scrap from your history
    - 'Recommends safe, small parameter adjustments per machine, mold, and SKU'
    - Always respects constraints and machine limits with built-in guardrails
    - 'Shows predicted impact on density variance, cycle time, steam/water use'
