  problem:
    - >-
      Cotton growers and crop advisors struggle to translate multi-page soil and
      tissue lab reports into clear, in-season N and K actions; format
      variability and timing make manual interpretation slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Suboptimal N/K timing during squaring to peak bloom reduces lint yield and
      fiber quality; late or excess N can delay maturity and increase vegetative
      growth, while K deficiencies drive micronaire penalties.
    - >-
      Field variability (texture, residual N, prior crop, irrigation
      differences) makes blanket rates wasteful; generating variable-rate
      prescriptions mid-season is time-consuming and requires GIS skills many
      advisors lack.
    - >-
      Existing decision tools are generic or corn-focused and rarely fuse tissue
      diagnostics, imagery, weather, and phenology for cotton-specific
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Missed application windows (weather/logistics) and lack of confidence in
      lab thresholds lead to inaction; growers want quantified recs with
      risk/uncertainty and clear ROI.
    - >-
      Retailers and labs need scalable, defensible interpretations to attach to
      reports and retain advisory relationships; they lack a cotton-specialized
      engine.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of soil and tissue reports (PDF, CSV, XML/EDI) from
      leading labs; parsing, QC, and normalization to cotton-specific
      sufficiency ranges by growth stage.
    - >-
      Phenology-aware engine that fuses tissue sufficiency, soil supply,
      NDVI/biomass trends, weather, and yield goal to recommend in-season N and
      K rates, timing, and form (e.g., foliar K vs. dry K2O topdress).
    - >-
      Zone creation from imagery and historical yield to generate variable-rate
      N/K prescriptions; exports in shapefile, ISOXML, and Ops Center formats.
    - >-
      Decision support with uncertainty bands and “do nothing” thresholds to
      avoid unnecessary passes; includes urgency scoring by field and optimal
      application window based on forecast and field accessibility.
    - >-
      Advisor workflow: batch interpret 100s of reports, flag critical fields,
      push recs to growers for approval, and create work orders for ground rigs
      or aerial.
    - >-
      Outcome tracking: log actual applications, rec vs. applied delta, and
      yield/fiber quality to close the loop and continuously improve
      recommendations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cotton-specific AI that turns lab reports, imagery, and growth stage into
    precise, timed N and K recommendations and ready-to-apply variable-rate
    prescriptions—cutting decision time from days to minutes and improving yield
    and fiber quality with measurable ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cotton-only recommendation engine trained on multi-year, multi-region
    paired datasets (soil+tissue+imagery+as-applied+yield) with validated
    on-farm trials, combined with deep lab integrations that competitors lack;
    produces machine-ready VRA prescriptions and uncertainty-aware timing
    windows tailored to cotton phenology.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Progressive cotton growers and agronomists who want confident, in‑season N
    and K decisions for every field and growth stage.
  problem: >-
    - external: Lab reports, imagery, weather, and growth-stage data are
    scattered and hard to translate into rates and timing.

    - internal: You’re unsure if today needs a side‑dress, foliar K, or
    nothing—and you can’t afford to be wrong.

    - philosophical: With all this data, in‑season nutrition shouldn’t be
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    - empathy: We know mid‑season cotton nutrition is time‑compressed and
    high‑stakes; a missed window costs yield and quality.

    - authority: Built with cotton‑specific models, CCA‑reviewed heuristics, and
    validated against multi‑year field trials and lab datasets; integrates major
    labs and imagery providers.
  plan: >-
    - process: 1) Connect labs, fields, and imagery; 2) AI fuses soil/tissue,
    NDVI, growth stage (PHS, first bloom, peak bloom, boll fill), weather,
    texture, and yield goal; 3) Receive per‑field N/K rates, timing, and VRA
    maps with confidence and ROI.

    - agreement: Transparent assumptions and units; recs aligned to regional
    guidelines; data ownership retained; easy export to equipment.
  callToAction: >-
    - direct: Start a 14‑day trial and upload your latest soil/tissue report.

    - transitional: Download a sample recommendation and ROI calculator; book a
    20‑minute setup call.
  success: |-
    - Right rate, right time N and K by field and growth stage.
    - More lint per pound of N; stronger fiber from adequate K.
    - Improved boll fill and timely cutout.
    - Fewer rescue passes and tissue alarms.
    - Documented, audit‑ready decisions and VRA maps.
    - Lower input waste and environmental loss.
  failure: >-
    - Over/under‑application causing rank growth, fruit shed, weak fiber, or
    yield loss.

    - Missed application windows at PHS/first bloom/peak bloom.

    - Wasted fertilizer, extra passes, and compliance risk.

    - Lab reports sitting unused; decisions made on gut feel.

  problem:
    - Lab results don’t say how much to apply or when.
    - >-
      Cotton needs shift quickly from squaring to boll fill—timing windows are

      fiber quality.
    - Field variability makes flat rates wasteful and risky.
    - >-
      Data is scattered across PDFs, portals, maps, and notes—hard to act on
      fast.
    - >-
      Missing weather and imagery cues leads to mistimed passes and avoidable
      loss.
