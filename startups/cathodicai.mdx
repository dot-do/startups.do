  problem:
    - >-
      Integrity teams struggle to unify CP survey data (CIS, DCVG/ACVG),
      rectifier logs, soils/resistivity, and ILI results housed in different
      systems (ESRI/PODS, PI/SCADA, vendor portals), delaying risk decisions by
      weeks.
    - >-
      Dig lists are often created using heuristics and static risk matrices,
      leading to low hit rates (e.g., <30% actionable findings per dig) and high
      field costs per confirmed defect.
    - >-
      Rectifier drifts/outages and seasonal soil effects go undetected or
      unmodeled, creating blind spots that increase likelihood of external
      corrosion and regulatory exposure.
    - >-
      Audit preparation for PHMSA/State inspections (49 CFR Part 192 Subparts I
      & O) is manual and time-consuming (5–20 days/operator) due to scattered
      evidence and limited traceability of risk decisions.
    - >-
      ILI-CP alignment is error-prone (chainage, spatial referencing, tool clock
      alignment), causing false positives/negatives in corrosion growth
      assessments.
    - >-
      Limited ability to quantify consequence and prioritize digs near
      HCAs/MCAs, populated areas, water crossings, and class-location changes
      reduces risk-reduction per maintenance dollar.
    - >-
      Operators cannot easily simulate “what-if” scenarios (e.g., rectifier
      adjustments, bond changes, coating rehab) to forecast risk reduction and
      ROI before field work.
    - >-
      Insights are not field-ready; GIS outputs are not consistently formatted
      for alignment sheets, mobile maps, and work management systems, slowing
      execution.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion connectors for CP datasets (CIS, DCVG/ACVG, PCM),
      rectifier logs (SCADA/PI, remote monitors), soil/resistivity maps, coating
      type/age, ILI (MFL/UT/SCC), and PODS/APDM GIS.
    - >-
      Data quality and alignment engine: snap-to-route, clock alignment of ILI
      runs, chainage normalization, de-duplication, survey gap detection, and
      unit normalization.
    - >-
      Physics + ML risk scoring: combines NACE/AMPP criteria (e.g., -850 mV
      polarized potential, current attenuation), soil corrosivity indices,
      coating condition proxies, rectifier performance, and historical digs to
      estimate likelihood of external corrosion and expected growth rate.
    - >-
      Consequence modeling overlays: HCAs/MCAs, class location, diameter/MOP,
      crossings, population and environmental sensitivity to compute risk =
      likelihood x consequence at segment-level (e.g., 50–500 ft bins).
    - >-
      Targeted dig/repair prioritization: produces ranked dig lists with
      expected defect severity, probability of actionable find, and
      risk-reduction-per-dollar, plus crew-ready work packages.
    - >-
      Rectifier optimization: detects outages/drifts, simulates effect of
      setpoint changes/bonds on protection coverage, and recommends adjustments
      to reduce risk and field visits.
    - >-
      GIS and work execution outputs: map layers (ESRI), alignment sheets, and
      integration with Maximo/SAP/Primavera for scheduling and closeout.
    - >-
      Audit-ready traceability: auto-generated evidence packs linking data
      sources, model explanations (SHAP-style feature attributions), and
      decision logs for each priority call.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Physics-informed AI that fuses CP surveys, rectifier telemetry, soils, GIS,
    and ILI to deliver ranked, audit-ready dig/repair priorities and GIS
    outputs—improving dig hit rates by 2x and cutting unnecessary digs by 25–40%
    while meeting PHMSA/CSA requirements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Fusion of physics and ML validated against multi-operator dig outcomes, plus
    ready-made connectors into CP/ILI/GIS/telemetry ecosystems and audit-ready
    traceability aligned to PHMSA/CSA—creating a defensible data network effect
    and regulatory credibility that is hard to replicate.
