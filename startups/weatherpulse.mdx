  problem:
    - >-
      Demand for outdoor power equipment (OPE) is highly weather-driven (first
      mowable weekend, first snow, windstorms), yet most dealers react late,
      missing sales spikes by 24–72 hours.
    - >-
      Dealers run generic campaigns not aligned to hyperlocal weather, leading
      to wasted ad spend and low conversion rates.
    - >-
      Staffing is fixed or gut-based; service check-in lines and parts counters
      get overwhelmed during weather events, causing long wait times, lost
      tickets, and poor CX.
    - >-
      Inventory is seasonal and bulky (mowers, blowers, generators, snow
      throwers). Poor timing creates overstock or stockouts and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Co-op marketing funds from OEMs go unused or are spent inefficiently due
      to compliance and claim friction.
    - >-
      Dealers lack integrated tooling to trigger email/SMS/ads and staffing from
      a single weather-aware plan tied to local zip codes and store hours.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: dealers can’t easily measure sales lift from
      weather-triggered actions or forecast labor needs by department.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weather-triggered orchestration: auto-launch ads, emails, and SMS when
      local thresholds are met (e.g., first 1–3" snow forecast, 3+ consecutive
      dry days >60°F, wind advisory >25 mph).
    - >-
      7-day staffing suggestions by department (sales floor, parts, service
      check-in) using weather forecasts and historical POS/service data.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware creative: promote SKUs you actually have; shift to
      services/parts if key SKUs are low or out of stock.
    - >-
      Co-op compliant templates and automated proof/claim packets to maximize
      OEM reimbursement.
    - >-
      Cross-channel templates for common events (first mow, storm prep, fall
      leaf cleanup, winterization, first freeze, hurricane watch) with regional
      nuance.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: tie campaigns to POS SKU categories (mowers, blowers,
      chainsaws, trimmers, generators, snow throwers) and service tickets; A/B
      test and holdout measurement.
    - >-
      Quiet hours and TCPA compliance for SMS; dayparting aligned to store hours
      and weekend timing.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations with DMS/POS, website/CMS, email/SMS, and ad
      platforms.
    - >-
      Multi-location controls: per-store triggers, budget pacing, and creative
      localization.
    - >-
      On-call managed service option for creative and ad ops during
      severe-weather windows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn local weather into revenue: automated, hyperlocal campaigns and
    staffing plans that lift same-store sales 8–15% during weather events while
    reducing labor overtime and wait times.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, SKU-aware weather triggers and staffing forecasts trained
    specifically on OPE dealer data, combined with co-op-compliant creative and
    deep DMS/POS integrations—difficult for horizontal weather-ad tools or local
    agencies to replicate.

  character: >-
    Outdoor Power Equipment retailers (NAICS 444230) who want to capture
    weather-driven demand without guessing when to market or staff up.
  problem: >-
    Weather is hyperlocal and unpredictable, causing sudden spikes around rain,
    heat, first snow, and storms; teams can’t monitor 24/7, so ads and SMS hit
    late, budgets misfire, and floors are under- or over-staffed.
  guide: >-
    We understand OPE seasonality; our AI watches hyperlocal forecasts and sales
    patterns, then aligns ads, email/SMS, and staffing; trusted by OPE dealers
    and integrated with Google/Meta, Klaviyo/Twilio, and POS/workforce tools.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect locations, product lines, ad and messaging accounts, and staffing
    calendar; 2) Set weather triggers and templates (rainfall, heat index,
    snowfall, storm alerts) and labor rules; 3) Approve or auto-run as AI
    launches campaigns, adjusts budgets, and sends staffing suggestions; no-risk
    pilot and full control to pause anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot for one store;
    Transitional: Get a free Weather Impact Report and OPE playbooks for your
    ZIP codes.
  success: >-
    Timely campaigns hit before demand spikes, stores are staffed right,
    seasonal SKUs sell through, overtime drops, customers are happier, and
    revenue and labor efficiency rise measurably.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing at the weather and you’ll miss demand surges, waste ad spend,
    frustrate shoppers with long lines, and watch competitors win your market.
