  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected drift in yarn evenness (U%, CVm%), hairiness (H), and
      tensile/elongation causes off-quality lots and customer claims; mills
      often discover issues hours/days later during lab checks or at customer
      end.
    - >-
      Data silos between USTER Tester/Quantum clearer logs, AFIS, tensile
      testers, bale laydown data, and environmental (RH/temperature) records
      prevent fast root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Existing tools are retrospective (reports/dashboards) rather than
      proactive; line operators and QA teams lack actionable early warnings tied
      to specific machines/lots/shifts.
    - >-
      Manual SPC and sampling frequency (e.g., 1 cone per 2–4 hours) miss
      sub-hour drifts; a single hour of drift on a 25k–50k spindle section can
      scrap 150–400 kg of yarn.
    - >-
      Quality losses of 0.3–1.0% and claims/write-offs of $50k–$250k per
      incident are common; mills lack quantified, standardized KPIs to
      continuously drive down these losses.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in and partial coverage (only one OEM’s data) limit analytics;
      multi-OEM mills can’t get a unified quality view across sites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from USTER Tester/Quantum, AFIS, tensile/elongation
      (e.g., Statimat/Tensojet), MES/ERP lots, bale laydown/recipe, and RH/temp
      sensors via a secure edge gateway + cloud.
    - >-
      Streaming anomaly detection using mill-specific statistical baselines and
      ML models (seasonality-aware) to detect drifts in U%, CVm%, IPI
      (thin/thick/neps), hairiness, tensile/elongation, clearer cut-rate,
      spectrogram faults.
    - >-
      Root-cause engine correlating drift to lot (bale mix), machine/position,
      traveler hours, drafting roller wear, clearer limit changes, RH/temp
      excursions, shift/operator; ranks likely causes with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts to WhatsApp/Teams/SMS and HMIs with prescriptive checks
      (e.g., “Inspect ring frame 3, positions 40–64; traveler age > 30 hours; RH
      dropped from 55% to 48%”).
    - >-
      Digital SPC with auto-control limits, drift-trend visualization, and
      recipe/lot comparisons across mills; alarm fatigue suppression via
      relevance/priority logic.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard quantifying prevented scrap/claims, MTTA/MTTR, stability by
      line and product family, with before/after baselines for audits and
      customer trust.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Proactive, vendor-agnostic early-warning that detects and explains drifts in
    evenness, hairiness, and tensile/elongation within 15–30 minutes, ties them
    to lot/machine/environment causes, and reduces off-quality and claims by
    30–50% in year 1—without changing machines or recipes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of labeled drift events across mills
    (vendor-agnostic) plus prebuilt connectors and prescriptive playbooks
    enables faster, more accurate root-cause and measurable ROI than
    OEM-specific dashboards or generic analytics. Hybrid edge architecture
    reduces latency and deployment friction in low-connectivity mills.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality, production, and mill managers at fiber, yarn, and thread mills who
    must keep quality stable, shipments on-spec, and waste low.
  problem: >-
    Quality drifts in evenness, hairiness, and tensile/elongation often go
    unnoticed until lots fail or customers complain. USTER and lab data stays
    siloed; linking deviations to lot, machine, or environment causes is slow
    and manual.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run mills and built analytics on USTER/lab data. Our AI catches subtle
    drift early and explains it in mill language—backed by proven deployments,
    benchmarks, and secure, IT-friendly setup.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect USTER, lab, and production data (no sensor changes). 2) Baseline
    normal and monitor drift by lot/machine/environment. 3) Receive prioritized
    alerts with root-cause traces and recommended actions. 4) Weekly review to
    lock in improvements.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 30-day pilot on one or two lines.
  success: >-
    Hold CVm, hairiness, and tensile within tight bands; cut off-quality and
    rework; trace issues to exact lots/machines; act hours earlier; protect
    margins and delivery dates; strengthen customer trust.
  failure: >-
    Keep flying blind—more off-spec lots, rework and scrap, line stops, late
    shipments, chargebacks, and eroded margins.
