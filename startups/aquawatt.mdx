  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected leaks, fouling (e.g., RO membranes, heat exchangers), and
      compressed-air losses cause 2–10% waste in water and energy, but plants
      rarely spot issues before KPIs drift significantly.
    - >-
      Plants monitor totals (kWh, m3) but lack line/SKU-normalized intensity
      (kWh/m3 and m3/1,000 bottles), making it hard to identify true anomalies
      vs. mix effects or ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Manual analysis across SCADA/PLC, historians (e.g., PI), and CMMS is slow;
      root cause investigations take days and are often inconclusive.
    - >-
      Production changes (speed, SKU, bottle size, resin %, ambient temperature)
      create shifting baselines that defeat static alarms/control limits.
    - >-
      ESG and regulatory pressure requires auditable intensity reduction and
      event logs; current reporting is manual and lagging.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from process drift (e.g., membrane failure, chiller
      inefficiency) leads to scrap, rework, and missed orders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud data pipeline integrates flow meters, energy meters, line
      sensors, production schedule/ERP, and historian tags; normalizes to kWh/m3
      and m3/1,000 bottles per line/SKU/shift.
    - >-
      Multivariate anomaly detection (seasonal baselines, change-point
      detection, isolation forests) using context (line speed, bottle size,
      ambient temp, resin %, maintenance state).
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks map anomaly signatures to likely causes (e.g.,
      rising RO dP, compressor duty cycling, blow molder oven zoning) with
      priority, safety notes, and step-by-step checks.
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflow: push corrective actions to CMMS (SAP PM, Maximo)
      with severity, parts list, and estimated savings; track MTTR and verify
      post-fix intensity regression to baseline.
    - >-
      What-if and ROI calculator quantifies savings for accepted actions;
      ongoing benchmarking across similar lines/sites identifies best practices.
    - >-
      Automated ESG/CSR-ready intensity reports with traceable event logs and
      variance explanations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
