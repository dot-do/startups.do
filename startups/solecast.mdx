leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High stockouts and late deliveries to retailers due to weak account-level
      forecasts; typical fill-rate shortfall of 3–10% vs target, causing lost
      sales and chargebacks
    - >-
      Excess inventory and obsolete styles from overbuying at style/color/size
      level; 10–25% of on-hand becomes slow-moving within a season
    - >-
      Forecasts are not granular enough (SKU–color–size by account/region) and
      don’t reflect retailer calendars, promos, or order cutoffs
    - >-
      Limited use of sell-through (EDI 852) and inventory (EDI 846) data to
      adjust open-to-buy and reorder points in-season
    - >-
      Human planners spend 30–60% of time on spreadsheet data wrangling; low
      planner leverage reduces agility during demand shocks
    - >-
      Vendor constraints (MOQs, pack sizes, containers, lead-time variability)
      aren’t baked into buy plans, resulting in misaligned POs
    - >-
      New style launches lack attribute-based analogs/size curves, leading to
      poor initial buys and markdown risk
    - >-
      Disconnected systems (ERP, EDI, 3PL, WMS) delay visibility; decisions lag
      by 1–2 weeks
  solution:
    - >-
      Data foundation in 2–4 weeks: Connect to ERP, EDI (850/852/846/856),
      WMS/3PL; normalize SKUs, colors, sizes, and map retailers/regions
    - >-
      Account- and region-specific ML forecasts at SKU–color–size weekly
      buckets, integrating seasonality, sell-through, promo calendars, and price
      effects
    - >-
      New-style cold-start using attribute analogs (category, construction,
      material, brand line) and learned size curves; auto-adjusted by early POS
    - >-
      Buy plan generator: Converts demand to supply under constraints (vendor
      MOQ, pack size, master carton, ports, lead times, supplier calendars,
      currency)
    - >-
      Reorder policy engine: Service-level based reorder points and safety stock
      per SKU–account/region with variable lead times; exception-based alerts
    - >-
      PO proposals and containerization: Recommend order quantities by
      vendor/ship window; optimize to full containers where relevant
    - >-
      Scenario planning: What-if for promos, ship dates, lead time slips, price
      changes, and substitutions/cross-color cannibalization
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration: Push POs and reorder points to ERP; pull
      confirmations and receipts; measure forecast accuracy, bias, WOS, turns,
      and GMROI
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SoleCast delivers SKU–color–size forecasts by account/region and turns them
    into vendor-ready buy plans and reorder points, improving fill rate by 3–8%,
    cutting stockouts by 20–40%, and reducing excess inventory by 10–20% within
    60 days of go-live.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    models, retailer calendar mappings, and vendor pack/MOQ/container

  character: >-
    Footwear wholesale merchandisers, planners, and sales ops leaders (NAICS
    424340) who must buy the right style–color–size mix by account and region
    without tying up cash.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented demand by account/region, long lead times and MOQs,
    volatile reorders, spreadsheet chaos, chargebacks.

    Internal: Constant pressure to guess, fear of stockouts or overbuys, no time
    for strategic work.

    Philosophical: Data should make buying obvious—retailers and consumers
    deserve the right style–color–size available when promised.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know pre-books vs. at-once, size-curve risk, and the cost of
    missing seasonal windows.

    Authority: Category-trained AI for footwear; ingests EDI 852/POS, orders,
    and inventory; SKU–color–size forecasts by account/region; integrations
    (NetSuite, SAP, BlueCherry); security-first (SOC 2); proven accuracy lifts.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Connect data: POS/EDI 852, wholesale orders, inventory, catalogs,
    doors/regions.

    2) Configure: Service levels and constraints; SKU–color–size models by
    account/region.

    3) Operate: Weekly buy plans with PO proposals, reorder points, and
    exception alerts; review/approve in workflow.

    Assurances: Transparent logic and overrides, you own your data, low-risk 4–6
    week pilot.

    Direct: Schedule a demo; start a 60-day pilot with 1–2 categories.

    Transitional: Get a free Forecast Accuracy Audit and sample buy plan;
    download the ROI calculator and case study.
  success: >-
    - Higher fill rate and OTIF, fewer stockouts

    - 10–20% forecast-accuracy lift; 15–30% less inventory with faster turns

    - Improved GMROI and cash flow; fewer markdowns and chargebacks

    - Confident buys by account/region/size; planners focus on strategy, not
    spreadsheets

    - Stronger retailer trust and repeat orders
  failure: |-
    - Missed sell-in windows and lost shelf space
    - Stockouts followed by excess and markdowns
    - Cash trapped in the wrong sizes and colors
    - Chargebacks, warehouse overflow, and eroded margins
    - Burned-out teams forced to guess instead of plan
