    - Galleries
    - Conservators
  triggers:
    - Intake or pre-sale
    - Loan or shipping prep

    - Volume tiers for large inventories
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4
  risks:
    - Image quality variability limits detection
    - Model may mislabel damage types
    - Conservation advice must be non-diagnostic
  dependencies:
    - Good-quality photos
    - Dealer’s condition schema/templates
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Condition reports are often paper/PDF with free-text notes and hand-drawn
      sketches, making them non-searchable and hard to compare over time.
    - >-
      Manual transcription and image annotation take 30–90 minutes per work,
      creating backlogs before fairs, shipments, and consignments.
    - >-
      Inconsistent terminology and formats across staff and locations reduce
      quality and increase disputes with consignors/buyers and insurers.
    - >-
      Damage discovered after transit leads to finger-pointing; lack of
      timestamped, standardized, and image-linked documentation weakens claims.
    - >-
      Existing OCR tools misread conservation terminology and handwriting;
      generic AI vision misses fine-grained art-specific issues (craquelure,
      foxing, stretcher bar marks).
    - >-
      Dealers lack a unified repository to link structured condition data to
      inventory/CRM, leading to duplicate entry in Artlogic/ArtBinder/ArtBase
      and cloud drives.
    - >-
      Regulatory and client expectations around provenance, due diligence, and
      insurer requirements are rising, but auditing/version control for
      condition data is weak.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest pipeline for scans, photos, and PDFs via drag-and-drop, email-in,
      API, or watched folders (Dropbox/Drive).
    - >-
      Domain-tuned OCR/NLP that normalizes free text to a condition schema
      (e.g., Object ID fields + conservation terms) with synonym mapping and
      multilingual support (EN/FR/DE/IT/ES).
    - >-
      Computer vision to detect and segment common issues (abrasions, tears,
      craquelure density, foxing, stains, paint loss, frame damage, warping,
      stretcher bar marks) and auto-generate annotated overlays.
    - >-
      Before/after comparison to flag new or worsened damage between two image
      sets (pre- and post-shipment).
    - >-
      Reviewer workflow: human-in-the-loop validation of OCR fields and
      detections; acceptance history and change logs.
    - >-
      One-click exports (PDF with image overlays, JSON/CSV for systems,
      insurer-ready summary) and integrations (Artlogic, ArtBinder, ArtBase;
      Artsy inventory notes; logistics job IDs).
    - >-
      Security and compliance: per-report cryptographic timestamps and hashes of
      images/annotations; access control; audit trails; optional watermarking.
    - >-
      Dashboard and analytics: condition trends by artist, medium, shipper, or
      fair; SLA timers for inbound consignments.
    - >-
      Professional onboarding: migration of legacy reports; scanning guidelines
      and capture QA (blur, glare, color patch checks).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any condition report into trusted, structured data and an interactive,
    timestamped damage map in minutes—standardized, searchable, and integrated
    with your inventory systems to reduce disputes, speed transactions, and
    improve insurability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, fine art–specific annotated dataset and detectors validated
    with conservators, combined with deep integrations into leading gallery
    inventory systems and insurer-aligned report templates. This creates
    switching costs via embedded workflows, historical model tuning per client,
    and credibility in claims/dispute contexts that generic OCR/CV tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Art dealers, gallery registrars, and advisers (NAICS 459920) who need
    reliable, standardized condition reporting and damage mapping for inventory,
    viewings, loans, and shipments.
  problem: >-
    - External: Paper/scan reports are slow to produce, inconsistent across
    handlers, hard to search, and images lack clear annotations.

    - Internal: Teams feel exposed to disputes and insurer pushback, and
    overwhelmed by backlog and last-minute requests.

    - Philosophical: Artwork condition should be transparent, standardized, and
    portable for every stakeholder.
  guide: >-
    We understand the registrar crunch and fair-setup chaos. Our team blends
    conservation advisors with art-tech engineers. We turn paper/scan condition
    reports into structured data and annotated imagery with detected
    issues—auditable, consistent, and ready to share.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Upload scans, PDFs, or photos via web, bulk ingest, or API. 2)
    AI extracts fields and flags issues; you review and approve. 3) Export to
    CMS/ERP/insurer packets; share read-only links; maintain an audit trail.

    - Agreement: Privacy-first; encryption in transit/at rest;
    roles/permissions; on-shore storage options; human-in-the-loop review; no
    training on your assets unless you opt in.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 20-minute demo and start a pilot with your next 25 reports.

    - Transitional: Download the condition-reporting checklist and view sample
    annotated outputs.
  success: >-
    Standardized, searchable records; faster intake and checkout; clearer
    liability assignment; smoother insurer conversations; fewer disputes and
    delays; confident sales, loans, and consignments.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams stay in manual re-entry and scattered photos, miss or
    mislabel damage, face avoidable disputes and shipment delays, and erode
    trust with clients and insurers.
