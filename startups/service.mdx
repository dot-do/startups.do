leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High inbound call volume for service intake/status (often 40–60% of calls)
      ties up counter staff 3–6 minutes per call, causing missed calls and
      walk-in delays.
    - >-
      Incomplete work-order info (missing model/serial, symptoms, photos)
      creates 10–15 minutes of rework per job at check-in; duplicate DMS entry
      wastes admin time.
    - >-
      Unstructured estimates lead to wide variance in quote accuracy (±30%
      common), margin leakage, and customer mistrust.
    - >-
      Technician under-utilization due to gaps, no-shows (8–15%), and poor
      triage/parts readiness; after-hours demand is lost.
    - >-
      Seasonality (spring/summer spikes, winter lull) makes scheduling chaotic;
      backlogs create poor customer experience and OEM dealer score impacts.
    - >-
      Lack of integrations: service requests from web/SMS/phone aren’t synced to
      DMS; manual work-order creation and calendar updates cause errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel intake bot (web widget, SMS, phone IVR, QR in-store) to
      capture customer/equipment info, symptoms, photos/videos, preferred times.
    - >-
      AI triage maps symptoms to likely issues, parts, and flat-rate labor for
      fast, consistent preliminary estimates.
    - >-
      Real-time scheduling that places jobs by skill, duration, parts
      availability, and SLAs; automated waitlist and back-order rescheduling.
    - >-
      1-click work-order creation in the DMS with verified model/serial,
      customer, unit history, and intake notes; no duplicate data entry.
    - >-
      Automated reminders and confirmations (SMS/email), deposit options, and
      policy enforcement to reduce no-shows.
    - >-
      Customer self-service status updates and approvals; two-way messaging with
      audit trail synced to the DMS.
    - >-
      Analytics: conversion, utilization, estimate accuracy, no-show rates,
      CSAT; alerts to staffing and parts constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Book more repairs and fill your tech calendar automatically. AI intake
    triage collects complete job details, quotes standard services consistently,
    creates work orders in your DMS, and schedules the right technician. Cut
    phone time by 50%, reduce no-shows by 40%, and increase technician
    utilization by 10–20 points—ROI in the first 30 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned OPE triage and flat-rate library plus deep DMS integrations
    that eliminate duplicate entry. Data network effects from thousands of
    anonymized intakes improve estimate accuracy and scheduling automatically.
    First-mover partner agreements with key DMS/OEM programs create distribution
    and switching costs.
