  problem:
    - >-
      Yield variability across zones of the same field (often 20–40 bu/ac swing)
      is poorly predicted with generic tools, leading to over/under-application
      of seed, P, K, and fungicide.
    - >-
      Early disease pressure (SDS, white mold, frogeye leaf spot, brown stem
      rot, SCN) is detected too late; losses of 5–20 bu/ac are common in
      high-pressure years.
    - >-
      Herbicide resistance (waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, marestail) drives
      over-application and tank-mix costs; mis-IDs and timing errors reduce
      control and increase spend by $10–25/ac.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (equipment, imagery, scouting notes, soil tests, weather,
      grain settlement) makes in-season decisions slow; growers spend 3–5
      hours/week on data wrangling during peak season.
    - Inefficient variable-rate prescriptions: >-
        many growers either don’t use VR or use generic templates, leaving 5–10%
        seed and 10–20% input savings unrealized.
    - >-
      Labor constraints and limited agronomist bandwidth lead to missed scouting
      windows; drone/imagery data goes underutilized without automated insights.
    - >-
      Increasing demand for sustainability and carbon reporting creates
      administrative burden; growers lack easy MRV to access premiums or comply
      with programs.
    - >-
      Price volatility and basis risk are managed manually; few tools link
      agronomic outlook (yield probability) to marketing/hedging decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Soybean-specific ML models for yield probability, disease risk (SDS, white
      mold, frogeye), and weed species detection with zone-level prescriptions.
    - >-
      Automated variable-rate seeding and P/K/lime prescriptions using
      multi-year yield maps, soil grids, elevation, and imagery-derived vigor
      indices.

      disease pressure forecasts, canopy conditions, and economics.
