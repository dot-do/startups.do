leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - Yield variability across zones of the same field (often 20–40 bu/ac swing) is poorly predicted with generic tools, leading to over/under-application of seed, P, K, and fungicide.
    - Early disease pressure (SDS, white mold, frogeye leaf spot, brown stem rot, SCN) is detected too late; losses of 5–20 bu/ac are common in high-pressure years.
    - Herbicide resistance (waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, marestail) drives over-application and tank-mix costs; mis-IDs and timing errors reduce control and increase spend by $10–25/ac.
    - Fragmented data (equipment, imagery, scouting notes, soil tests, weather, grain settlement) makes in-season decisions slow; growers spend 3–5 hours/week on data wrangling during peak season.
    - Inefficient variable-rate prescriptions: many growers either don't use VR or use generic templates, leaving 5–10% seed and 10–20% input savings unrealized.
    - Labor constraints and limited agronomist bandwidth lead to missed scouting windows; drone/imagery data goes underutilized without automated insights.
    - Increasing demand for sustainability and carbon reporting creates administrative burden; growers lack easy MRV to access premiums or comply with programs.
    - Price volatility and basis risk are managed manually; few tools link agronomic outlook (yield probability) to marketing/hedging decisions.
  solution:
    - Soybean-specific ML models for yield probability, disease risk (SDS, white mold, frogeye), and weed species detection with zone-level prescriptions.
    - Automated variable-rate seeding and P/K/lime prescriptions using multi-year yield maps, soil grids, elevation, and imagery-derived vigor indices.
    - In-season fungicide timing and product-selection advisor, integrating disease pressure forecasts, canopy conditions, and economics.
    - Edge AI for sprayers and planters: on-device weed/disease detection to reduce over-application; supports ISOBUS/ADAPT and JD, CNH, AGCO ecosystems.
    - Drone/satellite scouting automation with prioritization maps and task lists; mobile app for quick ground-truthing and note capture.
    - Sustainability and carbon MRV: per-field kg CO2e/bu estimates, practice tracking, and program-ready reports.
    - Grain marketing assist: links field-level yield distributions to hedge suggestions and alerts (advisory only; integrate with partner platforms for execution).
    - Seamless integrations to John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView, Ag Leader SMS, soil labs, and weather APIs for frictionless onboarding.
  uniqueValueProp: AI-native soybean platform that turns raw field data into precise, in-season actions. Deliver 3–7 bu/ac yield uplift and 10–20% input savings with a season-long ROI guarantee (3x subscription or refund), integrated directly with existing equipment and workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: A soybean-specialized AI stack trained on multi-state, multi-year labeled datasets with on-machine inference and closed-loop validation from retailer-run trials; coupled with distribution MOUs with key co-ops, and a season-long ROI guarantee that incumbents do not match.
