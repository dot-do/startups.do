  vision: "Precision soybean farming powered by AI insights."
  mission: "Transform raw field data into precise, profitable actions for soybean growers."
  purpose: "Maximize yield and minimize waste through intelligent agriculture."
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Yield variability across zones of the same field (often 20–40 bu/ac swing) is poorly predicted with generic tools, leading to over/under-application of seed, P, K, and fungicide."
    - "Early disease pressure (SDS, white mold, frogeye leaf spot, brown stem rot, SCN) is detected too late; losses of 5–20 bu/ac are common in high-pressure years."
    - "Herbicide resistance (waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, marestail) drives over-application and tank-mix costs; mis-IDs and timing errors reduce control and increase spend by $10–25/ac."
    - "Fragmented data (equipment, imagery, scouting notes, soil tests, weather, grain settlement) makes in-season decisions slow; growers spend 3–5 hours/week on data wrangling during peak season."
    - "Inefficient variable-rate prescriptions: many growers either don't use VR or use generic templates, leaving 5–10% seed and 10–20% input savings unrealized."
    - "Labor constraints and limited agronomist bandwidth lead to missed scouting windows; drone/imagery data goes underutilized without automated insights."
    - "Increasing demand for sustainability and carbon reporting creates administrative burden; growers lack easy MRV to access premiums or comply with programs."
    - "Price volatility and basis risk are managed manually; few tools link agronomic outlook (yield probability) to marketing/hedging decisions."
  solution:
    - "Soybean-specific ML models for yield probability, disease risk (SDS, white mold, frogeye), and weed species detection with zone-level prescriptions."
    - "Automated variable-rate seeding and P/K/lime prescriptions using multi-year yield maps, soil grids, elevation, and imagery-derived vigor indices."
    - "In-season fungicide timing and product-selection advisor, integrating disease pressure forecasts, canopy conditions, and economics."
    - "Edge AI for sprayers and planters: on-device weed/disease detection to reduce over-application; supports ISOBUS/ADAPT and JD, CNH, AGCO ecosystems."
    - "Drone/satellite scouting automation with prioritization maps and task lists; mobile app for quick ground-truthing and note capture."
    - "Sustainability and carbon MRV: per-field kg CO2e/bu estimates, practice tracking, and program-ready reports."
    - "Grain marketing assist: links field-level yield distributions to hedge suggestions and alerts (advisory only; integrate with partner platforms for execution)."
    - "Seamless integrations to John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView, Ag Leader SMS, soil labs, and weather APIs for frictionless onboarding."
  uniqueValueProp: "AI-native soybean platform that turns raw field data into precise, in-season actions. Deliver 3–7 bu/ac yield uplift and 10–20% input savings with a season-long ROI guarantee (3x subscription or refund), integrated directly with existing equipment and workflows."
  unfairAdvantage: "A soybean-specialized AI stack trained on multi-state, multi-year labeled datasets with on-machine inference and closed-loop validation from retailer-run trials; coupled with distribution MOUs with key co-ops, and a season-long ROI guarantee that incumbents do not match."
  customerSegments:
    - "Primary: US soybean growers managing 1,000–25,000+ acres, especially in IA, IL, MN, IN, NE, SD, ND, OH, MO."
    - "Agronomy retailers and co-ops (e.g., Nutrien, CHS, Growmark) seeking differentiated digital services and stickier customer relationships."
    - "Independent crop consultants/CCAs who want scalable, AI-driven scouting and prescription tools."
    - "OEMs and precision ag providers (John Deere, CNH, AGCO; Trimble; Raven) needing on-device AI advisories and prescription generation."
    - "Seed and chemical companies seeking plot analytics and product placement optimization in soybean-dominant geographies."
    - "Carbon/sustainability program operators (Truterra, Indigo, Nori) needing low-cost MRV for row crops."
  channels:
    - "Direct sales to large growers (≥5,000 acres) with enterprise pricing and dedicated agronomy support."
    - "Retailers/co-ops as value-added service: white-label or co-branded with training for agronomists; revenue share per acre."
    - "OEM integrations and app marketplaces (JD Operations Center, CNH, AGCO) to access existing equipment user bases."
    - "Independent CCA network referrals with per-acre commissions and enablement kits (demo fields, trial playbooks)."
    - "State soybean associations, extension field days, winter agronomy meetings, and plot trials to build trust and local proof."
    - "Digital demand gen: webinars, yield contest case studies, ROI calculators, and in-season alert teasers; retarget via ag media outlets."
    - "Pilot programs with seed/chem reps bundling trials on side-by-side plots; discount for first 2,000 acres per grower."
