  problem:
    - Yield variability across zones of the same field (often 20–40 bu/ac swing) is poorly predicted with generic tools, leading to over/under-application of seed, P, K, and fungicide.
    - Early disease pressure (SDS, white mold, frogeye leaf spot, brown stem rot, SCN) is detected too late; losses of 5–20 bu/ac are common in high-pressure years.
    - Herbicide resistance (waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, marestail) drives over-application and tank-mix costs; mis-IDs and timing errors reduce control and increase spend by $10–25/ac.
    - Fragmented data (equipment, imagery, scouting notes, soil tests, weather, grain settlement) makes in-season decisions slow; growers spend 3–5 hours/week on data wrangling during peak season.
    - Inefficient variable-rate prescriptions: many growers either don't use VR or use generic templates, leaving 5–10% seed and 10–20% input savings unrealized.
    - Labor constraints and limited agronomist bandwidth lead to missed scouting windows; drone/imagery data goes underutilized without automated insights.
    - Increasing demand for sustainability and carbon reporting creates administrative burden; growers lack easy MRV to access premiums or comply with programs.
    - Price volatility and basis risk are managed manually; few tools link agronomic outlook (yield probability) to marketing/hedging decisions.
  solution:
    - Soybean-specific ML models for yield probability, disease risk (SDS, white mold, frogeye), and weed species detection with zone-level prescriptions.
    - Automated variable-rate seeding and P/K/lime prescriptions using multi-year yield maps, soil grids, elevation, and imagery-derived vigor indices.
    - In-season fungicide timing and product-selection advisor, integrating disease pressure forecasts, canopy conditions, and economics.
    - Edge AI for sprayers and planters: on-device weed/disease detection to reduce over-application; supports ISOBUS/ADAPT and JD, CNH, AGCO ecosystems.
    - Drone/satellite scouting automation with prioritization maps and task lists; mobile app for quick ground-truthing and note capture.
    - Sustainability and carbon MRV: per-field kg CO2e/bu estimates, practice tracking, and program-ready reports.
    - Grain marketing assist: links field-level yield distributions to hedge suggestions and alerts (advisory only; integrate with partner platforms for execution).
    - Seamless integrations to John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView, Ag Leader SMS, soil labs, and weather APIs for frictionless onboarding.
  uniqueValueProp: AI-native soybean platform that turns raw field data into precise, in-season actions. Deliver 3–7 bu/ac yield uplift and 10–20% input savings with a season-long ROI guarantee (3x subscription or refund), integrated directly with existing equipment and workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: A soybean-specialized AI stack trained on multi-state, multi-year labeled datasets with on-machine inference and closed-loop validation from retailer-run trials; coupled with distribution MOUs with key co-ops, and a season-long ROI guarantee that incumbents do not match.
  customerSegments:
    - Primary: US soybean growers managing 1,000–25,000+ acres, especially in IA, IL, MN, IN, NE, SD, ND, OH, MO.
    - Agronomy retailers and co-ops (e.g., Nutrien, CHS, Growmark) seeking differentiated digital services and stickier customer relationships.
    - Independent crop consultants/CCAs who want scalable, AI-driven scouting and prescription tools.
    - OEMs and precision ag providers (John Deere, CNH, AGCO; Trimble; Raven) needing on-device AI advisories and prescription generation.
    - Seed and chemical companies seeking plot analytics and product placement optimization in soybean-dominant geographies.
    - Carbon/sustainability program operators (Truterra, Indigo, Nori) needing low-cost MRV for row crops.
  channels:
    - Direct sales to large growers (≥5,000 acres) with enterprise pricing and dedicated agronomy support.
    - Retailers/co-ops as value-added service: white-label or co-branded with training for agronomists; revenue share per acre.
    - OEM integrations and app marketplaces (JD Operations Center, CNH, AGCO) to access existing equipment user bases.
    - Independent CCA network referrals with per-acre commissions and enablement kits (demo fields, trial playbooks).
    - State soybean associations, extension field days, winter agronomy meetings, and plot trials to build trust and local proof.
    - Digital demand gen: webinars, yield contest case studies, ROI calculators, and in-season alert teasers; retarget via ag media outlets.
    - Pilot programs with seed/chem reps bundling trials on side-by-side plots; discount for first 2,000 acres per grower.
    - Geospatial partners (Planet, Sentinel resellers, drone service providers) co-selling imagery + insights bundles.
  revenueStreams:
    - Per-acre subscription: Standard $3/ac/year (imagery + analytics + basic prescriptions); Pro $6/ac/year (disease advisor, VR seeding, edge AI support).
    - Add-ons: In-season drone AI scouting $2/ac/pass; fungicide timing module $1/ac; carbon MRV $1/ac; harvest optimization $0.50/ac.
    - Per-operation detection fee for edge-enabled sprayers: $0.20/ac per pass; volume discounts for >100k pass acres.
    - Enterprise/retailer licensing: $50k–$500k/year depending on acreage tiers, users, and white-label requirements.
    - Success fee: 10% of verified input savings above baseline for VR prescriptions and precision spraying.
    - Data products (aggregated, anonymized): plot analytics and benchmarking for seed/chem R&D; $100k–$1M/yr contracts (with strict privacy controls).
    - Professional services: on-farm onboarding, custom model tuning, and API integrations; $150–$250/hr or per-project SOW.
    - Hardware margin (optional) on edge kits or camera retrofits when bundled with Pro (target 20–30% gross margin).
  costStructure:
    - COGS per managed acre: cloud compute and storage $0.15–$0.30; imagery/licensing $0.15–$0.50; model inference $0.05–$0.15; support $0.10–$0.20.
    - R&D: ML engineers, agronomists, data engineers; $3–5M/year in first 2 years for model development and field validation.
    - Sales and marketing: field reps, demo plots, travel, events, channel commissions (10–20% of ACV).
    - Field trials and data labeling: $500–$1,000 per trial location per season; multi-state protocol budget $500k–$1M/year.
    - Partnership and integration costs: OEM certification fees, marketplace rev share (5–15%), integration engineering.
    - General and administrative: compliance, data privacy, legal for data-sharing agreements; E&O insurance for agronomic recommendations.
    - Edge hardware program (optional): camera kits and compute modules for pilot fleets; $1,000–$2,500 per machine (capex or pass-through).
  keyMetrics:
