leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual scheduling takes 10–20 hours per project and 3–6 additional hours
      per major change; resequencing is error-prone under time pressure.
    - >-
      Complex constraints (cast/location availability, day/night, stunts/VFX,
      turnaround/meal rules, travel times) are hard to encode and check; union
      compliance violations trigger costly penalties.
    - >-
      Daily call sheets require redundant data entry across tools; prep takes
      60–120 minutes/day and distribution/confirmation tracking is fragmented.
    - >-
      Last-minute changes aren’t propagated to calendars fast enough;
      miscommunications cause late arrivals and idle crew time.
    - >-
      Limited ability to run ‘what-if’ scenarios; producers can’t quickly
      quantify cost/time impact of changes (e.g., company moves, weather
      shifts).
    - >-
      Data lives in silos (script tools, spreadsheets, email). Imports/exports
      break and version control is weak, creating risk on set.
    - >-
      Existing tools focus on formatting call sheets, not optimizing schedules
      against real-world constraints and cost drivers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest script breakdowns (FDX/PDF/CSV) and constraints (cast/location
      availability, union rules, travel times, day/night windows) to generate an
      optimized multi-day shooting schedule.
    - >-
      Auto-build daily call sheets from the schedule with live data (weather,
      sunrise/sunset, maps, contacts, attachments), and distribute via email/SMS
      with read receipts and confirmations.
    - >-
      One-click calendar sync (Google/Outlook/iCal) for cast and crew; automatic
      updates on time changes, location moves, and cancellations.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: run multiple schedule candidates (e.g., minimize
      company moves vs. minimize cast idle vs. minimize overtime), compare
      cost/time/risk scores, and apply with version control.
    - >-
      Compliance engine: flags turnaround/meal break risks by union/guild,
      calculates potential penalties, and recommends schedule adjustments.
    - >-
      Change management: track deltas across versions, generate change summaries
      for departments, and log approvals for auditability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn your breakdown and constraints into an optimized shooting schedule in
    hours (not days), auto-build compliant call sheets, and sync changes
    instantly to every calendar—cutting scheduling time by 70%, reducing
    overtime/meal penalties by 10–20%, and improving on-time crew confirmations
    to 90%+ within 2 hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A production-grade constraint engine trained on real schedules/call sheets
    and regional union rules, plus a closed-loop data advantage: every
    distributed call sheet and schedule change returns confirmations and
    outcomes that continuously improve optimization heuristics. Combined with
    deep calendar/comms integration and compliance checks, we deliver measurable
    cost/time reductions competitors can’t match with template-centric tools.

  character: >-
    Producers, 1st/2nd ADs, and production managers who want a conflict‑free
    schedule and accurate daily call sheets—built in minutes and synced to every
    calendar.
  problem: >-
    External: Shifting cast/location availability, daylight and turnaround
    limits, and budget constraints make schedules fragile and call sheets
    error‑prone.

    Internal: Late nights in spreadsheets create stress and fear of missing
    conflicts that damage trust.

    Philosophical: Crews deserve clarity and time for craft—not manual admin.
  guide: >-
    We understand last‑minute script changes, holds, and resets. Built with
    input from working ADs and PMs, our AI respects real‑world constraints
    (availability, turnaround, locations) and outputs clean, production‑ready
    schedules and call sheets.
  plan: >-
    1) Import breakdown and constraints (scenes, cast/location availability,
    rules).

    2) Auto‑optimize schedule; review scenarios; lock the plan.

    3) Auto‑build daily call sheets; sync to Google/Outlook; push updates with
    change logs.

    Agreement: Human‑in‑the‑loop approvals, clear data ownership, and
    auditability.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on your current show or book a 20‑minute demo.

    Transitional: Download a sample schedule/call sheet and run a sandbox with
    dummy data.
  success: >-
    Prep days saved, cleaner turnarounds, fewer conflicts and OT, call sheets
    sent on time, one source of truth across calendars, calmer crews, and
    on‑schedule wraps.
  failure: >-
    Missed conflicts, blown budgets, overtime, late or inaccurate call sheets,
    confused crews, and schedule chaos that erodes trust.
