  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers struggle to consistently hit AAFCO/FEDIAF nutrient
      minimums/maximums across ingredient variability (COAs) and process losses,
      causing compliance drift and costly rework.
    - >-
      Ingredient price volatility and supply constraints make least-cost,
      compliant reformulation frequent; spreadsheets and legacy tools are slow
      and error-prone, delaying launch windows and purchase decisions.
    - >-
      Disconnected procurement–R&D–QA workflows lead to late COA surprises,
      off-spec batches, and emergency ingredient swaps that risk recalls and
      label non-compliance.
    - >-
      Current optimization rarely accounts for statistical variability
      (lot-to-lot, supplier-to-supplier) or process-induced nutrient
      degradation, resulting in over-fortification and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Multi-plant, multi-line operations lack a single source of truth for
      formulations, constraints, process parameters, and audit trails,
      increasing regulatory exposure and auditing costs.
    - >-
      Scenario planning (e.g., supply shock, price spike, nutrient max change)
      is manual, making it hard to quantify risk and cost-to-serve across SKUs
      and plants.
    - >-
      Emerging claims (grain-free, limited ingredient, novel proteins,
      sustainability) add complex constraints that are difficult to encode and
      maintain in standard formulation tools.
  solution:
    - >-
      Robust least-cost formulation engine that optimizes to AAFCO/FEDIAF and
      label claims while accounting for COA variability, nutrient degradation,
      and plant/process constraints.
    - >-
      Digital twin for key processes (extrusion, retort, dryer) to model
      moisture/fat uptake, thermal losses (e.g., thiamine, taurine), density,
      and throughput constraints during optimization.
    - >-
      Automated ingestion and normalization of COAs and price updates from
      suppliers/LIMS; Monte Carlo and chance-constrained optimization to ensure
      compliance with 95–99.5% confidence.
    - >-
      Multi-plant, multi-line SKU management with role-based access, version
      control, and end-to-end audit trails for regulatory inspections.
    - >-
      Scenario planner to evaluate ingredient substitutions, supplier changes,
      price spikes, and spec updates; quantifies risk-adjusted cost and service
      impact.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to ERP/MES/PLM/LIMS (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Aptean,
      Deacom, Sage X3, LabVantage) to sync BOMs, specs, COAs, and batch
      instructions.
    - >-
      Label and claim checkers (AAFCO/FEDIAF, nutrient maxima, Ca:P ratios,
      copper/selenium limits, cat-essential AA, grain-free, novel proteins,
      allergen exclusions).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce cost per ton by 1.5–4% while increasing lot-level AAFCO/FEDIAF
    compliance to 99%+ via robust, variability-aware optimization that
    integrates real-time COAs, ingredient prices, and plant process
    constraints—delivered as a secure, auditable, and fast-to-integrate AI
    platform.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Formulation managers, nutritionists, QA/RA, and operations leaders at dog
    and cat food manufacturers who want every recipe to meet AAFCO/FEDIAF
    targets at the lowest reliable cost—without constant firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile ingredient prices, COA variability, supplier
    substitutions, and process limits (e.g., moisture, density, extrusion,
    palatant caps) make cost control and nutrient compliance hard; spreadsheets
    force over-formulation.

    Internal: Teams are frustrated by late changes, guesswork, and compliance
    anxiety.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between compliant nutrition and
    healthy margins.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of hitting AAFCO/FEDIAF every batch while
    protecting margin and throughput. Our AI optimizer—built with pet
    nutritionists and optimization engineers—models COA/price distributions,
    honors process constraints, explains trade-offs, and outputs
    production-ready formulas with full auditability.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Connect data: ingredient specs/prices/COAs and process constraints; set
    AAFCO/FEDIAF targets.

    2) Optimize & simulate: cost-minimizing formulations under COA/price
    variability; sensitivities and scenarios.

    3) Approve & deploy: human-in-the-loop review; push to ERP/MES/LIMS; monitor
    drift and auto re-optimize.

    Agreement:

    - Start in a sandbox on a few SKUs.

    - Transparent constraints; you can override any rule.

    - Exportable audit trail and validation checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot on 1–3 SKUs.

    Transitional: Get a free COA variability risk audit and sample optimization
    report.
  success: >-
    Consistent AAFCO/FEDIAF compliance at minimum cost; reduced
    over-formulation; stronger margins; faster approvals; fewer holds/reworks;
    resilient supply plans; clear documentation and traceability; a calm,
    confident team.
  failure: >-
    Missed nutrient targets, costly overages, last-minute reformulation fire
    drills when COAs shift, line slowdowns and rework/holds, margin erosion, and
    avoidable compliance and brand risk.
