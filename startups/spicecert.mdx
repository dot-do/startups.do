  problem:
    - >-
      Manual CoA/spec/allergen document creation consumes 5–15 minutes per lot;
      mid-size plants issue 500–2,000 CoAs/month, tying up 0.5–2 FTEs in data
      entry and checks.
    - >-
      Supplier CoAs/specs arrive in inconsistent formats (PDF scans, emails,
      portals), causing transcription errors (1–3% error rate) and shipment
      holds.
    - >-
      Blend-level CoAs require roll-up math from multiple lots and analytes
      (e.g., moisture, volatile oil, ASTA color, capsaicinoids, piperine) and
      often result in miscalculations and customer disputes.
    - >-
      Spec validation is fragmented across LIMS, ERP, and spreadsheets, leading
      to out-of-spec shipments or delayed releases when QA can’t reconcile
      results quickly.
    - >-
      Allergen statements and cross-contact declarations are versioned manually;
      outdated templates increase audit risk and rework during customer
      approvals.
    - >-
      Audit readiness for GFSI (SQF/BRCGS) and FSMA requires traceable approval
      workflows and change logs; generating evidence packages takes days during
      audits/recalls.
    - >-
      Third-party lab results (e.g., microbiology, pesticides, heavy metals,
      mycotoxins) arrive via email; lack of integration delays lot disposition
      by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Customer-specific CoA formats and portals (PDF, CSV, XML uploads) add
      repetitive formatting tasks and increase error rates.
    - >-
      Chargebacks and credits arise from documentation errors (e.g., missing
      test lines, wrong units, incorrect lot-linking), costing $10k–$100k
      annually for mid-size producers.
    - >-
      Talent shortage in QA/Regulatory means onboarding new staff to complex doc
      processes takes 2–3 months; tribal knowledge risk is high.
    - >-
      Importers under FSVP need consistent supplier verification and spec
      conformance evidence; manual compilation is slow and incomplete.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion of lab data (LIMS/API, CSV) and supplier documents
      (email, portal, EDI) with high-accuracy OCR/NER tuned for spice analytes
      and units.
    - >-
      Rules-based and ML-assisted spec validation engine comparing results to
      product- and customer-specific specs, with blend roll-ups and uncertainty
      margins.
    - >-
      Template library for CoAs/specs/allergen statements mapped to common buyer
      formats; automatic population and e-signature with audit trails.
    - >-
      Exception management: out-of-spec flags, auto-requests for retest or
      deviation approval, and configurable release holds.
    - >-
      Customer delivery: auto-email, portal upload, EDI/API export; supports
      common customer portals and ASN attachments.
    - >-
      GFSI/FSMA/FSVP audit pack generation: evidencing spec revisions,
      approvals, change logs, and lot-level traceability in one click.
    - >-
      Version-controlled master data for specs, analytes, methods, limits,
      units, and sampling plans; role-based access and training records.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML, encryption, granular
      audit logs; data residency options.
    - >-
      Implementation accelerators: prebuilt connectors for common ERPs (Deacom,
      Aptean, Infor, SAP, Dynamics), LIMS (LabWare, QBench), and labs (Eurofins,
      Mérieux) where available.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn lab data and supplier documents into audit-ready CoAs, spec sheets, and
    allergen statements in minutes—validated against your specifications,
    auto-formatted for each customer, and fully traceable. Purpose-built for
    spice and extract manufacturing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained extraction and validation engine built on a proprietary
    corpus of spice/extract documents, combined with pre-validated parameter
    libraries (ASTA/AOAC aligned), buyer-specific templates, and lab/LIMS
    connectors. This allows high straight-through processing rates and short
    time-to-value unmatched by horizontal QMS/LIMS competitors.
