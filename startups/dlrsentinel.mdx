leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Static ratings force conservative limits that underutilize transmission
      capacity by 5–20% in many hours, driving congestion costs and renewable
      curtailment.
    - >-
      Operators lack a trusted, real-time estimate of safe dynamic ampacity with
      confidence bounds, creating fear of thermal/sag violations and limiting
      adoption.
    - >-
      Sensor-based DLR requires capex, outages/line work, and maintenance;
      coverage is often sparse, making system-wide scaling slow and expensive.
    - >-
      Alerts about rating deviations are either absent or noisy and are not
      integrated into EMS/SCADA workflows, leading to low operator trust and
      actionability.
    - >-
      Utilities need auditable models, data lineage, and change-management
      workflows to meet regulatory expectations; many AI tools are black-box and
      not compliance-ready.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time and forecast DLR computation using IEEE 738 heat balance with
      conductor parameters and microclimate-adjusted weather; physics + ML
      residual model to correct for terrain and local effects.
    - >-
      Uncertainty quantification (P50/P90/P95) and recommended operational
      rating bands to meet risk tolerances; safe fallbacks to static ratings.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts: upward headroom (DLR >> static) to increase transfers
      and downward derate risk (DLR < static) with configurable thresholds,
      lookahead, and confidence.
    - >-
      Turnkey integrations via ICCP/TASE.2, IEC 61850, CIM profiles, and OSIsoft
      PI; operator HMI tiles and web map with corridor views and event
      timelines.
    - >-
      Sensor-fusion: ingest LineVision/Ampacimon/Heimdall and utility sensors
      (sag, temp, vibration) to calibrate and validate; automatic model
      recalibration over time.
    - >-
      Audit-ready governance: versioned models, data lineage, backtesting, and
      reporting for internal review and regulatory filings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Operator-grade, software-first DLR estimation and alerting that safely
    unlocks 5–20% transfer capacity during favorable conditions, reduces
    congestion and curtailment, and integrates directly with EMS/SCADA—without
    mandatory new hardware—backed by quantified uncertainty and audit-ready
    reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Validated physics-ML DLR with probabilistic safety guarantees and automated
    microclimate calibration that works without dedicated sensors, coupled with
    plug-and-play EMS connectors and audit-ready governance. Defensible via
    unique datasets, field validations across climates, and integration
    footprint that shortens time-to-value vs. hardware-first or bespoke internal
    efforts.
