  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of bearings, gearboxes, and hydraulic systems in
      presses/mills/draw benches cause 8–20 hours of lost production per
      incident, plus high scrap and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Generic PdM tools miss nonferrous-specific patterns (high loads, low-speed
      rolling stands, complex gear-train sidebands, hydraulic pressure ripple)
      leading to poor signal-to-noise and alarm fatigue.
    - >-
      Reliability teams are understaffed; manual route-based vibration and oil
      analysis are infrequent and siloed from CMMS, delaying corrective actions.
    - >-
      CMMS backlogs grow because condition data doesn’t auto-translate into
      actionable work orders with clear cause codes and parts lists.
    - >-
      OEM monitoring is expensive, asset-specific, and not standardized across
      mixed-fleet plants; cross-asset visibility and benchmarking are limited.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud time-series analytics for vibration, load/torque, speed,
      hydraulic pressure/ripple, temperature, acoustics; fuses PLC/SCADA and
      IIoT data.
    - >-
      Asset-specific models for presses/mills/draw benches using frequency-order
      tracking and gear sideband detection; hydraulic models detect cavitation,
      aeration, stick-slip.
    - >-
      Auto-generated CMMS work orders with failure mode, severity, recommended
      tasks, estimated labor, and parts/spares list; bi-directional sync with
      SAP PM, IBM Maximo, eMaint, Fiix.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly alerts with explainable diagnostics (fault frequency
      matches, kurtosis/EN trend, pressure ripple harmonics) and remaining
      useful life estimate.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment: use existing sensors where available; partner kits for
      missing points (tri-axial accelerometers, pressure transducers).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Industry-specific predictive maintenance that flags
    bearing/gearbox/hydraulic issues early and automatically creates
    right-first-time CMMS work orders—cutting unplanned downtime 25–40% and
    increasing OEE 2–5% within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated library of nonferrous-specific failure modes and templates for
    presses/mills/draw benches, trained on low-speed/high-load data with
    explainable diagnostics, plus native CMMS work-order autogeneration using
    standardized cause codes—reducing time from anomaly to scheduled repair by
    50% compared to generic PdM tools.
