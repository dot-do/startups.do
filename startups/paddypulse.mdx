  title: AWD Irrigation & Water-Saving Schedule for Rice
  description: >-
    Automated Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) irrigation plan with weekly
    updates, using local weather and crop stage to minimize water use without
    yield loss.
  targetUsers:
    - Smallholder and commercial rice farmers
    - Irrigation scheme managers
    - Agri-NGOs/co-ops
  triggers:
    - Field registration/start of season

  steps:
    - 'Fetch 7–10 day weather (rain, temp, wind, RH) for the field'
    - Compute daily ET0 (FAO-56) and crop coefficient by growth stage
    - Run field water balance to estimate depletion and next irrigation date
    - 'Apply AWD rules (e.g., re-flood when water table 15 cm below surface)'
    - Generate weekly schedule and day-by-day guidance (on/off hours)
    - Send advisory via WhatsApp/SMS with water-saving estimate

  problem:
    - >-
      Rice farming is highly water-intensive; typical irrigated fields use
      7,000–12,000 m3/ha/season. Farmers lack precise, local schedules to cut
      water without risking yield.
    - >-
      Current AWD adoption is low because guidelines are generic and
      labor-intensive, requiring judgment on timing of drying/reflooding and
      monitoring field water levels.
    - >-
      Weather variability (monsoons, heat waves, canal rotations) makes fixed
      irrigation calendars unreliable, leading to over-irrigation and pumping
      cost waste.
    - >-
      Irrigation decisions are fragmented across water user groups; poor
      coordination causes conflicts, peak-demand shortages, and field-level
      stress.
    - >-
      Farmers fear yield loss; there is limited, trusted, field-specific
      decision support and feedback to ensure safe drying thresholds by crop
      stage.
    - >-
      Sustainability and buyer compliance (water footprint, methane reduction)
      require traceable evidence, which most farmers cannot generate.
    - >-
      Connectivity and smartphone limitations prevent many smallholders from
      using complex apps; advice must work via SMS/voice and local languages.
  solution:
    - >-
      Onboard fields via map or SMS; capture variety, sowing/transplant date,
      irrigation source, and water-turn constraints.
    - >-
      Generate weekly AWD irrigation plans that specify exact dry-down targets
      (e.g., water table 15 cm below surface) and reflood timing by growth
      stage.
    - >-
      Ingest local weather forecasts, remote sensing moisture indicators, and
      canal schedules to adjust plans and send alerts for heat waves or heavy
      rain.
    - >-
      Provide simple instructions via WhatsApp, SMS, or voice: when to irrigate,
      approximate hours to pump, and safe thresholds; offline caching for low
      connectivity.
    - >-
      Log irrigations (manual, SMS reply, or optional pump sensor) to adapt
      schedules and track adherence.
    - >-
      Offer risk safeguards: automatic “yield-protect” overrides during
      sensitive stages, salinity/soil constraints, and rain-triggered
      postponements.
    - >-
      Deliver sustainability and carbon-ready reports: water saved (m3/ha),
      energy/pumping cost saved, and estimated CH4 reduction (tCO2e/ha).
    - >-
      Extension/enterprise dashboards for aggregators, mills, and irrigation
      managers to coordinate rotations and benchmark performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Save 20–35% irrigation water without yield loss via an AI-powered, weekly
    AWD schedule tailored to each field’s weather, crop stage, and water
    delivery constraints—with simple, multilingual instructions over
    WhatsApp/SMS/IVR and traceable reports for buyers and carbon credits.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rice-specific AWD AI with field-validated thresholds and a closed-loop
    learning system, delivered through low-bandwidth channels and backed by

storyBrand:
  character: Rice farmers who want to cut water use and costs without sacrificing yield.
  problem: >-
    Irrigation timing is guesswork: changing weather, water limits, and labor
    shortages make AWD hard to run—causing overwatering, wasted pumping, and
    yield risk.
  guide: >-
    AWD Irrigation & Water-Saving Schedule for Rice is an AI guide that turns
    local weather and crop stage into a weekly, research-backed AWD plan—so you
    know exactly when to flood, drain, and reflood.
  plan: >-
    Steps: 1) Add fields (location, variety, planting date); 2) Set target water
    depths or connect sensors; 3) Get weekly AWD schedules and alerts; 4)
    Irrigate only when prompted; 5) Review results and adjust through the
    season.
  callToAction: >-
    Request a demo and set up your first field to receive next week’s AWD
    schedule.
  success: >-
    Confident, low-stress irrigation: less water and energy use, stable yields,
    fewer field visits, and clear records that meet water-use goals.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing and risk overwatering, higher pumping costs, missed AWD
    windows, regulatory pressure, and avoidable yield stress.
