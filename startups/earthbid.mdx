  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9.5
    modelCapability: 7.5
    overall: 8.5
  risks:
    - Scale or datum errors in PDFs

    - Access to bid form and unit cost templates
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 6–20 hours per bid manually measuring PDFs for clearing,
      stripping, excavation, erosion control, and utilities, causing missed
      deadlines and higher labor costs.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size site-prep contractors lack specialized earthwork
      software expertise; training new estimators takes months and slows
      bidding.
    - >-
      Errors and omissions (1–3% on earthwork quantities) can swing margins by
      $10k–$250k per project; there’s no fast, auditable way to validate
      quantities.
    - >-
      Plan revisions trigger rework and version-control issues; recalculating
      deltas between Issued for Bid and Addenda is tedious and error-prone.
    - >-
      Existing tools (Bluebeam, PlanSwift, AGTEK, InSite, TBC) are powerful but
      time-intensive; moving data into HCSS/Excel/AGTEK requires manual mapping.
    - >-
      Determining import/export requires shrink/swell assumptions and typical
      section depths that are often inconsistently applied or undocumented.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload multi-sheet PDF bid set; auto-detect scales, sheets, and relevant
      plan types (grading, erosion control, utilities).
    - >-
      Set project assumptions (topsoil strip depth, typical section,
      shrink/swell factors by soil type), or select from templates by
      region/agency.
    - >-
      AI extracts limits of disturbance, tree save areas, subgrade regions,
      contours, utility alignments/sizes, structures, and erosion controls;
      computes areas, lengths, counts, and volumes.
    - >-
      Automatic import/export calculation with adjustable shrink/swell and
      over-excavation rules; scenario compare on assumptions.
    - >-
      QC mode with color-coded overlays, confidence scores, and discrepancy
      flags; optional human-in-the-loop verification within 2–8 business hours.
    - >-
      Revision diff: upload Addendum sheets and receive delta quantities and a
      change log in minutes.
    - >-
      Export to CSV/Excel, HCSS cost codes, and AGTEK/Trimble-friendly formats;
      generate a bid-ready quantity workbook with assumptions log and traceable
      markup snapshots.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, auditable site-prep takeoffs from PDF plans in minutes. Get
    clearing/stripping areas, cut/fill with shrink/swell, erosion control, and
    utility trench quantities with human-verified accuracy, one-click exports to
    Excel/HCSS/AGTEK, and instant revision diffs—cut bid prep time by 80%+ and
    reduce quantity risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and templates purpose-built for site-prep (not
    generic 2D takeoff), enriched by a proprietary civil-plan dataset and a
    human-in-the-loop QA layer that produces auditable, estimator-grade outputs
    and revision diffs. Tight exports to HCSS/AGTEK and a growing assumptions
    library reduce risk and switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Site preparation estimators and contractors who want fast, accurate,
    defensible quantities from bid plan PDFs to win profitable work.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual takeoffs from PDFs are slow, tedious, and error-prone
    across clearing, stripping, excavation, import/export, erosion control, and
    basic utilities.

    - Internal: Deadline pressure creates stress and doubt about missed scope
    and blown margins.

    - Philosophical: Estimators should spend time pricing and strategy, not
    tracing lines for hours.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the bid-crunch, addenda churn, and the risk of
    hidden scope in site prep.

    - Authority: Built with civil estimator input; uses computer vision to
    extract areas/lengths/elevations; produces auditable quantities, markups,
    and stated assumptions.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload plan PDFs and select scope (clearing, stripping, excavation,
    import/export, erosion control, basic utilities).

    2) AI detects areas, lengths, depths, and contours; calculates quantities
    with transparent assumptions.

    3) Review and adjust; export Excel/CSV and marked-up plan sheets.

    Assurances: per-project pricing, no long-term contract, private and secure,
    clear audit trail.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Upload a plan set to get quantities in minutes.
    - Transitional: Book a 15-minute demo or download a sample takeoff report.
  success: |-
    - Bid faster with consistent, defensible quantities.
    - Improve accuracy on earthwork and import/export balancing.
    - Standardize takeoffs across the team with clear assumptions and markups.
    - Win more work at target margins and respond to addenda quickly.
  failure: |-
    - Keep burning nights tracing PDFs and double-checking math.
    - Submit late or padded bids; lose work or profit.
    - Miss erosion control or utility items; face change-order disputes.
    - Inconsistent takeoffs lead to unreliable pricing and frustrated teams.
