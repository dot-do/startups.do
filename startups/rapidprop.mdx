  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage boat designs need quick, defensible power curves and propeller
      recommendations to quote and iterate, but existing tools are slow,
      complex, or require detailed geometry not available yet.
    - >-
      Naval architects and yards rely on disparate empirical methods
      (Holtrop-Mennen, Savitsky, Kaper, Bp-Δ, Wageningen B-series), risking
      inconsistent assumptions and errors.
    - >-
      Mis-sized props and under/over-powered combinations cause rework, delays,
      cavitation, and warranty claims, costing $3k–$50k per project.
    - >-
      Small firms often can’t justify expensive, heavy-weight software;
      spreadsheets lack validation and uncertainty bounds.
    - >-
      Engine/prop suppliers need pre-qualification inputs to respond to RFQs;
      back-and-forth stretches quote cycles from days to weeks.
    - >-
      Sea margin and service allowances are inconsistently applied; clients
      challenge budgets without clear, data-backed rationale.
    - >-
      Designers can’t easily quantify accuracy or uncertainty early;
      stakeholders want confidence ranges and sensitivity to displacement,
      speed, and sea state.
    - >-
      Integrations with CAD/PLM stacks are limited; early-stage work happens
      outside those ecosystems, creating copy-paste friction.
    - >-
      No simple way to generate an OEM-ready, traceable calculation report for
      compliance and client sign-off within minutes.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted estimator uses principal particulars (LWL, B, T, Δ, Cp, hull
      form) and desired speed profile to output resistance, power curve, and
      recommended sea margin.
    - >-
      Embedded empirical models: Holtrop-Mennen
      (displacement/semi-displacement), Savitsky (planing), KAPER/Delft series
      where applicable, ITTC ’57 friction line, correlation allowances.
    - >-
      Prop sizing via Bp–Δ and Wageningen B/Kaplan series with open-water
      curves, cavitation checks (σi), tip speed constraints, diameter/gear ratio
      feasibility, and slip estimates.
    - >-
      Automatic allowance builder: sea margin by sea state and fouling, hotel
      loads, growth; provides traceable assumptions and editable presets.
    - >-
      Uncertainty quantification with confidence intervals (e.g., ±8–12% power
      depending on regime) and sensitivity plots for Δ, Cp, and target speed.
    - >-
      One-click OEM-ready PDF and CSV report with traceable methods, inputs, and
      versioning; includes engine/gear options matrix from partnered catalogs.
    - >-
      Integrations: Rhino/Orca3D and Maxsurf push-pull of principal dimensions;
      API for quoting portals of yards/prop shops.

      processing for quotes.

  problem:
    - Early-stage sizing takes days of spreadsheets and guesswork.
    - Manual resistance and sea margin calcs are error-prone.
    - Hard to compare hull forms and propulsion options quickly.

    - 'Stakeholders need numbers now, not after a week of iterations.'
  solution:
    - Instant resistance and powering across your speed range.
    - 'Sea margin and added resistance baked in, not bolted on.'
    - 'Smart propeller sizing with diameter, pitch, and RPM suggestions.'
    - Method selection for hull type with transparent assumptions.
    - Scenario comparison to lock decisions early and reduce rework.
  features:
