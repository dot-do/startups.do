  problem:
    - >-
      Manual process discovery and mapping is slow (6–12 weeks per process),
      expensive ($30k–$150k per process), and highly variable in quality across
      analysts.
    - >-
      SOPs are often outdated or incomplete; logs and interviews live in silos,
      making it hard to build an accurate as-is process map.
    - >-
      Organizations lack a repeatable way to quantify bottlenecks (wait times,
      rework loops, handoff delays) and prioritize improvements with clear ROI.
    - >-
      Process mining tools focus on event logs; they struggle when logs are
      sparse or fragmented and rarely synthesize SOPs and human knowledge into
      BPMN.
    - >-
      Consulting teams spend 40–60% of engagement time on
      discovery/documentation instead of improvement design and change
      execution.
    - >-
      Leadership wants measurable outcomes (cycle time, cost, compliance) within
      a quarter; current approaches often need 6–9 months to show results.
    - >-
      Skill scarcity: certified BPMN/process mining experts are limited, driving
      up costs and turnaround time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and harmonize SOPs, policy docs, wikis, emails, and transcripts;
      parse event logs from ERP/CRM/RPA; auto-align entities (roles, systems,
      SLAs).
    - >-
      Generate as-is BPMN 2.0 models with confidence scoring; detect variants
      and rework loops; auto-create RACI and SIPOC artifacts.
    - >-
      Quantify bottlenecks with queueing and throughput analysis; simulate
      what-if changes (staffing, batching, automation) to estimate impact on
      cycle time and cost.
    - >-
      Recommend improvements with business cases (effort/impact, payback period)
      using benchmarks and learned patterns; export backlog to Jira/ADO.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: analysts can accept/modify steps, gateways, and
      roles; track model lineage and approvals for auditability.
    - >-
      Publish to existing ecosystems (Signavio, Camunda, Visio, Lucid,
      Confluence) and generate stakeholder-ready narratives (executive brief,
      change plan).
    - >-
      Security-by-design: data residency options, PHI/PII detection/redaction,
      SOC 2-ready controls, SSO/SCIM.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From SOPs/logs/interviews to validated BPMN and prioritized improvements in
    days, not months—cut discovery time by 70%, mapping costs by 50%, and
    deliver 10–20% cycle-time reduction within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-source discovery engine that fuses SOPs, event logs, and interview
    transcripts into validated BPMN with audit trails—trained on a proprietary
    corpus of SOP→BPMN pairs and domain ontologies. Human-in-the-loop workflows,
    compliance packs, and ROI-backed recommendations make it a drop-in
    accelerator for consulting teams and BPM CoEs, not just another mining tool.
    Early co-sell partnerships and outcome-based pricing further differentiate.

  problem:
    - Discovery is slow and manual; workshops drag on for weeks.
    - Unstructured SOPs and interviews stay unused or inconsistent.
    - Event logs are noisy; insights are buried in data.
