  problem:
    - >-
      Fabric is 35–60% of total garment cost; a 1% marker-yield loss can erase
      margins on large orders.
    - >-
      Manual or rule-based marker making leaves 1–4% fabric on the table due to
      suboptimal nesting, inconsistent operator skill, and time pressure.
    - >-
      Complex constraints (nap one-way, stripes/plaid matching, piece
      orientation, shrinkage, buffer allowances, bundle ratios) are hard to
      satisfy while maintaining high yield.
    - >-
      Cut plans rarely incorporate real roll maps (varying widths, defects,
      end-loss), creating unexpected waste and rework at the spreader/cutter.
    - >-
      Slow turnaround in CAD rooms (hours/day per style) delays sampling and
      bulk approval, causing missed ship dates or premium freight.
    - >-
      Existing solutions are siloed (CAD/CAM/OEM-specific), making multi-brand,
      multi-plant integration and data consolidation difficult.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop feedback from cutting room to marker optimization
      prevents continuous yield improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or API-push piece shapes (DXF-AAMA/ASTM), fabric width(s), roll
      maps, size ratios, and constraints.
    - >-
      Our AI/optimizer generates optimized markers and cut plans considering
      orientation, nap/stripe plaid matching, buffers, shrinkage, bundles, and
      lay lengths.
    - >-
      Outputs: marker files (DXF-AAMA/ASTM, PLT/HPGL, common OEM formats), cut
      tickets, and yield/cost reports; integrates back to PLM/ERP/CAD.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest cut room feedback (actual consumption, end
      losses, defect bypasses) to continuously improve yields.
    - >-
      Scenario simulation: compare what-if constraints (e.g., relax rotation 5°,
      adjust buffer 1 mm) to quantify savings before change approval.
    - >-
      Multi-plant dashboard for utilization, waste hot-spots, and SKU/fabric
      supplier benchmarks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase fabric utilization by 1.5–3.5% and cut planning throughput by
    50–80% via AI-driven, constraint-aware marker optimization that plugs into
    existing CAD/cutters and returns ready-to-cut marker files and audit-ready
    yield reports.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimizer trained on real cut-room outcomes and roll-map data
    across diverse fabrics and styles, delivered via vendor-agnostic APIs and
    integration kits that let multi-plant groups realize measurable yield gains
    without ripping and replacing existing CAD/cutter stacks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cutting Room and Production Managers at apparel brands and factories who
    must hit yield targets, control fabric cost, and ship on time.
  problem: >-
    External: Fabric is the largest COGS; manual marker making leaves money on
    the table. Complex constraints (grainline, nap/one‑way, stripe/plaid
    matching, buffers, shrinkage, fusing, size mixes, variable fabric widths)
    slow teams and create inconsistency across CAD systems.

    Internal: Pressure to squeeze yield, avoid re-cuts, and keep lines
    fed—without burning out scarce marker-makers.

    Philosophical: No team should overspend on fabric or landfill offcuts when
    smarter layouts are possible.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand cutting rooms live and die by yield, throughput, and
    first‑time‑right markers.

    Authority: Built by apparel IE and cutting veterans; interoperable with
    standard CAD formats (e.g., DXF/AAMA, HPGL/PLT). Secure, enterprise‑ready,
    with clear audit trails and version control. Pilot programs and sample
    markers available.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Upload piece shapes, fabric width, and constraints/size mix (or sync from
    your CAD/PLM).

    2) AI optimizes marker layouts under your rules; returns editable marker
    files, lay plans, and yield reports.

    3) Review/approve and export to your cutter workflow (Gerber, Lectra,
    Optitex, etc.).

    Agreement Plan: You own your files; human override/editing supported; data
    is encrypted; transparent pricing and support; verify yield before cut with
    side‑by‑side reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a trial with your styles.

    Transitional: Download sample marker pack, yield ROI calculator, and the
    Cutting Room Yield Playbook.
  success: >-
    Higher fabric utilization, consistent yields, and faster marker turnaround.
    Lower COGS and waste, increased cutting capacity, on‑time orders, and clear
    sustainability reporting with traceable yield reports per style/lay.
  failure: >-
    Status quo persists: overbuying fabric, offcut waste, overtime and re-cuts,
    missed ship dates, margin erosion, and a larger environmental footprint.
