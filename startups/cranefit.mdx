  problem:
    - >-
      Manual application checks consume 2–6 engineering hours per quote, slowing
      response times and inflating cost of sales.
    - >-
      Late discovery of building/runway constraints leads to redesigns, change
      orders, lost margin, and schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Inconsistent application of CMAA/ASME/OSHA/NFPA/AISC rules across teams
      and dealers creates compliance risk and rework.
    - >-
      Low first-pass yield on proposals (often <50%) due to incomplete customer
      inputs and missed constraints.
    - >-
      Knowledge is trapped in tribal spreadsheets and emails; past quotes aren’t
      leveraged to improve future feasibility checks.
    - >-
      Growing complexity (hazardous locations, seismic/wind, multiple
      crane/runway interactions, monorail curves/switches) strains current
      processes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or ingest customer requirements (capacity, span, lift, duty,
      speeds, environment) and building/runway data (drawings, BIM, photos,
      survey).
    - >-
      Automatically parse geometry and constraints, compute key checks
      (clearances, hook coverage, wheel loads, runway deflection/tolerances,
      electrification, service access).
    - >-
      Apply a versioned, auditable rule base mapped to CMAA 70/74, ASME
      B30.2/16/17, OSHA 1910.179, NFPA 70 Article 610, AISC/ASCE where
      applicable.
    - >-
      Output a feasibility score, pass/fail by category, and a prioritized
      exception/RFI list with suggested mitigations.
    - >-
      Generate customer-ready compliance matrix and sketches for quote packages;
      push results to CPQ/CRM (e.g., Salesforce/Tacton/Configure One).
    - >-
      Continuously learn from outcomes (won/lost, change orders, site issues) to
      improve pre-check accuracy and recommended mitigations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, auditable feasibility and standards pre-check for
    cranes/hoists/monorails that turns messy customer inputs into a clear
    pass/exception report in minutes, cutting quote cycle time by 50–70%,
    raising first-pass yield by 20–30 points, and reducing compliance risk with
    a continuously updated rules engine (CMAA/ASME/OSHA/NFPA/AISC/ASCE).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, versioned compliance engine tied to authoritative
    standards with OEM-calibrated rules, enriched by a growing corpus of
    anonymized application outcomes and exception patterns; defensible via data
    network effects, validated benchmarks with industry partners, and
    auditability suitable for compliance and insurance.

  character: >-
    Engineering, applications, and estimating teams at crane/hoist/monorail OEMs
    and integrators (NAICS 333923) who want to confirm fit and compliance fast
    so they can bid with confidence.
  problem: >-
    Ambiguous site data and fragmented standards (CMAA, ASME B30, OSHA 1910.179,
    IBC/ASCE 7) make feasibility checks slow and error‑prone, causing delayed
    quotes, rework, liability exposure, and lost deals.
  guide: >-
    We understand crane application risk—our SME‑trained AI codifies relevant
    standards and building/runway constraints, backed by compliance engineers,
    to deliver clear, defensible pre‑checks.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload customer requirements and site/runway/building data; 2) AI
    validates against constraints and standards, flagging feasibility,
    exceptions, and assumptions; 3) Receive a concise report with required
    clarifications and suggested alternates; 4) Export results to quoting or
    engineering workflows; 5) Start via low‑risk pilot with data privacy and
    human‑in‑the‑loop review.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and submit a sample job for a free pre‑check;
    alternatively, download the application checklist and standards mapping to
    evaluate offline.
  success: >-
    Faster, more accurate bids; fewer change orders; higher win rates;
    documented compliance trail; safer installations; standardized reviews
    across teams and sites.
  failure: >-
    Slow quoting, costly redesigns, noncompliance and rejected submittals,
    penalties or incidents, and loss of customer trust.
