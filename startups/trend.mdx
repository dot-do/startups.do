  problem:
    - >-
      Design teams spend 6–12 hours per brief manually scanning Pinterest,
      Instagram/TikTok, Reddit, Behance, news, and e‑commerce to spot patterns;
      effort is repetitive and hard to standardize.
    - >-
      Signals are noisy and ephemeral; by the time a trend deck is compiled (1–2
      weeks), half the examples are stale or untraceable to original sources.
    - >-
      Agencies struggle to justify strategic recommendations with defensible,
      real-time evidence and clear audience/market rationale during pitches and
      client reviews.
    - >-
      Inspiration boards often contain unlicensed or ambiguous imagery, creating
      IP and brand-safety risk for clients.
    - >-
      Existing social listening tools surface brand mentions, not design-forward
      opportunity spaces (materials, forms, finishes, micro-aesthetics,
      functional innovations).
    - >-
      Generic AI summarizers lack domain taxonomy, confuse aesthetics with
      demand signals, and cannot produce export-ready creative briefs with
      references and audience hypotheses.
    - >-
      Global teams need region-specific insights (NA/EU/APAC/LatAm) and
      industry-specific patterns; current tools rarely segment signals with
      sufficient granularity.
    - >-
      Leads lost: agencies report 10–20% pitch losses tied to insufficient
      differentiation or thin trend evidence; in-house teams face slower
      time-to-concept and missed seasonal windows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously crawl and ingest multi-modal signals (images, short video
      metadata, text) across design-relevant sources; normalize into a domain
      taxonomy (aesthetics, materials, forms, colors, use-cases).
    - >-
      Apply trend-detection models and build a living knowledge graph linking
      signals → micro-trends → opportunity spaces with recency, velocity, and
      geographic relevance.
    - >-
      Synthesize a concise creative brief (problem/insight, opportunity spaces,
      audiences/personas, references/mood boards, brand implications) with
      traceable citations and licensing-safe assets.
    - >-
      Provide watchlists for categories, audiences, and keywords with
      configurable alerts (weekly snapshots, surge alerts, quarterlies).
    - >-
      Export directly to Figma, Miro, Notion, and PDF; generate pitch-ready
      slides with automated source attributions.
    - >-
      Benchmark ideas: compare your concept to market signals (similarity
      search) to stress-test novelty and fit; flag saturation and whitespace.
    - >-
      Collaborative review: comment, annotate, and score briefs; capture
      outcomes to train a relevance model per team.
    - >-
      Compliance and governance: logs, audit trail, SOC 2-ready, regional data
      handling, and image licensing filters.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on, defensible trend intelligence for designers: mine the web, score
    opportunity spaces, and auto-generate client-ready creative briefs (with
    licensed reference boards and audience hypotheses) in under 10
    minutes—cutting research time by 60%+ and improving pitch win rates and
    concept strike rate.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A living, domain-specific design knowledge graph enriched by continuous
    human-in-the-loop feedback from real project outcomes, coupled with
    license-safe reference generation and deep integrations into designers’
    daily tools—creating higher-quality, defensible briefs that generic AI or
    social listening platforms cannot replicate quickly.
