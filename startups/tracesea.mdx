  problem:
    - >-
      Retail seafood departments and fishmongers must comply with
      jurisdiction-specific labeling laws (e.g., US COOL/NOAA/FDA, EU Reg.
      1379/2013, UK FSA, CFIA), but supplier documents are inconsistent,
      incomplete, and often scanned PDFs, making manual data entry slow and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Non-compliance risks include fines, product relabeling, shrink from pulled
      inventory, and reputational damage; most retailers lack real-time
      validation against rules (e.g., FAO area vs. species vs. gear type) and
      cannot prove due diligence easily during audits.
    - >-
      Scale/printer labels and shelf tags often rely on manual templates,
      leading to inconsistent species names, missing allergens, wrong origins,
      and broken lot links; tracebacks and recalls are slow without standardized
      packs.
    - >-
      Retailers need to link consumer-facing labels to lot/batch, vessel/catch
      area/method, and supplier certificates (MSC/ASC, catch certificates) but
      lack a standardized, automated “pack” to hand to auditors or inspectors.
    - >-
      Existing generic labeling tools (BarTender, NiceLabel) don’t parse seafood
      documents or encode seafood-specific rules; enterprise traceability
      networks don’t generate compliant store labels and daily print files.
    - >-
      Store teams are overburdened; seafood clerks spend 30–90 minutes daily
      creating/updating labels and binders, with high variability across
      locations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest supplier documents (invoices, pack lists, catch certificates, bills
      of lading, spec sheets, MSC/ASC CoC) via email dropbox, portal upload,
      EDI/API, and mobile capture.
    - >-
      AI extraction purpose-built for seafood: OCR + NLP on species, FAO area,
      gear type, production method (wild/farmed), vessel/licence where present,
      country of origin, processing country, allergens, lot/batch, net/gross
      weight, certification IDs, GTIN/UPC.
    - >-
      Compliance rules engine mapping to US COOL/FDA, EU 1379/2013, UK FSA,
      CFIA, including approved species/common names, FAO zone mapping, mandatory
      phrases, allergen statements, font/format rules, and multilingual
      requirements.
    - >-
      Label generation for scale labels, shelf tags, case labels, and e-comm
      PDPs; templates for METTLER TOLEDO, Ishida, Zebra, SATO, and common POS
      exports; WYSIWYG editor with guardrails enforced by the rules engine.
    - >-
      Traceability Pack Builder: bundles label artifact + source docs +
      machine-readable lot linkage (CSV/JSON) + audit summary; one-click export
      to PDF/zip and API for traceability partners.
    - >-
      Validation and enrichment: auto-normalize species (FAO 3-alpha,
      FishBase/ASFIS), map supplier terminology to approved names lists, infer
      missing fields (e.g., FAO area from coordinates) with confidence scores
      and “needs human review” flags.
    - >-
      Workflow and approvals: roles for store, seafood merch, QA/compliance;
      change history, e-sign off, and audit log; alerting when rules or supplier
      certificates change/expire.
    - >-
      Integrations: POS/scale systems, label design tools (NiceLabel/Loftware,
      BarTender), GS1 Digital Link/GTIN data, certification verification APIs
      (MSC/ASC), recall platforms, and data lakes.
    - >-
      Analytics: supplier data quality scorecards, label error rate,
      time-to-label, recall readiness, top exceptions, and regulatory coverage
      by SKU.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From messy supplier docs to compliant labels and a complete, audit-ready
    traceability pack in minutes—auto-parsed, jurisdiction-aware, and integrated
    with your scales, POS, and printers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A seafood-specific labeled dataset and compliance rules engine that improves
    with every processed document, plus deep integrations with scale/POS vendors
    and certification verifiers—creating switching costs and a defensible
    feedback loop most generic label tools and traceability platforms lack.
