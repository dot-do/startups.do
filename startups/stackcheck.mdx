  problem:
    - >-
      Credit union mortgage and HELOC processing relies on manual document
      sorting and keying, consuming 45–120 minutes per file and creating
      bottlenecks in underwriting, post-closing, and QC.
    - >-
      Investor/servicer checklist adherence (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
      FHA/VA/USDA, major servicers) is error-prone; missing or mis-indexed docs
      lead to conditions, suspense, purchase delays, and
      repurchase/indemnification risk.
    - >-
      Existing OCR tools are generic or expensive and lack mortgage-specific
      taxonomies and investor rules; many require deep IT lift or lock CUs into
      single LOS ecosystems.
    - >-
      Staffing shortages and seasonality make turnaround times volatile;
      small-to-mid size CUs cannot scale QC cost-effectively.
    - >-
      Compliance requirements (GLBA, SOC 2, data residency) and auditability
      limit the use of off-the-shelf AI without strong controls and
      explainability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest loan packages via API, SFTP, LOS connectors, and watch folders;
      auto-classify 200+ mortgage/HELOC document types and index into the
      LOS/ECM.
    - >-
      Extract 400+ fields (borrower, collateral, income, compliance dates, fees)
      with confidence scores; auto-normalize units, dates, and amounts.
    - >-
      Run investor/servicer checklist QA (Fannie, Freddie, FHA/VA/USDA, GNMA,
      top servicers) with pre-mapped rules; generate exceptions and
      ready-to-clear conditions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop validation station with thresholding by field risk;
      one-click accept/correct; all edits audit-logged for QC evidence.
    - >-
      Exception dashboards and loan-level audit packs exportable to ACES or LOS;
      trailing-doc detector and stale/expired doc alerts.
    - >-
      Model feedback loop and assisted labeling to continuously improve accuracy
      on each CU’s paper and e-sign templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut loan file touch time and checklist defects by more than half with
    mortgage-native AI that classifies docs, extracts 400+ key fields, and
    auto-checks investor/servicer rules—built for credit union LOS stacks,
    priced per file, and deployable in weeks with audit-ready evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt, continuously maintained investor/servicer checklist library plus
    200+ doc-type taxonomy and 400+ field mappings tuned for credit union
    workflows; certified LOS connectors and a human-in-the-loop layer that
    delivers audit-ready evidence with measurable ROI in weeks. Data-network
    effects from aggregated, anonymized error patterns improve checklist
    accuracy for all CUs while preserving privacy.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Credit union mortgage/HELOC teams who must deliver investor‑ready files
    quickly with small staffs and strict compliance.
  problem: >-
    - External: Loan packages arrive inconsistent; key data is buried across
    PDFs; checklists differ by investor, servicer, and state.

    - Internal: Teams waste hours renaming, keying fields, and chasing trailing
    docs; errors slip through.

    - Philosophical: Technology should remove checklist drudgery—not add another
    system to babysit.
