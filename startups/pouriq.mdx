  problem:
    - >-
      Daily reports are time-consuming and inconsistent: foremen spend 30–60
      minutes/day compiling deliveries, crew hours, weather, and photos; error
      rates in manual entry commonly exceed 10%.
    - >-
      Concrete QC data is fragmented: mix tickets, e-tickets, lab results, and
      photos live in different systems, making root-cause analysis and
      compliance audits slow (often >2 hours/job/week).
    - >-
      Late detection of QC exceptions (e.g., out-of-spec slump/air/temperature,
      delayed placement, missing curing records) leads to rework, schedule
      impacts, and back-charges; exceptions are often discovered days later.
    - >-
      Documentation gaps reduce claim defensibility: missing weather logs,
      delivery timestamps, or photo evidence undermines change orders and delay
      claims.
    - >-
      Current tools (generic daily reports) don’t interpret concrete-specific
      data (batch tickets, cylinders, pump logs), requiring duplicate data entry
      and expert review on every job.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse and normalize concrete delivery tickets (photos and e-tickets) to
      auto-fill quantities, mix IDs, batch times, truck arrival/pour times,
      slump/air/temperature, and placement locations.
    - >-
      Ingest field photos and classify them (rebar, formwork, placement,
      finishing, curing, anchors/embeds) with time and geo-tagging; map photos
      to work areas and report sections.
    - >-
      Auto-attach certified weather logs (start/stop, temp, humidity,
      precipitation, wind) and correlate to pours for claims and curing
      requirements.
    - >-
      QC rules engine: real-time exception flags for spec variances
      (slump/air/temp), ticket-to-placement delays beyond limits, missing
      cylinders, insufficient rebar cover evidence, unfinished curing
      documentation, and cold/hot weather concreting checklists.
    - >-
      Generate standardized, GC-ready daily reports with edits and approvals on
      mobile and web; push to Procore/Autodesk Build daily logs; export PDF with
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Integrations: e-ticket providers (Command Alkon/WMC), Procore/Autodesk
      Build/Raken, testing labs (MetaField/ForneyVault), cloud storage
      (Box/OneDrive/SharePoint), chat (Teams/Slack) for exception alerts.
    - >-
      Analytics: pour productivity, crew utilization, variance vs. mix design,
      exception frequency by project/vendor, and evidence packs for change
      orders.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, concrete-specific daily reporting and real-time QC exception
    detection. Turn 45 minutes of manual reporting into 3 minutes, with
    proactive flags for out-of-spec mixes, delayed placements, and missing
    documentation—reducing rework and protecting margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Concrete-specialized AI with a growing proprietary corpus of tickets,
    photos, and QC outcomes tied to real exceptions, plus deep integrations with
    e-ticketing and lab systems. This yields earlier, higher-precision QC alerts
    and defensible, source-linked reports that generic daily-report tools cannot
    match.
