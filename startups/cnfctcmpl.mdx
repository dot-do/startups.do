  problem:
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity: Nonchocolate confectionery labels must satisfy
      differing rules across US (21 CFR 101), EU (Reg. 1169/2011 and
      country-level addenda), and Canada (FDR, bilingual), creating costly
      manual work and high error risk.
    - >-
      Frequent changes: EU titanium dioxide (E171) ban, evolving fiber/added
      sugar definitions, CFIA nutrition table changes, and claim rules (e.g.,
      “sugar-free,” polyol laxative warning) require continuous updates
      manufacturers struggle to track.
    - >-
      Inefficient workflows: R&D, QA/RA, marketing, and co-packers iterate
      labels via spreadsheets, PDFs, and email. Cycle time per SKU often 4–8
      hours with multiple handoffs and rework.
    - >-
      Claim risk: “No added sugar,” “vegan,” “natural color,” and
      allergen/allergen-derivative disclosures (e.g., carmine, shellac) lead to
      recalls and reputational damage; validation is manual and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Scaling SKUs/markets: Seasonal items, pack-size variants, and
      private-label lines create dozens of label permutations; updating
      nutrition rounding and country-specific statements at scale is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Audit preparedness: Poor recordkeeping and version control complicate GFSI
      audits and retailer documentation requests, increasing compliance costs
      and jeopardizing listings.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted formula-to-label engine: Parse recipes/spec sheets, map to
      approved ingredient names (US common/usual, EU QUID rules, CFIA naming),
      bold allergens per region, and auto-generate net quantity statements.
    - >-
      Automated nutrition panels: Compute per serving/100 g/kJ-kcal, apply
      region-specific rounding/formatting, bilingual (EN/FR for Canada), and
      pack-size variants; output printer-ready templates.
    - >-
      Claims checker: Validate nutrition and marketing claims (sugar-free,
      reduced sugar, high fiber, vegan, natural flavors/colors) against
      jurisdictional thresholds and prohibitions; flag polyol and aspartame
      warnings, sweetener front-of-pack statements, and QUID triggers.
    - >-
      Regulatory rules engine: Continuously updated confectionery-specific rules
      (color additives incl. TiO2 alternatives, glazing agents,
      carmine/Cochineal allergen labeling in EU, US FALCPA, CFIA) with change
      logs and effective dates.
    - >-
      Label versioning and audit trail: SKU-level history, approvals,
      attachments (COAs, supplier specs), and exportable compliance dossiers for
      audits and retailers.
    - >-
      Integrations and print: APIs and connectors for PLM/ERP (TraceGains,
      Specright), NiceLabel/Loftware templates, GS1 data, and SmartLabel/QR for
      digital disclosure.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One platform that turns confectionery formulas into fully compliant,
    print-ready labels for US/EU/CA—automatically generating ingredient
    statements, bilingual nutrition panels, and claim validations—reducing label
    cycle time by 70%+ and cutting compliance errors to <1%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A confectionery-focused regulatory knowledge graph and test suite built from
    thousands of anonymized SKUs, paired with attorney-reviewed rules for
    sweeteners, colorants, and allergen derivatives—delivering higher accuracy
    on candy-specific edge cases (polyols, glazing agents, QUID, bilingual
    nuances) than generalist food labeling tools. Early integrations with
    PLM/label printing ecosystems create switching costs.
  customerSegments:
