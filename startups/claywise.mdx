  problem:
    - >-
      Formulation development and optimization for clay bodies and refractories
      rely on expert intuition and lengthy trial-and-error, leading to 8–20
      lab/plant iterations per new product or raw-material change.
    - >-
      Raw material variability (moisture, LOI, particle size distribution,
      mineralogy) drives unpredictable absorption, MOR, shrinkage, thermal shock
      resistance, and refractoriness; supplier and quarry variability create
      frequent recipe drift.
    - >-
      Kiln time is the bottleneck: each test firing adds 2–7 days to development
      and qualification cycles, delaying revenue and consuming energy.
    - >-
      Tight customer specs (ASTM C20/C133/C326/C38/C24-aligned) and narrow
      process windows force conservative recipes that are overengineered and
      higher cost than needed.
    - >-
      Workforce demographics: many plants are losing senior formulators; tacit
      knowledge is not codified, causing quality risk and longer onboarding for
      new engineers.
    - >-
      Cost pressure and decarbonization targets require lower-firing or
      shorter-cycle recipes without sacrificing properties, yet the search space
      (oxides/minerals/binders/temper/sintering schedules) is combinatorially
      large.
    - >-
      Existing tools (spreadsheets, generic DOE/ML) are not tuned to ceramics
      physics, don’t quantify uncertainty, and don’t integrate with LIMS/MES or
      kiln data to close the loop.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest historical recipes, raw material certificates, process parameters,
      and test results from LIMS/MES/ERP; auto-clean and feature-engineer
      mineral/oxide composition, PSD, LOI, moisture, and firing schedule
      attributes.
    - >-
      Property prediction models (absorption, MOR, apparent porosity, bulk
      density, linear shrinkage, refractoriness under load, thermal shock
      proxies) trained with uncertainty quantification for trustworthy guidance.
    - >-
      Bayesian multi-objective optimization to recommend new formulations and
      firing schedules meeting targets and constraints (ASTM windows, cost
      ceilings, firing temperature/time limits, supplier availability).
    - >-
      Active learning and automated Design of Experiments: minimal set of
      confirmatory tests ranked by expected information gain to validate and
      refine models.
    - >-
      Supplier variability modeling: simulate material drift; propose robust
      recipes and substitution plans with quantified risk and cost impact.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration: capture lab results, kiln logs, and inline
      measurements; update models automatically and trigger recipe
      re-qualification suggestions.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning: cost/CO2/energy trade-offs across alternative
      materials and firing profiles with sensitivity analysis and confidence
      bands.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Physics-informed Bayesian optimization that turns plant and lab data into
    optimal, ready-to-fire recipes meeting property and cost targets with fewer
    experiments—cutting development time 30–50%, scrap 10–20%, and raw material
    costs 2–5%, while capturing expert knowledge in a repeatable system.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, physics-informed Bayesian optimization stack trained on a
    growing, privacy-preserving, cross-plant dataset of ceramic formulations and
    kiln outcomes—plus deep integrations into LIMS/MES and kiln
    controllers—enables faster cold starts, robust recipes against supplier
    variability, and auditable, standards-aligned recommendations that generic
    ML tools cannot match.

    Manufacturing and R&D leaders at NAICS 327120 companies who must deliver
    clay body and refractory formulations that hit absorption, MOR, shrinkage,
    refractoriness, and cost targets without endless trial-and-error.
  problem: >-
    External: Raw material variability, costly lab cycles, and conflicting specs
    make recipe development slow and risky. Internal: Pressure to cut
    time-to-qualification and protect margins with limited resources.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess recipes when your data can guide
    you.
  guide: >-
    We understand that every failed firing ties up kilns and budgets. Our team
    of materials scientists and data engineers has applied Bayesian optimization
    in ceramics and refractories to turn scattered lab and production data into
    reliable formulation recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your historical data and define targets/constraints. 2) Our
    Bayesian optimizer models property responses and proposes next-best
    formulations with uncertainty and trade-off insights. 3) Validate with a
    focused DoE, lock the recipe, and monitor performance as materials drift.
