  problem:
    - >-
      High melt-loss during hot months (3–10% of product volume) erodes margins;
      loss is untracked and unoptimized in routing decisions.
    - >-
      Manual or generic route planning ignores heat exposure, truck insulation
      performance, and time windows, causing late deliveries and stock-outs at
      retail.
    - >-
      Fuel and driver overtime costs are elevated due to suboptimal routes and
      re-routes (8–20% avoidable).
    - >-
      Dispatcher planning time is excessive (1–3 hours daily) and error-prone
      during seasonal demand spikes.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into real-time product-to-ice remaining, stop service
      levels, and dynamic capacity as melt changes available inventory.
    - >-
      Retailers require strict delivery windows; missed windows incur penalties
      and lost shelf space.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack: telematics, route planning, and ERP/route
      accounting don’t share thermal or weather context.
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine purpose-built for ice: VRPTW/CVRP with time-dependent
      travel times, truck capacity, and heat exposure penalties based on
      forecasted and real-time weather.
    - >-
      Thermal/melt-loss model that accounts for solar irradiance, ambient
      temperature, humidity, wind, door-open events, truck insulation R-value,
      and dwell times.
    - >-
      Dispatcher console: import orders/time windows, simulate scenarios (start
      times, depot loading sequence), get optimized routes with cost vs
      melt-loss tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Driver mobile app (Android/iOS): turn-by-turn navigation, time-window
      countdown, digital POD, temperature/dwell capture, exception reporting.
    - >-
      Dynamic re-optimization: adapt to delays, traffic, weather swings;
      preserve time windows and prioritize melt-sensitive loads.
    - >-
      Integrations: telematics (GPS/ELD), weather APIs, mapping, ERPs/route
      accounting (orders, invoices, POD sync), and inventory systems.
    - >-
      Seasonality controls: on/offboard trucks, auto-adjust service frequencies
      by demand and temperature bands.
    - >-
      Analytics/ROI dashboard: melt-loss per route/stop, service level,
      utilization, fuel/mi, cost per 1,000 lbs delivered, driver hours, on-time
      %.
    - >-
      Compliance and governance: audit logs, roles/permissions, SOC 2 road-map,
      data retention controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut melt-loss and fuel with weather-aware, capacity-constrained routing that
    models heat exposure and truck insulation—delivering up to 20–40% melt-loss
    reduction, 8–15% fuel savings, and 98%+ on-time delivery while shrinking
    planning time by 70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, validated thermal/melt-loss model fused into routing
    decisions, trained on real ice delivery telemetry across climates; combined
    with deep integrations to ice ERPs and telematics creates switching costs
    and defensibility. Early case studies and a dataset competitors lack enable
    superior results and faster deployments.

  character: >-
    Ice manufacturers and route managers who must hit delivery windows while
    protecting margins from melt-loss and fuel waste.
  problem: >-
    External: Daily routing is constrained by strict time windows, heat
    exposure, and truck capacity—driving melt-loss and miles. Internal: Teams
    are stuck firefighting and guessing which stops risk product loss.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between on-time service and
    delivering solid ice.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand every extra minute in the heat turns into lost pounds
    and profits. Authority: Built by logistics and OR/ML veterans; field-tested
    with ice plants; integrates with telematics and temp sensors; secure and
    compliant data handling; references available.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect orders, depots, truck specs/capacity, and delivery time
    windows 2) Configure heat-exposure penalties, driver shifts, SLAs, and load
    rules 3) Generate daily optimized routes and load plans; re-optimize as
    orders or weather change 4) Dispatch to drivers and monitor KPIs. Agreement:
    Clear ROI targets, pilot timeline, success criteria, and white-glove
    onboarding.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute route audit and pilot kickoff. Transitional:
    Download the Melt-Loss Calculator and Route Optimization Playbook.

    lower fuel and overtime; predictable margins; happier customers and drivers;
    smaller carbon footprint.
  failure: >-
