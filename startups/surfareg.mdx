  problem:
    - >-
      Manual dossier assembly in IUCLID and SDS authoring takes 4–40 hours per
      product or substance and must be redone with every formulation or
      regulation change.
    - >-
      Mixture classification per CLP/GHS is error-prone and inconsistent across
      jurisdictions; harmonized classifications and bridging principles are
      often misapplied.
    - >-
      Keeping up with REACH, TSCA (PMN, SNUR, Inventory), and evolving GHS/CLP
      updates across 30+ countries overwhelms small/mid-size surfactant
      manufacturers.
    - >-
      UVCB surfactants and complex mixtures (e.g., alkoxylates, quats,
      sulfonates) complicate boundary composition, impurity profiles, and
      acute/chronic aquatic classification.
    - >-
      Disparate data lives in LIMS/ERP/spreadsheets; lack of integration creates
      duplicate data entry, version control issues, and audit risk.
    - >-
      Consultant-led workflows are slow and expensive (>$150/hr), with limited
      knowledge retention in-house.
    - >-
      Regulatory submissions fail completeness checks due to missing/incorrect
      section mapping, study summaries, and metadata in IUCLID.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of product compositions (CAS/EC, ranges, impurities)
      and hazard data; normalization against authoritative inventories (ECHA
      C&L, REACH Annex VI, TSCA Inventory).
    - >-
      Explainable mixture classification engine implementing CLP/GHS rules,
      additivity formulas, bridging principles, and aquatic toxicity tiers with
      surfactant-specific heuristics.
    - >-
      Multi-jurisdiction SDS generator (Sections 1–16) with localized phrases
      and regulatory variants (EU REACH Annex II, OSHA HazCom 2012/2024 updates,
      WHMIS, GB-CLP, LATAM, APAC).
    - >-
      IUCLID 6 dossier auto-builder: maps composition, endpoint study summaries,
      uses and exposure descriptors, boundary composition/UVCB rationale;
      pre-validates for completeness checks.
    - >-
      TSCA workflows: Inventory status check, PMN data mapping, CDR tagging,
      SNUR/PMN flagging; auto-building of data fields from available tox/ecotox
      and use patterns.
    - >-
      Continuous rule/content updates with change alerts and automated SDS
      re-issuance; redlining and version control for audits.
    - >-
      Integrations (SAP, Oracle, Odoo, LIMS) and API for bulk operations; export
      to PDF/Word/XML, label artwork generation, and document control.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
