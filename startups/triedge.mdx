  problem:
    - >-
      Maintenance teams drown in raw fault codes and alerts from vehicles
      (CAN/TCMS/PLC) without clear prioritization, causing slow response and
      missed critical issues.
    - >-
      High rate of repeat defects and “no fault found” work orders due to poor
      triage quality and lack of structured root-cause guidance.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across telematics, EAM/CMMS, parts inventory, and in-depot
      diagnostics leads to manual, error-prone triage and scheduling.
    - >-
      Limited staff and long shift turnovers create inconsistent triage
      decisions; institutional knowledge isn’t codified or shared efficiently.
    - >-
      Unplanned service interruptions drive penalties and lower on-time
      performance and fleet availability.
    - >-
      OEM analytics are siloed per fleet and lack cross-OEM visibility; CMMS
      analytics often don’t operate at real-time fault ingestion speed.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest vehicle fault/event feeds (CAN/TCMS/PLC), wayside, and depot
      diagnostics in real time; normalize with OEM-agnostic decoders.
    - >-
      Score each new fault on severity, safety risk, and service impact using a
      hybrid rules+ML model trained on historical outcomes.
    - >-
      Generate an explainable triage recommendation (likely root cause, part(s),
      skill, estimated time) with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Auto-create and prioritize work orders in the customer’s EAM/CMMS (Maximo,
      Infor EAM, SAP PM, Trapeze) including labor, parts, and SLA due times.
    - >-
      Dynamic scheduling assist: slot work against fleet pull windows and
      vehicle duty cycles; suggest swaps to protect peak service.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture outcomes (resolved/not, time to fix, parts
      actually used) to continuously improve models and playbooks.
    - >-
      Warranty/recall assist: flag cases likely covered by warranty; attach
      evidence and expedite claims.
    - >-
      Governance and safety: audit trails, role-based approvals, and change logs
      for union and safety compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From raw fault code to scheduled fix in minutes: TriEdge AI scores fault
    severity and service impact, recommends the next best action, and
    auto-creates prioritized, explainable work orders in your CMMS—reducing MTTR
    20–40% and repeat defects 15–30%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-agency, cross-OEM fault knowledge base with closed-loop outcome
    learning embedded in CMMS workflows creates compounding model performance
    and faster ROI than OEM-specific or analytics-only tools; procurement
    readiness (security/compliance) reduces time-to-contract.
  customerSegments:
    - Urban light rail and streetcar operators (50–300 vehicles per agency).
