  problem:
    - >-
      Executives struggle to translate strategy into aligned, measurable OKRs
      across departments and teams; the process is slow (4–8 weeks per cycle)
      and error-prone.
    - >-
      KPI definitions are inconsistent across functions and regions, causing
      misaligned reporting and debates over “one source of truth.”
    - >-
      Consulting firms spend billable time manually facilitating OKR workshops,
      drafting cascades, and building KPI dictionaries and dashboards from
      scratch, compressing margins.
    - >-
      Dashboards often visualize activity metrics instead of true outcome KPIs;
      data lineage and owners are unclear, delaying decisions.
    - >-
      OKR adoption stalls because teams lack role-specific examples, target
      benchmarks, and integration into daily tools (Jira, Asana, Slack, BI).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted cascade: Ingest top-level goals (docs, decks, transcripts) and
      map them to function-specific OKRs for each department/team with target
      ranges and leading/lagging indicators.
    - >-
      KPI dictionary generator: Create standardized KPI definitions (name,
      formula, owner, frequency, data source, thresholds) aligned to OKRs, with
      lineage and governance workflows.
    - >-
      Dashboard templates: Auto-generate Looker/Power BI/Tableau templates that
      bind to common data models (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift) and surface
      OKR-aligned KPIs by role.
    - >-
      Review and governance workflow: Stakeholder review, quality scoring,
      approvals, and versioning; audit trails and RACI assignment for KPIs/OKRs.
    - >-
      Integrations: Sync OKRs to OKR platforms (Viva Goals, Quantive, WorkBoard,
      Perdoo), tasks to Jira/Asana, nudges to Slack/Teams; push metrics to BI;
      pull data catalogs from Collibra/Alation.
    - >-
      Change management kit: Auto-generated rollout plan, comms, QBR/MBR
      agendas, coaching prompts, and team-level examples to drive adoption.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: What-if impacts of target changes on downstream teams
      and dashboards; sensitivity analysis on KPI thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From CEO goals to cascaded, high-quality team OKRs and a governed KPI
    dictionary with ready-to-use dashboard templates—in days, not
    weeks—integrated into your existing OKR, work, and BI stack.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary KPI ontology and cascade engine enriched by partner-sourced
    templates and anonymized benchmark data, plus deep integrations that
    generate BI-ready dashboards and enforce governance—positioning CascadeIQ as
    the glue between strategy, work, and data rather than just another OKR
    tracker.

  character: >-
    Management consultants and strategy leaders who need to translate executive
    goals into clear, aligned department and team OKRs with a coherent KPI set
    and ready‑to‑use dashboards.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual cascading is slow, inconsistent, and political; KPIs are
    undefined or duplicated; dashboards don’t align to outcomes. Internal:
    Pressure to show quick wins and authority without burning billable hours.
    Philosophical: Alignment should be simple, transparent, and measurable for
    everyone.
  guide: >-
    We understand the friction of OKR rollouts and the chaos of KPI sprawl. Our
    AI applies proven OKR patterns and metric taxonomies, tracing every key
    result to a goal with clear owners, formulas, and data sources.
  plan: >-
    1) Input top‑level goals and constraints. 2) Generate department/team OKRs,
    a KPI dictionary, and dashboard templates. 3) Review, edit, and export to
    your PM/BI stack; iterate with versioned updates.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Explore a sample cascade
    and KPI dictionary for a common strategy theme.
  success: >-
    Faster engagements, consistent OKRs across teams, a single source of truth
    for KPIs, dashboards that show outcomes not activity, and stakeholders
    aligned in days—not months.
  failure: >-
    Endless workshops, spreadsheet drift, vanity metrics, misaligned dashboards,
    missed targets, and eroded client trust.
