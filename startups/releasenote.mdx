  problem:
    - >-
      Teams spend 1–3 hours per release compiling accurate notes from
      commits/PRs/issues; the work is repetitive, error-prone, and often slips
      release deadlines.
    - >-
      PR titles and commit messages are inconsistent; mapping to
      customer-friendly language and categories
      (Features/Fixes/Breaking/Deprecations) requires deep context and manual
      editing.
    - >-
      Multi-repo/monorepo and microservices make it hard to assemble a coherent
      product-level changelog across repos and components.
    - >-
      Risk of leaking sensitive data (internal ticket IDs, customer names,
      secrets) in public release notes; current processes lack redaction and
      approval safeguards.
    - >-
      Release notes are published inconsistently across channels (GitHub/GitLab
      releases, docs, in-app changelog, Confluence, email, RSS, App Store/Play)
      causing fragmented communication.
    - >-
      Regulated/SOC2 environments need audit trails, approvals, and traceability
      between releases, issues, and change requests; current tooling is ad hoc.
    - >-
      International users need localized notes; manual translation is slow,
      expensive, and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Lack of analytics: teams cannot measure adoption, accuracy, time saved, or
      the quality of notes; no continuous improvement loop.
  solution:
    - >-
      Native connectors to GitHub/GitLab/Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps to ingest
      commits, PRs, issues, labels, and releases; build a cross-repo change
      graph per version.
    - >-
      AI classification and summarization to group changes
      (feat/fix/chore/security/breaking/deprecation), deduplicate PRs/commits,
      and map to components and product areas.
    - >-
      Governance: redaction filters (secrets/PII), style-guide templates,
      required approvers, and scheduled publish windows; auditable change logs
      with links to source.
    - >-
      Multi-channel publishing: GitHub/GitLab Releases, Markdown changelog
      in-repo, Docusaurus/MkDocs/ReadMe, Confluence/Notion, RSS/Atom,
      Slack/Teams, email, App Store/Play notes.
    - >-
      Semantic versioning helper and breaking-change detector; recommends
      patch/minor/major and highlights migration steps.
    - >-
      Localization via integrated MT (e.g., DeepL) with glossary support for
      product terminology; human-in-the-loop review where required.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: time saved, acceptance/edit rates, coverage of
      PRs->notes, publishing latency, per-channel delivery success, quality
      scores.
    - >-
      Deployment choices: SaaS with SOC2; private cloud/VPC and on-prem Helm
      charts for enterprises; SSO/SCIM, RBAC, and data residency options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, policy-safe, multi-channel release notes that are accurate,
    consistent, and traceable—from code to customer. Save 1–3 hours per release,
    cut errors and leaks, and publish everywhere automatically with audit-ready
    approvals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, high-quality dataset of commit/PR/issue→release-note
    pairs with human acceptance feedback and edit diffs, enabling superior
    accuracy and style adherence. Cross-repo change graph plus policy-safe
    redaction and governance tuned for enterprise workflows. Early marketplace
    distribution, SOC2 readiness, and partner templates create switching costs
    competitors lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Software publishers (NAICS 513210)—release managers, PMs, and maintainers
    who need clear, accurate release notes without slowing development.
  problem: >-
    External: Manually compiling notes from commits/PRs/issues is slow,
    inconsistent, and error‑prone. Internal: Teams dread release day and fear
    missing critical changes. Philosophical: Users deserve transparent
    changelogs; engineers should build, not summarize.
  guide: >-
    We’ve felt release pressure and built an AI agent that reliably turns
    commits, PRs, and issues into accurate notes with traceable links. Proven on
    real repos; read‑only access; audit trail; enterprise security practices.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect GitHub/GitLab and docs; choose templates and labels. 2) Agent
    drafts grouped notes (features, fixes, breaking), cites PRs/issues, and
    proposes highlights. 3) Review/approve and auto‑publish to GitHub/GitLab
    Releases and docs; notify subscribers.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Install the GitHub/GitLab app and start a 14‑day trial.
    Transitional: View a sample changelog, watch a 2‑minute demo, or run a
    one‑release pilot.
  success: >-
    Consistent, trustworthy release notes and searchable changelogs published
    everywhere your users look; faster releases; fewer support tickets;
    audit‑ready traceability; devs regain hours each release.
  failure: >-
    Vague or incorrect notes, missed breaking changes, frustrated users, more
    support load, compliance gaps, and eroded trust with every release.

  problem:
    - Engineers lose hours per release compiling notes.
    - Inconsistent tone and missed changes across PRs and issues.
    - Risky disclosures or vague summaries slip to customers.

    - 'Select repos and sources (commits, PRs, issues).'
    - Choose template and taxonomy rules.
    - Generate draft; review and refine with suggestions.
    - Approve and auto-publish to releases and docs.
    - Notify teams via Slack/Teams and publish RSS.
