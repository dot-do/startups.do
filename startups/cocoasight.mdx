  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on tempering, enrobing, molding, cooling tunnels, and
      packaging caused by viscosity drift, belt misalignment, feeder jams, and
      raw material variability leads to 3–7% OEE loss per line.
    - >-
      High scrap/rework due to tempering issues (fat bloom), cooling tunnel
      dew-point mismanagement (sugar bloom), shell release failures,
      misfills/miswraps, and allergen cross-contact; typical chocolate lines see
      1–3% yield loss that is preventable.
    - >-
      Manual or inaccurate downtime coding and siloed data (PLC/SCADA, MES,
      LIMS, ERP, lab, ambient sensors) make root cause analysis slow (often 1–3
      days) and reactive.
    - >-
      Alarm floods and microstops (sub-60s events) are under-reported; operators
      cannot reliably correlate setpoints, ambient humidity, and bean lot
      attributes to performance.
    - >-
      Batch-to-batch variability in cocoa beans (origin, roast profile, fat
      content) requires adaptive setpoints, but most plants use static recipes;
      this causes frequent minor stops and scrap during shift changes and
      seasonal humidity swings.
    - >-
      Limited, generic analytics tools require expert data scientists; plants
      need prescriptive guidance (checklists and next best actions) that
      operators can apply in minutes.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability obligations (GFSI, SQF/BRC) require auditable
      decisions and corrective actions, but many checks are paper-based and not
      linked to process data.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline: connectors for PLC/SCADA (OPC UA), historians
      (PI/AVEVA, Ignition), MES/ERP (SAP, Rockwell, Siemens), LIMS/lab results
      (viscosity, moisture, water activity), ambient sensors
      (humidity/temperature), energy meters.
    - >-
      Automated OEE and downtime model: real-time event detection, microstop
      clustering, and auto-coding of stop reasons using machine learning
      (pattern matching on speed, torque, current, vibration).
    - >-
      Anomaly detection: unsupervised models (isolation forest, robust STL),
      multivariate drift detection (viscosity-temperature-speed), and spectral
      analysis for vibration signatures on conches, refiners, and wrappers.
    - >-
      Causal correlation engine: chocolate-specific knowledge graph linking bean
      lot → roast profile → conche time → viscosity → temper curve → cooling
      tunnel dew point → wrapper speed to identify likely root causes.
    - >-
      Prescriptions and checklists: operator-facing, machine-specific
      recommendations (e.g., “Increase temper set by 0.3°C; verify scrape blade
      wear; check cooling tunnel RH ≤45%”), with digital sign-offs and photos.
    - >-
      Batch genealogy and traceability: tie anomalies and actions to batch lots
      for CAPA and audit trails; export to QMS.
    - >-
      Edge and cloud options: on-prem edge gateway with offline buffering,
      low-latency alerts; cloud analytics and fleet benchmarking with role-based
      access and SSO.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box chocolate templates: tempering, enrobing, molding, cooling,
      and wrapping dashboards; bloom risk score; seasonal humidity compensation;
      allergen changeover compliance aide.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built anomaly detection and prescriptive guidance for chocolate
    manufacturing from cacao beans. CocoaSight AI correlates OEE, downtime, and
    scrap with context (bean origin, roast profile, viscosity, temper curves,
    dew point, operator, recipe, and equipment health) to prevent quality
    defects and stoppages. Achieve +3–8 OEE points, 15–30% reduction in
    unplanned downtime, and 10–20% scrap reduction within 90 days, with
    auditable checklists and <4-week time-to-value.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    library, pretrained on tempering/enrobing/molding/cooling anomalies and
    validated by ex-Hershey/Mars/Lindt engineers; OEM co-development for sensor

  character: >-
    Ops leaders, CI managers, and line supervisors at chocolate & confectionery
    plants (NAICS 311351) who want stable, high‑OEE lines with fewer surprises.
    They need early warning on downtime and scrap, clear root causes, and
    operator‑ready checklists—without hiring data scientists.
  problem: >-
    - External: Unplanned stops and scrap spikes from tempering drift, cooling
    tunnel imbalance, enrober jams, wrapper misfeeds, grinder wear, and
    changeover/allergen sanitation overruns; data scattered across PLC/SCADA,
    historians, MES, CMMS, and QMS.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting, blind spots across shifts, slow
    root‑cause hunts, QA holds, and missed schedules—especially during seasonal
    peaks.

    - Philosophical: Making premium chocolate shouldn’t rely on guesswork; teams
    deserve objective, real‑time clarity to protect brand and margins.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know molten chocolate is unforgiving—tiny drifts can mean
    hours of scrap and missed orders.

    - Authority: Built by manufacturing‑AI practitioners with food &
    confectionery experience; detects anomalies in OEE, downtime, and scrap,
    correlates with context, and suggests root causes and operator checklists.
    Integrates with PLC/SCADA tags, historians, MES/ERP, CMMS; supports
    HACCP/SQF workflows and preserves OT security (read‑only, ISA‑95 aligned).
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Connect: Ingest tags/sensors, historian, MES/QMS/CMMS context.
      2) Learn: Baseline OEE, downtime, and scrap by product, mold, line, and shift.
      3) Go Live: Real‑time anomaly alerts with cause suggestions and operator checklists.
      4) Improve: Daily/weekly reviews, playbook updates, and continuous model tuning.
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Read‑only to control systems; no PLC logic changes.
      - Data residency honored; enterprise security (SOC 2‑ready).
      - Clear success criteria and ROI targets before pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30‑minute line assessment and start a 30‑day pilot on one
    line.

    - Transitional: Get an anomaly heatmap sample, ROI estimate, and
    chocolate‑specific checklist pack (tempering, enrobing, cooling tunnel,
    wrapping).
  success: |-
    - 3–7% OEE lift within 90 days.
    - 15–30% scrap reduction on molding/packaging.
    - 20–50% faster root‑cause resolution and fewer QA holds.
    - Stabilized tempering and cooling reduce bloom/texture complaints.
    - Documented checklists that pass audits and speed onboarding.
    - Confident seasonal ramps with on‑time shipments and stronger margins.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing fire drills and missed Halloween/Valentine’s/Easter orders.
    - Wasted premium cocoa mass, inclusions, and packaging.
    - Allergen changeover risks, CAPA backlog, and audit pain.
    - Operator burnout, finger‑pointing, and rising cost per case.
    - Lost shelf space and market share to more predictable competitors.
