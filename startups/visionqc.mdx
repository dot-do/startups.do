  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or semi-automated visual inspection misses intermittent print,
      die-cut, and gluing defects at production speeds above 150 m/min, creating
      scrap, rework, and risk of customer returns or recalls.
    - >-
      High variability across SKUs, substrates, and inks drives frequent model
      re-tuning for rule-based vision systems, causing downtime and engineering
      overhead.
    - >-
      Operators face inspection fatigue and inconsistent defect classification;
      QC documentation is often incomplete or not traceable to lots/rolls,
      hindering root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Existing inline inspection systems are capital-intensive, vendor-locked,
      and hard to retrofit; many plants lack real-time defect alerts or
      closed-loop reject triggering.
    - >-
      Gluing verification (presence, placement, bead width) is unreliable
      without UV additives; print color shift and misregistration drift are
      detected too late (post-run).
    - >-
      Quality KPIs (FPY, scrap rate, CoPQ) are not tied to live line conditions,
      delaying corrective actions by hours or days.
  solution:
    - >-
      Inline and nearline AI vision models detect critical defects: color shift
      (ΔE), registration drift, missing/blurred print, die-cut dimensional
      out-of-tolerance, nicks/angel hair, glue presence/placement/width, and
      barcode/Datamatrix grading.
    - >-
      Low-latency edge inference appliance with PLC/MES connectors triggers
      rejects, alarms, and automatic line slow/stop rules; cloud portal handles
      labeling, versioning, and analytics across plants/SKUs.
    - >-
      Template-driven model onboarding: teach a new SKU in <60 minutes using
      50–150 images; active learning improves performance over the first 2–4
      weeks; auto-drift detection prompts revalidation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, retrofit-friendly quality control that catches print, die-cut,
    and gluing defects in real time at production speeds, reducing scrap 20–40%
    and lifting FPY by 8–15 points—without vendor lock-in. Deploy on-prem edge
    with cloud analytics, integrate with existing cameras or low-cost upgrades,
    and achieve <6-month payback.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific defect dataset and pre-trained models for paperboard
    substrates and finishes, plus turnkey PLC/MES connectors that enable
    same-day integration and low-latency reject control—delivering measurable
    scrap reduction under real line conditions without proprietary hardware
    lock-in.
