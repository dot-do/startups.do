leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Early-phase zoning due diligence is slow and costly (4–12 staff
      hours/site) and error-prone due to complex, city-specific codes and
      overlays.
    - >-
      Architects need quick yes/no feasibility and a conservative buildable
      envelope before committing to proposals, but data is fragmented across
      PDFs, GIS layers, and municipal portals.
    - >-
      Manual interpretation risk leads to redesigns, delays, and liability
      exposure when misreading setbacks, height limits, FAR, or parking
      requirements.
    - >-
      Developers and brokers expect rapid turnarounds (same-day) for offers and
      pro formas; firms lacking an instant workflow lose bids.
    - >-
      Existing tools either provide raw zoning layers or high-level analytics
      but not a parcel-specific, auditable 3D envelope with code-cited
      derivations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Address-to-report workflow: enter an address/APN to receive setbacks,
      height/FAR, lot coverage, parking ratios, overlays, and compliance notes.
    - >-
      Auto-generated conservative 3D massing envelope with lot line controls,
      corner lots, and sloping terrain considerations where data allows.
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and code citations for each attribute (chapter,
      section, effective date), with links to municipal docs and GIS layers.
    - >-
      Scenario toggles for bonuses/overlays (e.g., IZ, TOD, height bonuses,
      affordable housing incentives) with conservative defaults turned off.
    - >-
      Design exports: SketchUp, Rhino, Revit mass, and GeoJSON; shareable web
      viewer and stamped PDF report.
    - >-
      Portfolio mode for bulk addresses (CSV/API) and batch deliverables for
      developers/brokers.
    - >-
      Change alerts when municipal codes or GIS layers update; per-city update
      logs and data freshness badges.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, code-cited zoning and buildable envelope per address—in minutes,
    not days—delivered as a conservative 3D massing, with auditable references
    and design-ready exports.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-city, code-cited zoning knowledge graph and massing engine trained
    on thousands of annotated parcels, with human-in-the-loop QA, city-specific
    precedence rules, and a feedback dataset no new entrant can easily
    replicate; plus CAD/BIM-native exports that plug directly into architects’
    workflows.

  character: >-
    Architects and design teams who want instant, reliable zoning data and a
    conservative buildable envelope from an address to kick off feasibility and
    concept design with confidence.
  problem: >-
    - External: Zoning codes and overlays are fragmented and slow to research;
    manual calculations for setbacks, height/FAR, lot coverage, and parking are
    error-prone.

    - Internal: Deadlines loom; fear of missing a constraint and looking
    unreliable to clients.

    - Philosophical: Knowing what can be built on a parcel should be fast,
    clear, and accessible from a single address.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve wrestled with 1,000-page codes, mismatched GIS layers, and
    last-minute feasibility requests.

    - Authority: The service parses municipal codes and GIS data to output
    setbacks, height/FAR limits, lot coverage, parking ratios, and a 3D massing
    envelope—documented and conservative, with sources cited.
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Enter an address or parcel ID.
      2) AI identifies zoning and overlays; calculates constraints and capacity.
      3) Receive a shareable report with setbacks, height/FAR, lot coverage, parking ratios, and a 3D massing envelope.
      4) Export data/models; optionally request human review.
    - Agreement Plan: Transparent assumptions, citations to code sections,
    conservative defaults, audit trail of inputs, and clear versioning when
    codes update.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Get an instant Zoning & Buildable Envelope Report.

    - Transitional: Download a sample report; subscribe to zoning update alerts;
    get a feasibility checklist.
  success: |-
    - Minutes to a credible feasibility baseline.
    - Sharable visuals (3D massing) that align teams and clients early.
    - Fewer surprises, redesigns, and change orders.
    - Stronger proposals and faster go/no-go decisions.
    - Traceable assumptions that build client trust.
  failure: |-
    - Missed constraints leading to redesigns and lost time.
    - Over/under-building due to manual errors.
    - Slower proposals and weaker client confidence.
    - Costly delays at permitting or entitlement.
