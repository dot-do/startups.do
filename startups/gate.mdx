  problem:
    - >-
      Duty allocators spend 30–60% of their shift resolving stand conflicts,
      swaps, and last‑minute changes across dozens of constraints (aircraft
      type/wingtip clearance, intl/domestic segregation, MCT/passenger flows,
      curfews, tow rules, stand closures).
    - >-
      Existing RMS/AODB tools detect conflicts but provide limited,
      non‑explainable optimization and require manual rework under time
      pressure.
    - >-
      IRROPS (weather, late inbounds, diversions) trigger cascading
      reassignments that are slow to evaluate manually, increasing remote stand
      use, tows, and off‑block delays.
    - >-
      Airline preferences, code‑share priorities, and SLA/PRM gates are hard to
      encode and maintain consistently, leading to disputes and lack of
      auditability.
    - >-
      Resource knock‑ons (tugs, GPUs, gates with dual boarding, bussing
      capacity) are rarely considered holistically, causing hidden costs and
      safety risks.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability erodes trust: allocators need clear justifications
      to align with apron control, airlines, and regulators.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (AODB, RMS, CDM milestones, NOTAMs, stand works, weather)
      slows decision making and increases errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization + AI copilot: deterministic constraint solver ensures
      safety/feasibility; learning layer ranks feasible options by
      multi‑objective score (delay, tows, pax connections, airline preferences,
      walking distance, resource load).
    - >-
      Real‑time conflict detection and resolution suggestions with
      human‑in‑the‑loop acceptance; every recommendation includes quantified
      impacts (minutes saved, tows avoided, MCT risk change).
    - >-
      What‑if scenario sandbox: simulate IRROPS (e.g., 45‑min inbound delay,
      stand closure) and compare plans in seconds using an A‑B scorecard.
    - >-
      Constraint knowledge base: 100+ prebuilt airport constraints; airport
      teams can edit/add rules (e.g., noise curfews, deicing pads, widebody
      wingspan limits).
    - >-
      Continuous learning from operator actions: acceptance/override feedback
      refines weights per airport, season, and time‑of‑day.
    - >-
      Transparent audit trail: every change is logged with rationale, inputs,
      and predicted vs. actual outcome for post‑ops review and regulatory
      audits.
    - >-
      Seamless integrations: adapters for major AODB/RMS/CDM systems; ingest
      schedules (OAG/Cirium), NOTAM/stand closures, weather, and resource data.
    - >-
      Safe deployment path: 6–8 week shadow mode producing recommendations
      without affecting live ops, followed by phased go‑live and 24/7 support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Resolve stand conflicts and propose optimal, explainable gate/stand
    assignments in seconds—reducing tows, remote stands, and passenger/MCT

  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable hybrid solver (hard‑constraint feasibility + learned ranking)
