  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and agronomists overspend on soil lab analyses due to inefficient,
      uniform grid sampling that ignores within-field variability.
    - >-
      Sampling plans are time-consuming (1–3 hours/field) to design and hard to
      audit; routes are inefficient, increasing labor and travel time by 25–50%.
    - >-
      Zone delineation is often subjective and inconsistent year to year,
      degrading trend analysis and variable-rate recommendations.
    - >-
      Budgets are fixed, but sample counts are not optimized for statistical
      confidence, leading to under- or over-sampling.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across yield maps, EC layers, satellite imagery, and
      soil surveys; integrating these for stratified sampling is complex.
    - >-
      Labs and retailers need standardized sample IDs and chain-of-custody;
      manual paperwork increases errors and turnaround time.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven stratified sampling: fuse yield histories, EC, soil survey,
      topography, and spectral indices to delineate stable management zones and
      place sampling points.
    - >-
      Budget-aware optimization: dynamically recommend sample counts per zone to
      meet user-defined precision (e.g., target CV or margin of error) under a
      cost ceiling.
    - >-
      Route optimization: multi-field, multi-vehicle routing that respects field
      boundaries, entry points, and terrain; exportable to mobile navigation.
    - >-
      QA/QC and auditability: uncertainty maps, coverage metrics, repeatable
      zone definitions, and versioned plans for year-over-year comparability.
    - >-
      Workflow automation: sample ID barcoding, chain-of-custody forms, LIMS
      integration, and exports (Shapefile/GeoJSON/ISOXML/Operations Center).
    - >-
      Offline-capable mobile app: turn-by-turn to sampling points, scan-and-log
      samples, photo proof, and automatic sync when online.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut soil testing costs by 20–40% while improving representativeness and
    consistency. Generate defensible, stratified grid/zone sampling plans and
    optimized routes in minutes, with auditable uncertainty metrics and
    one-click lab workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from executed plans and lab results builds a
    proprietary representativeness model per crop/region that competitors
    without routed field execution data cannot replicate; combined with deep
    LIMS and farm platform integrations that create switching costs.
