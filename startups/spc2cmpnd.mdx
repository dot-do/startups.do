leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Lengthy, expensive formulation cycles: 4–8 weeks from spec to validated
      recipe; 6–10 lab iterations per program; $5k–$20k in testing per
      formulation.
    - >-
      Knowledge trapped in experts/spreadsheets; hard to scale or transfer. New
      engineer ramp-up 6–12 months.
    - >-
      Supply volatility forces recipe rework; difficulty substituting
      resins/additives while meeting specs, cost, and regulatory constraints.
    - >-
      Slow RFQ/quote response times (2–10 days) results in lost business or
      margin give-up.
    - >-
      Inconsistent property prediction; trial-and-error process settings cause
      scrap/rework; first-pass success often <35%.
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance complexity (REACH, RoHS, UL 94, FDA, Prop 65) adds
      manual checks, late-stage failures, and documentation burden.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/LIMS/PLM/COAs; poor data quality hinders
      modeling and traceability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Generative formulation engine that proposes candidate recipes from target
      specs (mechanical/thermal/flame/color), constraints (regulatory, cost,
      density), and available inventory.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models predict properties (e.g., tensile, flexural,
      Izod/Charpy, HDT/Vicat, MFI, CTI, UL 94), with uncertainty quantification
      and sensitivity to lot variability.
    - >-
      Constraint solver enforces multi-region compliance (REACH, RoHS, PFAS
      watchlists, SVHC), customer blacklists/whitelists, and cost/CO2 targets.
    - >-
      Process-setting recommender outputs extruder temperature profile, screw
      speed, feeder rates, die temp, and cooling profile based on formulation
      rheology and equipment capability.
    - >-
      ERP/LIMS/PLM connectors ingest inventory, COAs, historical run data;
      auto-cleaning and material normalization with ontology mapping to supplier
      catalogs.
    - >-
      Rapid DOE plan generator (2–4 candidates + confirmation runs) and
      integrated lab work orders; seamless results capture to close the loop and
      retrain models.
    - >-
      Quoting assistant produces costed BOMs, predicted yield, compliance
      statements, and risk flags for customer-ready proposals.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: alternative additives/resins, price shocks, and
      regional compliance changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From spec to manufacturable, compliant polymer formulation options in hours,
    not weeks—ranked by cost, performance, and availability—complete with
    predicted properties, uncertainty bounds, and line-ready process settings,
    all tailored to your inventory and equipment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Federated, privacy-preserving learning across multiple customers yields
    superior, line-calibrated models and material equivalence maps without
    exposing proprietary recipes; combined with integrated regulatory
    intelligence and equipment-OEM process models, this creates a feedback moat
    that improves with every run.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Compounding and formulation managers at plastics processors who must turn
    customer specs and available resins into compliant, on-cost compounds—fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: Converting vague specs into workable formulations is slow and
    iterative; lab time is scarce; inventory and regulatory constraints shrink
    options; data lives in silos (ERP/LIMS/PLM). 

    - Internal: Pressure to hit spec on the first pass, protect margins, and
    avoid compliance surprises creates stress and late nights. 

    - Philosophical: Engineers shouldn’t have to guess—data they already own
    should make formulation smarter, safer, and faster.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the scramble—balancing targets, machine limits, changing
    supply, and evolving regulations while customers expect speed. 

    - Authority: Built by polymer scientists and ML engineers; grounded in
    validated material-property data; integrates with your inventory and
    compliance sources; provides explainable predictions and traceable
    recommendations.
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Connect inventory, specs, and regulatory constraints
      2) Enter targets (properties, cost, compliance, process limits)
      3) Generate ranked formulation candidates with predicted properties and process settings
      4) Select top candidates, validate in lab, and iterate
      5) Approve to production; feedback loops continuously improve accuracy
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Your data stays private; you own your formulations and IP
      - Transparent inputs, feature importance, and confidence ranges
      - Enterprise-grade security with private deployment options
      - Easy export to ERP/LIMS and audit-ready reports
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a demo; Start a pilot on one product family. 

    - Transitional: Download a sample candidate report; Try with sandbox data;
    Get an ROI worksheet.
  success: |-
    - Hit target properties with fewer iterations and faster cycle times
    - First-pass yield increases; scrap and rework decrease
    - Automated compliance screening (e.g., REACH, RoHS, FDA, UL) reduces risk
    - Optimized BOM cost and process windows protect margins
    - Faster RFQ turnaround with defensible, traceable recommendations
    - Institutionalized know-how that scales beyond individual experts
  failure: |-
    - Continued trial-and-error drives long lead times and missed deadlines
    - Over-formulated, over-cost compounds erode margins
    - Compliance gaps create recalls and reputational risk
    - Lost RFQs to faster competitors; tribal knowledge walks out the door
