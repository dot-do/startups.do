leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Agencies spend 4–12 weeks per signup doing manual run-cutting and block
      optimization inside legacy tools; small rule changes require re-runs that
      can take days.
    - >-
      Complex and evolving labor rules (CBAs) create risk of violations,
      grievances, and costly arbitration; schedulers lack automated rule
      validation across all scenarios.
    - >-
      Operator bids are labor-intensive to assemble (rosters, pick lists, relief
      points, pay codes), error-prone, and inconsistently formatted across
      divisions.
    - >-
      Existing scheduling suites (e.g., HASTUS, Trapeze, Optibus) optimize
      blocks but require expert tuning and provide limited
      explainability/fairness metrics for operators/unions.
    - >-
      Agencies lack rapid “what-if” scenario capability (service cuts, added
      trips, detours, special events) with quantified impacts on platform hours,
      overtime, spread, and operator satisfaction.
    - >-
      Procurement constraints and limited IT capacity create integration
      friction with payroll/timekeeping and downstream systems, causing
      duplicate data entry and delays.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-driven run/block optimizer tuned for transit labor rules
      (meals, reliefs, spreads, premiums, RDO patterns) with explainable
      trade-offs.
    - >-
      Automated bid packet generation: rosters, run cards, pick lists, seniority
      application, pay codes, and export to union-ready PDF/print and web pick
      portals.
    - >-
      Scenario studio: run unlimited what-ifs (service level, detours, split
      shifts, garage constraints) with KPIs (platform hrs, deadhead, relief
      count, overtime%) and confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Rule engine and validator: machine-readable CBA library; flags potential
      violations pre-bid; generates compliance reports shareable with union/HR.
    - >-
      Operator fairness analytics: dispersion of start times, weekend work, pay
      premium distribution, recovery time, and equity by garage/route.
    - >-
      Integrations: import from HASTUS/Trapeze/Optibus, GTFS and CAD/AVL; export
      to payroll/timekeeping (UKG/Kronos), HRIS, and pick portals.
    - >-
      Collaboration workflow: redline/approve flows among schedulers, ops, and
      union; version control; change logs for auditability.
    - >-
      Bid-day assist: live monitoring of pick progress; conflict detection;
      automatic roster backfills and what-if rebalancing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A domain-specific AI and optimization copilot that encodes your CBA,
    minimizes platform and overtime hours, and auto-drafts operator bid packets
    in hours instead of weeks—with full audit trails, fairness metrics, and
    native connectors to HASTUS/Trapeze/Optibus.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, machine-readable CBA library and constraint compiler
    tailored to North American bus transit, combined with a scenario engine that
    quantifies cost, fairness, and compliance in minutes—and validated by
    ex-agency schedulers and union partners. The integration footprint across
    HASTUS/Trapeze/Optibus plus bid-packet automation creates switching costs
    and defensibility.
