  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.3
  risks:
    - False negatives (esp. PSE)

    - Sufficient compute for full-res analysis
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Rising delivery complexity: Broadcasters/OTT platforms have divergent
      specs (e.g., Netflix IMF App 2E, DPP AS-11, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+,
      regional broadcasters), leading to frequent rejections and costly
      re-deliveries.
    - >-
      Manual QC is slow and expensive: Human QC averages 1–3x realtime and
      $75–$150 per program hour; rush turnarounds are even costlier.
    - >-
      False positives/negatives from rule-based QC: Legacy automated QC tools
      struggle with edge cases (e.g., mixed program/advert segments, variable
      loudness targets, background profanity) causing unnecessary manual review
      or missed defects.
    - >-
      Regulatory risk: PSE (photosensitive epilepsy) compliance, profanity, and
      loudness violations carry legal/contractual penalties and brand damage.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows: Files move across S3, Aspera, Signiant, MAM/DAM
      (Avid, Dalet, Iconik, Frame.io), and transcoders (Vantage, Elemental). QC
      doesn’t follow the asset lifecycle seamlessly.
    - >-
      Low observability: Lack of audit-ready evidence and machine-readable QC
      reports slows approvals and complicates dispute resolution with
      distributors.
    - >-
      Scale constraints: Spikes around seasonal content, sports, and ad
      campaigns exceed in-house QC capacity.
    - >-
      Globalization: Multi-language caption/audio tracks increase profanity,
      timing, and mapping errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated file-based QC pipeline supporting IMF, AS-11, MXF, ProRes, and
      common OTT mezzanines via watch folders, S3/SFTP, Aspera/Signiant, and
      REST API.
    - >-
      Policy templates for major platforms (e.g., Netflix, Prime Video, DPP
      AS-11, Hulu, Disney+, YouTube/Twitch loudness) with a low-code spec editor
      to map custom broadcaster sheets to machine rules.
    - >-
      AI-driven checks: ITU-R BS.1770-4 loudness and true-peak; silence/black;
      PSE heuristics aligned with Ofcom/DPP guidance; profanity (ASR + language
      ID + context) across 30+ languages; tech spec validation (codec, frame
      rate, bitrate, color space, HDR10/Dolby Vision metadata, audio channel
      mapping); caption/subtitle timing/overlap/profanity; letterboxing/AFD and
      pillarbox detection.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review portal: triage false positives, annotate
      timelines, one-click generate fix instructions; export EDL/markers for
      Resolve, Avid, Premiere.
    - >-
      Fix-suggestions: loudness normalization recipes, slate/leader insertion
      checks, rewrap/transcode presets for non-compliant parameters; optional
      auto-fix for loudness/true-peak with re-verify.
    - >-
      Compliance evidence: versioned, cryptographically signed JSON/PDF QC
      reports with frame/timecode references, thumbnails, and audio/loudness
      plots.
    - >-
      Scalable, cost-aware compute with GPU/CPU auto-selection; priority/rush
      queues with SLAs.
    - >-
      Webhooks and connectors to Vantage, Elemental, Dalet, Iconik, Avid
      Interplay, Frame.io, Telestream, and common delivery endpoints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native, policy-driven QC that meets broadcast/OTT specs in minutes—not
    hours—with measurable accuracy, low false positives, and audit-ready reports
    that match delivery checklists. Plug into your existing storage, MAM, and
    transcode pipelines with an API-first design.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    SpecGraph engine that converts unstructured delivery specs (PDF/Docs) into
    validated, reusable machine policies with test vectors; plus a proprietary
    dataset of real-world rejects from aggregator and broadcaster partners that
    continuously improves models and reduces false positives. Deep, native
    connectors into MAM/transcode ecosystems shorten time-to-value and create
    switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Post supervisors, delivery ops leads, and QC managers at studios, streamers,
    distributors, and post houses who must deliver zero-defect, spec-compliant
    masters on deadline.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual QC misses loudness, PSE, profanity, black/silence, peaks,
    and spec mismatches—triggering rejections and fees. Internal: Teams burn
    time on repetitive reviews and stressful re-delivery loops. Philosophical:
    Quality and compliance shouldn’t depend on all-nighters or subjective
    judgment.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand delivery-day anxiety and shifting broadcaster/OTT
    specs. Authority: Built by broadcast engineers; validates against EBU
    R128/ITU BS.1770, CALM Act, PSE heuristics, and major OTT/broadcaster tech
    specs; integrates with existing pipelines and produces audit-ready reports.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Point the service at your storage or pipeline. 2) Configure:
    Choose a network/OTT template or define thresholds (loudness, peaks,
    silence/black, PSE, profanity, tech specs). 3) Validate: Run automated QC to
    get pass/fail, timecoded findings, fix guidance, and re-check on new
    renders.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a trial or book a 20-minute demo; optionally upload one file for a
    free sample QC report.
  success: >-
    Fewer rejections and resubmits, faster deliveries, unified compliance across
    partners, hours saved per title, clear audit trail, happier clients, and
    predictable margins.
  failure: >-
    Continued rejections, missed slots and late fees, overtime burnout,
    reputational damage, and lost distribution windows.
