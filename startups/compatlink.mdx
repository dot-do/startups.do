  title: Parts Compatibility & Substitute Recommendation (OEM/PMA/NSN)
  description: >-
    Suggests approved substitutes and alternates using IPCs, SBs/ADs, NSN
    cross-refs, and prior usage.
  targetUsers:
    - Inside Sales
    - Tech Support

    - Flag regulatory constraints (FAA/EASA/AAR)
    - Present ranked alternates with evidence citations
    - Log selection to improve model
  tools:
    - PDF parsers/OCR (Textract)
    - Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/OpenSearch)
    - OpenAI/Embedding models
    - Rules engine for regulatory filters

  risks:
    - Suggesting non-compliant alternates
    - Outdated approval data
    - Hallucinated citations—must show sources
  dependencies:
    - Access to IPCs and approval databases
    - Up-to-date regulatory data feeds
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers receive high volumes of RFQs with OEM part numbers that are
      backordered or obsolete; identifying compliant substitutes (PMA/alternate
      NSN/IPC interchangeability) is manual, slow (30–180 minutes per RFQ), and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Cross-references are fragmented across IPCs, SBs/ADs, NSN databases, OEM
      portals, supplier notes, and tribal knowledge; no single source ties
      airframe applicability, effectivity, and regulatory notes to alternates.
    - >-
      Risk of non-compliant recommendations leads to NCRs/RMAs, regulator
      findings, and customer distrust; lack of traceability makes audits painful
      and slow.
    - >-
      Lost revenue from low first-call fill rate and high quote turnaround time;
      customers shift to faster competitors/marketplaces.
    - >-
      Margin erosion from recommending “safe but expensive” OEM parts, missing
      lower-cost PMA/alternate options within compliance.
    - >-
      Onboarding new sales reps/catalog analysts takes months due to complex
      interchangeability rules and AD/SB applicability.
    - >-
      Static cross-ref tools don’t reflect real-world prior usage, recent
      ADs/SBs, or inventory/margin context, resulting in poor recommendations.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered compatibility engine that maps OEM P/Ns to PMA/alternate/NSN
      equivalents with applicability constraints (platform/series/effectivity),
      supported by citations to IPCs, SBs/ADs, CMMs, STCs, and OEM bulletins.
    - >-
      A continuously updated knowledge graph linking P/N↔NSN↔CAGE↔ATA
      chapter↔applicability↔regulations, enriched by anonymized, opt-in prior
      usage evidence across customers.
    - >-
      Compliance-first recommendation workflow: each suggestion includes
      approval type (PMA/TSO/STC), conditions of use, affected ADs/SBs, and a
      confidence/risk score plus an exportable compliance pack (PDF).
    - >-
      Margin- and inventory-aware ranking: prioritize in-stock equivalents
      meeting compliance, factoring landed cost, lead time, AOG priority, and
      customer-specific constraints.
    - >-
      Seamless quoting integrations (email parsers, ERP/CRM connectors,
      marketplace plug-ins) to deliver recommendations inside the rep’s
      workflow.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence mappings; curation tools for
      catalog teams to accept, reject, or annotate alternates, feeding back into
      model training.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quote with confidence. CompatLink AI surfaces approved substitutes and
    alternates (OEM/PMA/NSN) in seconds with audit-ready traceability to IPCs,
    SBs/ADs, and prior usage—lifting fill rate and margins while reducing
    compliance risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, compliance-first knowledge graph enriched by real prior-usage
    signals from an opt-in network of distributors—creating a defensible network
    effect. Deep, certified integrations into industry ERPs/marketplaces and
    audit-ready trace packs make switching costly and alternatives less trusted.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transportation equipment and supplies (except motor vehicle) merchant
    wholesalers—procurement, AOG/line-down desks, and sales teams who must
    deliver fast, compliant parts options to win quotes and keep customers
    running.
  problem: >-
    They lose time and margin chasing compatible parts across OEM/PMA/NSN
    numbers. IPCs, SBs/ADs, and tribal knowledge are scattered, creating
    uncertainty that risks non-compliance, returns, grounded assets, and lost
    orders.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of line-down calls and compliance audits. Our AI
    is trained on IPCs, SBs/ADs, NSN cross-refs, and proven prior usage to
    deliver auditable substitute recommendations with approval basis,
    effectivity, and traceability—integrated securely with your ERP and commerce
    tools.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your catalogs, ERP, and IPC/SB/AD data; import prior usage. 2)
    Search or call the API with any part number to get OEM/PMA/NSN alternates
    with approval basis, effectivity, and confidence. 3) Apply business rules to
    quote/fulfill alternates and track acceptance and outcomes.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot using your parts
    list. Transitional: Download a sample compatibility report.
  success: >-
    Quote faster, win more lines, raise fill rates and margins, cut returns and
    audit risk, and keep fleets operational. Typical impact: faster RFQ
    turnaround, higher alternate-line utilization, improved inventory turns, and
    100% traceable recommendations.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams keep guessing across fragmented data, assets stay
    grounded longer, bids go to faster competitors, mis-ships and chargebacks
    climb, audits expose gaps, and inventory bloats with dead stock.
