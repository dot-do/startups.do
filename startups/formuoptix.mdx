  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile input costs (butterfat, MSNF, sugars, hydrocolloids) cause 3–15%
      quarterly COGS swings with slow manual reformulation cycles.
    - >-
      Complex constraints: standards of identity, nutrition targets,
      allergen/label claims, plant capabilities (HTST/UHT, overrun limits, draw
      temperature) make cost-down changes risky.
    - >-
      Siloed data (PLM/ERP, spreadsheets, LIMS, supplier specs) slows projects;
      typical reformulation cycle is 6–12 weeks and 5–10 pilot runs.
    - >-
      Sensory and texture proxies (hardness, meltdown, scoopability, ice crystal
      growth) are difficult to predict; misses cause rework and waste.
    - >-
      Ingredient shortages/substitutions (e.g., LBG variability) disrupt
      production due to lack of equivalency mapping and validated backups.
    - >-
      Lack of scenario planning for price shocks (dairy fat, dextrose, corn
      syrup solids) leads to reactive purchasing and margin erosion.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization engine minimizing cost while meeting hard
      constraints (regulatory/label, nutrition, allergens, process) and
      targeting soft KPIs (hardness, meltdown, overrun).
    - >-
      Physics- and data-informed predictors for freezing point depression,
      sweetness equivalence, mix viscosity at 4°C, fat destabilization index,
      and storage stability proxies.
    - >-
      Constraint editor with standards-of-identity by region; automated claim
      checks (e.g., light/reduced fat/sugar).
    - >-
      Ingredient equivalency library mapping stabilizer/emulsifier systems and
      sweetener blends with functional envelopes and substitution limits.
    - >-
      Scenario and sensitivity analysis: commodity price shocks, supplier
      outages, carbon intensity preferences, and MOQ impacts.
    - >-
      Workflow: import baseline formula/specs → set targets → run Pareto
      optimizer (cost vs texture/nutrition) → auto-generate lab plan → pilot
      feedback closes the loop.
    - >-
      Integrations to PLM/ERP/LIMS for specs, CoAs, costs, and QC outcomes;
      one-click export of batch sheets and label panels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    texture/process constraints—within 6–8 weeks—via an explainable AI optimizer
    connected to your PLM/ERP and supplier data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    R&D and operations leaders at ice cream and frozen dessert manufacturers who
    must hit cost, nutrition/label, and texture targets without compromising
    processability.
  problem: >-
    Balancing butterfat, MSNF, and stabilizer/emulsifier systems against label,
    nutrition, allergen, and process constraints is slow, expensive, and
    risky—leading to margin loss, inconsistent texture, and delayed launches.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to reduce COGS while protecting quality and
    claims. Our AI, built by dairy technologists and data scientists, uses
    validated process models and regulatory-aware formulations to recommend
    transparent, ready-to-run recipes.
  plan: >-
    1) Import specs: targets (cost, nutrition, texture), constraints (label,
    allergens, process), and current formulas. 2) Optimize: AI explores
    cost-down or target-led mixes (butterfat, MSNF, stabilizers/emulsifiers)
    within process limits. 3) Deliver: best-fit formula, predicted
    texture/process KPIs, nutrition panel/claims, and plant-ready settings—then
    iterate with your trial feedback.

    single-SKU optimization snapshot and sample report.
  success: >-
    3–10% lower COGS, fewer plant trials, faster reformulations, stable texture
    across seasons, compliant labels/claims, confident scale-up, and a
    defensible margin story.
  failure: >-
    Continue overspending on fat/MSNF, rely on trial-and-error, risk claim or
    label misses, suffer texture variability, delay launches, and erode margins.
