leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or ERP-native sequencing often ignores allergen changeover costs,
      causing 10–30% of line time lost to sanitation and verifications.
    - >-
      Frequent re-planning due to volatile orders and short shelf life leads to
      extra changeovers, off-schedule sanitation, and missed due dates.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to true changeover cost (by allergen class, equipment
      family, product viscosity, color/odor) results in suboptimal sequences.
    - >-
      Allergen cross-contact risk increases with ad-hoc resequencing;
      documenting rationale for auditors is time-consuming.
    - >-
      Sanitation labor is scarce; overtime and weekend cleans inflate costs and
      water/chemical consumption.
    - >-
      Generic APS tools lack built-in allergen rules and shelf-life windows for
      perishable prepared foods, forcing spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      QA and Production goals conflict (due-date vs. fewer changeovers) without
      a shared optimizer and auditable plan.
    - >-
      Inability to simulate scenarios (rush order, line downtime) hurts service
      levels and elevates recall risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest orders, forecasts, BOMs, routings, allergen attributes, line
      eligibility, current plan, and sanitation windows from ERP/MES (e.g., SAP,
      Plex, Infor) daily and intra-day.
    - >-
      Build and maintain a plant-specific changeover cost matrix (time, labor,
      sanitation type, swabs/ATP, water/chemical) by allergen transition and SKU
      attributes.
    - >-
      Optimize daily and multi-day production sequences per line using hybrid AI
      (MILP/constraint programming + ML-estimated clean times), balancing due
      dates, shelf-life windows, and sanitation constraints.
    - >-
      Auto-generate sanitation and verification plan (wet/dry clean, CIP slots,
      crew assignment, swab schedule) aligned to the production sequence.
    - >-
      Provide what-if simulation for rush orders, line outages, allergen events,
      and crew shortfalls; quantify impact on OTIF, OEE, and risk.
    - >-
      Push executable schedules to MES/dispatch lists and mobile; capture
      actuals (clean time, pass/fail swabs) to continuously improve the model.
    - >-
      Produce auditor-ready documentation: rationale for sequence, allergen
      transitions, verification logs, and digital sign-offs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut allergen changeovers and sanitation downtime 20–40% while protecting due
    dates and shelf-life constraints—boosting OEE by 5–10 points, improving OTIF
    by 2–5 points, and providing an auditable, risk-scored sequence
    purpose-built for perishable prepared foods.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built allergen and sanitation optimization engine with empirically
    learned changeover costs, coupled with an audit-grade documentation workflow
    and deep integrations to QA/LIMS—creating a data moat that improves accuracy
    and compliance over time and is hard for generic APS/ERP vendors to
    replicate.
