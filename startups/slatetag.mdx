  title: Footage Metadata Tagging and Stock Prep
  description: >-
    Auto-tag shots with objects, actions, locations, people, and generate
    searchable logs for MAM/stock sales.
  targetUsers:
    - Stock libraries
    - Documentary teams
    - MAM/archives
    - Ad agencies
  triggers:
    - Client uploads raw or proxy footage
  inputs:
    - Video files
    - Any existing logs/keywords
    - Face/brand allowlists/blocklists
  steps:
    - Scene/shot segmentation
    - 'Visual tagging (objects, actions, logos) and OCR'
    - Speaker ID/diarization and transcript extraction
    - Near-duplicate detection and best-take scoring
    - Keyword and description generation
    - Export to MAM/stock ingestion schemas
  tools:
    - OpenAI Vision/CLIP
    - Whisper/diarization
    - OpenCV
    - FAISS/perceptual hashing
    - ffmpeg
  outputs:
    - CSV/JSON/XMP sidecars
    - Contact sheets and thumbnails
    - Searchable transcript with timecodes
  pricingModel:
    - Per hour of source footage
    - 'Add-on: human metadata editor review'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4.5
    overall: 4.7
  risks:
    - Privacy/face recognition concerns
    - Logo/brand detection false positives
    - Storage egress costs
  dependencies:
    - MAM schema mapping
    - Storage access/permissions

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual logging and tagging typically consumes 2–6x runtime per hour of
      footage, costing $60–$300 per hour at typical assistant editor rates.
    - >-
      Metadata quality is inconsistent across teams and vendors; lack of
      standardized taxonomies reduces searchability and resale potential (stock
      marketplaces reject or de-rank poorly keyworded clips).
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain: creators juggle NLEs, spreadsheets, transcription
      tools, and MAMs, leading to rework and metadata loss on export/import.
    - >-
      Stock prep is tedious: shot segmentation, keywords, model/property/brand
      flags, releases, and agency-specific schemas are repetitive and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Missed revenue: archives and libraries can’t easily surface long-tail
      content; poor metadata reduces discoverability and licensing
      opportunities.
    - >-
      Compliance and brand safety risks: untagged sensitive content (logos,
      minors, personal data, profanity, violence/nudity) causes takedowns or
      legal exposure.
    - >-
      Multi-language needs: global buyers search in multiple languages; most
      catalogs lack multilingual metadata and transcripts.
    - >-
      Turnaround time: fast-moving clients (news, branded, sports, social) need
      searchable logs within hours to maximize content value.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven pipeline that auto-detects shots, objects, people (face
      recognition with consent/whitelists), actions, locations/landmarks,
      logos/brands, and compliance signals (violence, nudity, profanity).
    - >-
      Fast, accurate transcripts with speaker diarization and named-entity
      recognition to extract people, places, organizations; multilingual
      translation and cross-language search.
    - >-
      Agency-specific taxonomy mapping (e.g., Shutterstock vs. Adobe Stock
      keyword conventions), including automated keyword normalization,
      de-duplication, and long-tail suggestions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QC console to review, fix, and approve tags with
      confidence thresholds and batch operations.
    - >-
      One-click export to MAMs (Avid markers, CatDV fields, iconik metadata
      sets) and to stock marketplaces (CSV/XMP/XML presets, per-agency required
      fields, release attachments).
    - >-
      Clip packaging for stock: shot boundary detection + best subclip
      suggestions, thumbnails, contact sheets, low-res proxies, and
      title/description drafts.
    - >-
      Deployment flexibility: secure SaaS, private cloud, or on-prem GPU nodes
      for sensitive content (GDPR/CPRA aligned).
    - >-
      APIs, watch folders, and webhooks to automate ingestion, processing, and
      delivery at scale.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce footage logging time by 80% while increasing discoverability and
    stock marketplace acceptance with accurate, export-ready metadata tailored
    to each agency and MAM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-built, continuously updated mappings to major stock marketplaces and MAM
    schemas, enriched by proprietary ground-truth from real creator catalogs and
    sold clips; active-learning loops tuned for stock and post use-cases;
    human-in-the-loop QC network specialized in agency approval criteria;
    deployment flexibility (true on-prem) for sensitive archives; speed/cost
    optimizations enabling 3–6x real-time throughput at sub-$1/hour COGS at
    scale.

  character: >-
    Post supervisors, archivists, and producers in Other Motion Picture and
    Video Industries (NAICS 512199) who want footage to be instantly searchable
    and sellable.
  problem: >-
    External: Hours of unlogged or inconsistently tagged footage slow edits and
    block stock revenue. Internal: Teams waste time on tedious manual logging.
    Philosophical: Great shots shouldn’t stay invisible.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived the logging grind and know industry workflows. Our AI is tuned
    for production metadata, respects privacy, and outputs clean, consistent
    tags your team can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your storage or MAM. 2) AI auto-tags people, objects, actions,
    and locations; generates timecoded, controlled-vocabulary metadata (optional
    human QC). 3) Export to your schema for MAM ingest or stock platforms.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo or start a small pilot; download a sample metadata
    packet.
  success: >-
    Find shots in seconds, edit faster, standardize metadata, unlock stock
    revenue, reduce cataloging costs, and deliver confidently to clients and
    marketplaces.
  failure: >-
    Missed licensing revenue, blown deadlines, bloated logging budgets, lost
    clips, and libraries no one can search.
