  problem:
    - >-
      LDAR programs are resource-heavy: a typical 324199 facility has
      8,000–25,000 components in VOC service, but labor budgets support only
      periodic surveys; high-value leaks can persist between cycles.
    - >-
      Manual OGI video review is slow (1–2x real time) and subjective;
      technicians spend 10–20 hours reviewing for each full-site screening with
      inconsistent detection sensitivity.
    - >-
      Historical LDAR data is underused; most sites do not model leak recurrence
      risk by component type, service, or repair history, leading to
      non-prioritized routes and low ‘leaks found per hour’.
    - >-
      Compliance exposure: missed or late repairs and incomplete documentation
      risk NOVs and fines; scattered data across LDAR databases, spreadsheets,
      and CMMS increases audit risk.
    - >-
      Skilled labor shortages and site access restrictions (permits, hot-work,
      confined space) increase survey costs and extend time-to-repair.
    - >-
      Environmental and ESG pressure to show quantifiable VOC/methane
      reductions; current reporting lacks transparent, defensible attribution of
      reductions to proactive actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Historical LDAR risk scoring: ingest LeakDAS/LDARtools exports and CMMS
      history to predict per-component leak probability next cycle; generate
      prioritized routes and ‘watchlists’.
    - >-
      OGI video review assistant: process FLIR GF320/GF620 footage; detect/track
      plumes, highlight suspect frames, rank clips by severity/consistency, and
      link to nearby components via GIS/P&ID overlays.
    - >-
      Field optimization: route builder that balances risk score, physical
      proximity, permit constraints, and technician time; optional weather
      windows for OGI effectiveness (temperature, wind, solar loading).
    - >-
      Repair guidance and verification: recommend likely failure modes (packing,
      gasket, seal), suggest spares, and provide post-repair verification
      checklists; enable side-by-side before/after OGI comparison.
    - >-
      Compliance-grade reporting: auto-generate audit trails—who saw what, when;
      evidence packets with time-stamped frames, bounding boxes, and technician
      sign-offs; integration to existing LDAR databases.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: tunable thresholds, quick-review UI to clear or
      escalate flags, and feedback loops that retrain models on site-specific
      conditions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Find more leaks with fewer field-hours: data-driven LDAR that prioritizes
    the 10–20% of components responsible for 60–70% of leaks and flags suspect
    plumes in OGI footage within 24 hours—reducing cost per found leak by 30–50%
    and time-to-repair by 25–40%, with audit-ready evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, cross-operator OGI and LDAR dataset with regulatory-grade
    annotations; pre-built connectors to incumbent LDAR tools and CMMS;
    third-party field validations demonstrating ≥60% of leaks captured in
    top-decile targets and 4–6x OGI review throughput; and partner distribution
    through established LDAR and OGI service networks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    LDAR and Environmental/Compliance managers at NAICS 324199 facilities
    (asphalt, lube oil, wax, coke, and related products) who must hit inspection
    deadlines, cut emissions, and deploy limited crews efficiently.
  problem: >-
    External: Thousands of components and hours of OGI footage make it hard to
    spot the few leaks that matter while audits and deadlines loom. Internal:
    Crews are stretched; manual video review is slow and subjective; data sits
    in spreadsheets and CMMS silos. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to hunt
    blindly—people should focus where leak risk is highest.
  guide: >-
    We understand LDAR realities in 324199—tight windows, consent decrees, and
    field constraints. Our team blends LDAR practitioners and AI engineers;
    models learn from historical LDAR outcomes and OGI footage; workflows align
    with your tags, routes, and CMMS; and we maintain enterprise-grade data
    security and privacy.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historical LDAR data and tag registry (no new hardware). 2) We
    score components for leak likelihood and generate prioritized routes/work
    orders. 3) Optionally upload FLIR/OGI videos—AI flags suspect plumes with
    timestamps and key frames. 4) Crews validate, repair, and close out. 5)
    Dashboard tracks findings, time saved, and emissions avoided. Start with a
    2–4 week pilot; your data stays yours.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a pilot and upload a sample dataset/OGI reel. Transitional:
    Request a sample risk report and a 5‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    Crews spend time where it counts—more leaks found earlier, faster repairs,
    fewer repeat finds, lower product loss, confident audits, and a defensible,
    data-driven LDAR program for 324199 operations.
  failure: >-
    Status quo persists: crews chase low-risk components, leaks linger, OGI
    footage piles up, audit risk rises, and methane/VOC intensity stays higher
    than it should.
