  problem:
    - >-
      Manual COA processing is slow and error-prone: QA teams spend 10–20
      minutes per COA retyping data from PDFs and emails into ERP/LIMS, causing
      delays in lot release and production scheduling.
    - >-
      Inconsistent COA formats across suppliers lead to frequent mismatches to
      POs/lots and missed critical fields, increasing risk of out-of-spec
      materials entering production.
    - >-
      Spec compliance checks are manual and fragmented: moisture, protein, fat,
      ash, fiber, microbiological limits, mycotoxins, and heavy metals are
      validated against spreadsheets or static PDFs, creating audit gaps.
    - >-
      Nonconformance handling is reactive: NCRs, holds, and supplier corrective
      actions are created late, tracked via email or spreadsheets, slowing
      root-cause and supplier improvement.
    - >-
      Audit readiness is costly: assembling documentation for SQF/BRCGS/FSMA
      inspections takes days, with incomplete digital traceability and
      e-signature trails.
    - >-
      Lack of analytics: no centralized supplier scorecards for COA conformance,
      turnaround times, and defect trends; poor visibility into where quality
      risk concentrates.
  solution:
    - >-
      COA ingestion hub: dedicated email inbox, SFTP, supplier portal, and API
      to capture PDFs, images, XLS/CSV, and structured lab data.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned OCR/NLP: high-accuracy extraction of analytes and metadata
      from heterogeneous COA layouts; automatic unit normalization and limits
      detection.
    - >-
      PO/lot auto-matching: match COAs to inbound lots using supplier, PO, item,
      lot, shipment date, and barcode; reconcile partial shipments and split
      lots.
    - >-
      Spec validation engine: rule-based and ML-assisted checks against item-
      and supplier-specific specs (e.g., moisture, protein, fat, ash, fiber,
      salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, aflatoxin, heavy metals) with version
      control and effective dates.
    - >-
      Workflow and holds: auto-approve in-spec lots; auto-create NCRs, SCARs,
      and tasks for exceptions; set inventory holds/releases via ERP/WMS
      integration; e-signatures and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant audit trails.
    - >-
      Integrations: out-of-the-box connectors for NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics
      365, SAP Business One, Plex, SafetyChain, common LIMS, and major labs;
      webhook/API for custom systems.
    - >-
      Analytics and scorecards: supplier conformance KPIs, auto-approval rates,
      exception trends, turnaround times; export to BI tools.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: queue for edge cases, with model learning from
      QA feedback to continuously improve auto-approval.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II roadmap, data residency options,
      SSO/SCIM, least-privilege RBAC, immutable logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Zero-touch COA-to-release for pet food manufacturing: parse any supplier
    COA, auto-match to POs/lots, validate against dynamic specs, and create
    NCRs/tasks automatically. 90%+ auto-approval rate, 60–80% faster lot
    release, and audit-ready traceability out of the box.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Networked COA intelligence: a growing, proprietary library of supplier
    templates, spec mappings, and lab result patterns tuned to pet food
    materials, enabling higher accuracy and auto-approval rates than generic
    document AI. Combined with prebuilt ERP/LIMS integrations and audit-grade
    workflows, switching costs are high and performance improves with every
    customer and supplier onboarded.

  character: >-
    Dog and cat food manufacturers: QA/QC, procurement, and plant teams
    responsible for ingredient and finished-goods release.
  problem: >-
    Supplier COAs arrive in many formats; manual entry and matching to POs/lots
    slow receiving and invite errors. Specs are missed, nonconformance reports
    (NCRs) are late, and audits are stressful. Food safety shouldn't depend on
    copy-paste.
  guide: >-
    We understand pet food QA and regulatory demands (FSMA/AAFCO). Our AI parses
    COAs, matches to POs/lots, validates against your specs, and keeps you
    audit-ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/PO feed and upload specs; 2) Send COAs via email/API/portal;
    3) AI parses, matches, and validates; 4) Auto-create NCRs/tasks and route
    alerts; 5) Review, approve, and sync results back to ERP.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo and upload sample COAs for a free validation report;
    start a single-plant pilot in two weeks.
  success: >-
    Automatic COA ingestion, instant spec checks, faster lot release, fewer
    errors, auditable records, supplier scorecards, and confident, on-time
    production.
  failure: >-
    Remain stuck in spreadsheets with slow receiving, missed nonconformances,
    audit findings, overtime burnout, and higher recall and brand risk.

  problem:
    - COAs arrive in many formats; teams re-key data into ERP/LIMS.
    - PO/lot matching is error-prone and slows receiving.
    - Manual spec checks delay holds/releases and production.
    - Exceptions get missed; NCRs are late or incomplete.
    - Audit prep is painful—records scattered across emails and spreadsheets.
    - Supplier trends are opaque; recurring issues repeat.
    - Weekend/after-hours queues pile up and impact service levels.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest any COA (PDF, XLS, email, portal) and auto-parse fields with
      confidence.
    - 'Auto-match COAs to POs, lots, ingredients, and suppliers.'
    - >-
      Validate results against your specs and limits; flag out-of-tolerance data
      instantly.
    - 'Auto-create NCRs, holds, and corrective tasks based on configurable rules.'
    - Route for review/e-signature; release clean lots with a click.
    - 'Maintain complete, audit-ready records and decisions.'
    - >-
      Sync data to ERP/LIMS/WMS to eliminate duplicate entry and speed lot
      release.
