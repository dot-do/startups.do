  title: Quote and Costing Optimizer
  description: >-
    Builds costed quotes from BOMs, optimizes for margin/lead-time, and proposes
    material alternates when needed.
  targetUsers:
    - Sales/Estimating
    - Product Management
    - Finance
  triggers:
    - New RFQ or quote revision

      margin or lead-time
    - Simulate price tiers vs order size and capacity constraints
    - Generate customer-facing quote with lead-time and terms
    - Push quote to CRM/ERP and notify sales

  risks:
    - Incorrect cost drivers causing under-quoting

    - Approval rules for alternates
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Quoting is slow and manual: estimators reconcile BOMs, supplier emails,
      and spreadsheets; typical turnaround is 24–72 hours, causing lost bids.
    - >-
      Volatile resin and additive pricing: cost models quickly go stale, eroding
      margins or forcing re-quoting.
    - >-
      Spec complexity: matching property requirements (MFR, tensile, UL, color,
      regulatory) to viable alternates is error-prone and depends on tribal
      knowledge.
    - >-
      Siloed data: ERP/PLM/MES, supplier portals, and pricing indices are
      disconnected; lead times and MOQs aren’t visible during quoting.
    - >-
      Inconsistent margins: lack of scenario optimization and guardrails leads
      to underpriced quotes and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Regulatory and compliance risk: REACH/RoHS/UL/Halogen-free status isn’t
      automatically checked for alternates.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to capacity/throughput: quotes don’t reflect current
      production constraints, causing missed promise dates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated BOM intake: ingest spreadsheets, PDFs, or ERP exports; normalize
      materials and map to supplier SKUs using a polymer ontology.
    - >-
      Live cost model: pull commodity indices, contracted supplier pricing,
      freight, yield/scrap factors, and overhead to compute fully burdened unit
      cost.
    - >-
      Scenario optimizer: hit target margin or lead-time using price/lead-time
      trade-offs, MOQ breaks, and production constraints.
    - >-
      Alternate recommender: propose resin/additive alternates that match
      required properties and certifications; rank by cost, lead-time, and risk.
    - >-
      Compliance and risk checks: REACH/RoHS/UL/status validation and supply
      risk scoring at quote time.
    - >-
      Quote generation and approvals: customer-ready quote with TDS/CoA links,
      configured terms, and approval workflows; push back to ERP/CPQ.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: track actuals vs. quote for continuous calibration
      of cost models and recommendations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate cost-accurate, compliant quotes from BOMs in minutes, not days,
    while optimizing for margin and lead-time and automatically proposing
    property-matched material alternates.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset linking formulations, quotes, supplier
    performance, and actual costs/lead-times enables highly accurate,
    context-aware recommendations and optimization. Network effects emerge as
    anonymized benchmarks improve alternate selection and pricing guardrails
    across customers, amplified by pre-built ERP/supplier connectors and a
    curated polymer ontology.
