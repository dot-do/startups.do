  problem:
    - >-
      Manual CGI and physical prototyping are slow and expensive: typical CMF
      render packs take 1–3 weeks and $5k–$20k per SKU; physical colorway
      prototypes can cost $5k–$50k and delay decisions.
    - >-
      Teams must visualize dozens of CMF variants across multiple lighting
      environments for design reviews and marketing tests; current tools don’t
      batch-scale with color-accurate consistency.
    - >-
      Color fidelity is inconsistent across tools and monitors; lack of
      CIE-managed workflows leads to surprises in production (Delta E > 5).
    - >-
      Workflows are fragmented (CAD → UV/Materials → Render engine → Photoshop →
      Email/Drive review), creating rework, version drift, and long feedback
      cycles.
    - >-
      Marketing needs photoreal assets pre-tooling for A/B tests and retailer
      sell-in; mocked concepts often aren’t manufacturable or
      environment-accurate.
    - >-
      Security/IP concerns prevent the use of generic AI tools; teams need
      private, auditable pipelines and data residency controls.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven pipeline applies measured materials (BRDF/BSDF) to uploaded CAD
      and generates photoreal renders across predefined scenes and angles.
    - >-
      Palette exploration: algorithmically generate, apply, and compare
      manufacturable colorways with perceptual metrics (Delta E) and compliance
      checks.
    - >-
      Environment simulators (retail, daylight, studio, lifestyle) with
      calibrated HDRIs to preview true-to-life lighting and reflections.
    - >-
      Marketing test pack: ready-to-use image sets, 360 spins, and short clips;
      auto-composited into landing page and ad mockups for A/B tests.
    - >-
      Reviewer portal: side-by-side comparisons, annotation, version control,
      and quantitative color variance reports.
    - >-
      Plugins/API: connect from KeyShot/Rhino/SolidWorks/Blender to push/pull
      materials, cameras, and named views; web upload for non-plugin users.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Color-accurate, batch-scalable AI renders grounded in CAD and measured
    materials, delivering full CMF render packs in 24–48 hours at 70–90% lower
    cost than manual CGI, with enterprise-grade security and CMF-specific
    controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, color-managed pipeline grounded in measured materials and
    calibrated environments, validated against spectrophotometer data and
    audited with Delta E thresholds, enabling reliable 24–48h delivery of large
    CMF render packs at low unit cost. Combined with plugins, QC workflows, and
    security posture (SSO/VPC/SOC 2-ready), this creates a defensible
    data/process moat and enterprise trust.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Industrial design and CMF teams who need fast, believable renders across
    materials, finishes, and environments to align stakeholders and test the
    market.
  problem: >-
    External: Traditional rendering and photo shoots are slow, costly, and limit
    iteration across CMF and environments. Internal: Teams feel blocked by
    bottlenecks and inconsistent quality. Philosophical: Good products shouldn’t
    wait days to be seen in their best light.
  guide: >-
    We’re industrial designers and visualization engineers who know the pressure
    of tight CMF cycles. Our AI-trained material models, measured PBR libraries,
    and secure workflows deliver brand-accurate renders at speed.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload CAD and a CMF brief (palette, finishes, scenes). 2) We generate a
    photoreal render pack with multiple materials, lighting, and environments in
    24–48 hours. 3) Review, request tweaks, and receive final assets plus a
    concise CMF palette report.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on your current program. Transitional: Download a
    sample pack or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Faster buy-in, confident CMF decisions, lower visualization costs,
    high-performing marketing tests, and shorter time-to-market with consistent,
    photoreal assets across channels.
  failure: >-
    Keep waiting on overbooked viz teams, make CMF calls with guesswork, miss
    launch windows, overspend on photo shoots, and ship visuals that undersell
    your design.
