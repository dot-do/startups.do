leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual siding takeoffs from PDFs take 45–120 minutes per plan set,
      delaying quote turnaround and reducing win rate.
    - >-
      Human error (missed openings, wrong scale, inconsistent waste factors)
      leads to 2–8% material variance, eroding gross margin by $300–$1,200 per
      average residential job.
    - >-
      Estimator capacity is a bottleneck; owners or senior estimators spend
      non-billable time on measurement instead of selling or production
      planning.
    - >-
      Inconsistent BOMs and SKUs create purchase order errors and returns (3–6%
      restock/waste), adding days to project start times.
    - >-
      Existing generic takeoff tools require extensive manual markup and do not
      produce a ready-to-order siding BOM with manufacturer-specific components.
    - >-
      Training new estimators to acceptable accuracy takes 2–3 months; turnover
      resets process knowledge and standards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload PDFs of elevations/blueprints or images; auto-detect scale and
      elevations, or set a known dimension.
    - >-
      Computer vision segments cladding surfaces, gables, dormers,
      soffit/fascia; detects and subtracts openings; classifies surface types
      (lap/shingle/panel/board-and-batten).
    - >-
      Generates siding squares, linear feet for
      trim/J-channel/starter/fascia/soffit/corners/drip cap/flashing, plus
      fasteners and housewrap based on templates.
    - >-
      Applies contractor-defined waste factors and coverage yields by product
      line and story height; supports multi-material facades.
    - >-
      Maps quantities to branded SKU catalogs (James Hardie, LP, CertainTeed,
      vinyl brands) with color/texture options; exports CSV/XLSX/JSON and
      purchase order.
    - >-
      Provides annotated plan with dimension overlays and itemized audit trail
      to validate numbers with subs/clients/adjusters.
    - >-
      Pricing engine pulls distributor price lists or contractor price books to
      produce quoted cost and margin targets.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option for complex plans with <24h turnaround; API
      available for partners and enterprise ERPs/CRMs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, siding-specialized takeoffs from PDFs that deliver accurate
    squares, linear footage, and a ready-to-order BOM with manufacturer SKUs—cut
    quote prep from hours to minutes, standardize waste, and protect margin.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A siding-specific CV model and BOM rules engine trained on thousands of
    annotated elevations plus continuous learning from user corrections; coupled
    with live price list integrations and manufacturer-approved SKU templates
    that generic takeoff tools lack.

  character: >-
    Siding contractors and estimators who need fast, accurate takeoffs and
    material lists to bid more jobs with confidence.
  problem: >-
    - External — Manual PDF takeoffs are slow, error-prone, and inconsistent
    across estimators.

    - Internal — You’re tired of guessing waste and quantities, risking
    callbacks and margin hits.

    - Philosophical — Skilled pros shouldn’t lose bids or profit because of
    measuring drudgery.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy — We know a small takeoff error can erase profit and credibility.

    - Authority — Siding-focused AI identifies elevations, openings, and trims
    to produce transparent counts with editable overlays and audit-ready
    outputs.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload blueprint PDFs or elevation drawings.

    2) Confirm scale, set siding type/exposure/waste, and review AI-marked areas
    and openings.

    3) Export squares, trim counts, and a clean BOM to your quote or purchasing.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct — Start your first takeoff now.
    - Transitional — Book a 10‑minute walkthrough or try a sample project.
  success: |-
    - Faster, consistent bids with defensible numbers.
    - Accurate squares, trim counts, and BOMs that protect margin.
    - Standardized estimating across your team and smoother purchasing.

    - Over/under-order materials, causing delays, change orders, and profit
    leaks.

    - Waste nights on spreadsheets instead of running jobs and serving
    customers.
