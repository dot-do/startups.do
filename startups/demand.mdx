leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Long-lead components (e.g., engines, hydraulic pumps, gearboxes, castings,
      wire harnesses) frequently slip, causing line-down risk, premium freight,
      and re-sequencing of builds.
    - >-
      Forecasts are noisy and project-driven (dealer orders, rentals, government
      bids), leading to high MAPE (>30%) and chronic bias; planners over-buffer
      inventory or miss demand spikes.
    - >-
      Constrained MRP across multiple plants/ERPs is manual (Excel exports),
      slow (>1–2 days per cycle), and brittle; scenario planning for delays,
      substitutions, or capacity changes is ad-hoc and late.
    - >-
      Variant explosion (CTO/ETO) and partial commonality across models make BOM
      explosion + component demand signals imprecise; service parts demand
      further distorts signals.
    - >-
      Supplier capacity and lead-time variability are poorly modeled; planners
      lack proactive risk early-warning and get surprised by long-lead slips.
    - >-
      S&OP plans are not executable; rough-cut capacity vs. material constraints
      aren’t reconciled quickly, creating plan–schedule disconnect and excessive
      expediting costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest ERP/MES/PLM/BOM, supplier lead-times, dealer order books,
      telematics, and service parts data; unify into a planning data model
      tailored to NAICS 333120.
    - >-
      Probabilistic demand forecasting that blends project pipeline, dealer
      orders, macro/construction indices, seasonality, and install base
      telematics; explains bias and uncertainty bands.
    - >-
      Constrained MRP engine that respects supplier MoQs, yield, lead times,
      capacity, and substitution rules; outputs prioritized purchase proposals
      and build-sequence adjustments.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planner for long-lead slips, supplier outages, new model
      launches, and demand shocks; returns impact on ATP, service level,
      inventory, and cash in minutes.
    - >-
      Copilot interface in natural language for planners: ask for risks by
      model/plant/supplier, request safety stock changes, simulate expedite vs.
      reschedule, and get explainable recommendations.
    - >-
      Early-warning signals: dynamic lead-time forecasts by supplier/commodity,
      capacity choke-point alerts, and component risk scoring with suggested
      mitigations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI copilot that turns noisy, project-driven signals into accurate demand
    forecasts and generates feasible, constrained MRP/supply plans with instant
    what-if scenarios for long-lead components—so planners prevent line-downs,
    cut expedite costs, and improve service levels in weeks, not quarters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned planning engine for construction machinery that combines
    variant-aware BOM explosion, probabilistic demand from dealer/project
    signals, and a long-lead risk forecaster—plus an anonymized benchmark of
    supplier lead-time performance across customers to power earlier, more
    accurate risk detection and mitigation.

    Operations and supply chain leaders at Construction Machinery OEMs (NAICS
    333120) who must deliver reliably despite volatile demand and long-lead
    components.
  problem: >-
    Volatile orders, supplier constraints, and 30–60+ week parts lead times
    create forecast error, spreadsheet firefighting, and risky S&OP
    decisions—when planning should be fast, data-driven, and confident.

    Demand–Supply Planner Copilot: an AI planning partner built by manufacturing
    planners and data scientists for heavy equipment. Integrates with
    SAP/Oracle/Infor/MES, is secure and explainable, and knows constrained MRP
    and long-lead realities.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES/supplier data; 2) Build a constrained digital twin with
    demand forecasting; 3) Run what-if scenarios on long-lead parts, capacity,
    and suppliers; 4) Publish MRP/PO suggestions and allocations back to ERP; 5)
    Replan weekly with alerts and consensus S&OP outputs.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 4‑week pilot on a high-variance product
    family.
  success: >-
    Confident, executable build plans: higher forecast accuracy, improved
    service levels, 10–20% lower inventory, fewer expedites, better on-time
    delivery, and clear visibility to long-lead risks and tradeoffs.
  failure: >-
    Without it: stockouts and expediting, idle lines, late deliveries,
    excess/obsolete inventory, missed revenue, supplier penalties, and eroded
    customer trust.
