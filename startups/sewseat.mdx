leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Empty seats from last‑minute cancellations cause 8–15% lost class revenue
      per month and lower community engagement.
    - >-
      Manual waitlist management (calling/texting, tracking responses) consumes
      3–8 staff hours/week and is error‑prone.
    - >-
      Payment collection friction when a spot opens (no card on file, delayed
      callbacks) leads to abandoned fills and awkward policy exceptions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent or late notifications to instructors and front‑of‑house cause
      supply kit issues and poor participant experience.
    - >-
      Generic scheduling tools lack craft‑specific rules (supply kits, machine
      capacity, membership/loyalty discounts, deposit/transfer policies).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven waitlist ranking that auto‑offers newly opened seats via
      SMS/email and auto‑charges the next-in-line using stored payment tokens.
    - >-
      Policy engine for deposits, transfer windows, refund rules, and member
      discounts; aligns with each store’s class policies.
    - >-
      Multi-channel notifications (SMS/email/Slack) to staff/instructors for
      roster changes, supply kit counts, and room/machine capacity updates.
    - >-
      Integrations to POS/schedulers (Square, Lightspeed, Shopify POS,
      Squarespace/Acuity, Eventbrite) for real-time roster sync and add-on sales
      (kits, rentals).
    - >-
      Self-serve dashboard: live roster, waitlist, revenue recovered, SLA
      timers; override controls for edge cases; audit logs.
    - >-
      Analytics: fill rate, time-to-fill, cancellation patterns, no-show trends,
      and forecasted seat demand by class type/day/time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automatically refill canceled class seats in minutes, collect payment
    securely, and keep staff in sync—recovering 50–80% of cancellation revenue
    while saving 3–8 admin hours/week.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    End-to-end automation purpose-built for craft retailers: native
    POS/scheduler integrations, craft-specific policy templates, instant
    auto-charge with card-on-file, and a growing proprietary dataset of
    cancellation/attendance patterns in sewing/needlework that improves ranking
    and timing. Early marketplace listings and dealer network partnerships
    create distribution lock-in.

      retailers that host paid classes and workshops (North America/UK/ANZ).
