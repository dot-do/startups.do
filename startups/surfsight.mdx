leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Off‑spec and rework rates (1–5% typical) driven by lab delay (30–180
      minutes) between sampling and results for active matter, degree of
      ethoxylation (EO), viscosity, color, and cloud point.
    - >-
      Feedstock variability (fatty alcohol chain distribution, EO quality,
      impurities) causes batch‑to‑batch and within‑batch variability that
      operators cannot see in real time.
    - >-
      Ethoxylation and sulfation reactions are exothermic and sensitive to
      temperature, catalyst, and EO feed rate; small deviations push properties
      out of spec and create safety and quality risks.
    - >-
      Manual sampling increases cycle time, operator exposure, and lab backlog;
      late detection of drift leads to scrap or costly rework/blending.
    - >-
      Existing NIR/FTIR models drift due to probe fouling, optical aging, or
      recipe changes; maintaining chemometric models requires scarce expertise.
    - >-
      Siloed data across DCS/SCADA, historians, spectrometers, and LIMS inhibits
      fast root‑cause analysis and early trend detection.
    - >-
      Customers demand tighter CoA tolerances and delivery reliability; current
      processes struggle to hit narrow windows without over‑processing
      (energy/time waste).
    - >-
      Lack of actionable operator guidance; even when anomalies are detected,
      there is no clear, validated adjustment to setpoints or feeds.
  solution:
    - >-
      Inline soft‑sensors that fuse NIR/FTIR spectra with process tags
      (temperature, pressure, flow, EO feed, agitator speed, catalyst charge) to
      predict key properties every 1–10 seconds.
    - >-
      Early warning engine that scores off‑spec risk 0–100% using statistical
      process envelopes and predictive residuals; configurable alarms with
      deadbands and persistence rules (EEMUA 191‑aligned).
    - >-
      Advisory setpoint recommender that runs fast what‑if simulations to
      suggest temperature, EO feed, and agitation adjustments within safety and
      recipe constraints; operator‑in‑the‑loop with clear rationale and
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Model lifecycle and MLOps: recipe‑aware models, calibration transfer
      across instruments, drift detection, auto‑recalibration from LIMS data,
      versioning, and full audit trail (time‑stamped, user‑signed,
      tamper‑evident).

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, QC chemists, and process engineers at surfactant plants who
    need real‑time quality assurance without slowing production.
  problem: >-
    - External: Off‑spec risk from variable feedstocks and kinetics; NIR/FTIR
    and lab lag; drifting setpoints; complex EO/PO, sulfation, and
    neutralization steps.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting and sampling; anxiety about missing cloud
    point, active matter, or viscosity targets; low trust in signals.

    - Philosophical: Quality should be known in‑line—data should prevent waste,
    not just document it.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know batches get held waiting on lab results, only to scramble
    with late tweaks and rework; cloud point and viscosity misses hurt customer
    trust.

    - Authority: Industrial AI fusing NIR/FTIR with process tags to soft‑sense
    active matter, degree of ethoxylation, viscosity, color (APHA), and cloud
    point; drift monitoring, model governance, and integration with DCS/MES/PI.
    Proven chemometrics and MLOps practices reduce risk and enhance reliability.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect: Ingest NIR/FTIR and historian tags (flows, temperatures,
    pressures, EO feed, catalyst, agitator speed).

    2) Calibrate: Build/validate soft‑sensors against lab methods; align to site
    standards and guard against drift.

    3) Operate: Run live dashboards and alarms; predict off‑spec risk
    minutes‑to‑hours ahead; suggest setpoint tweaks (feed ratio, temperature,
    hold time) with rationale.


    Agreement plan:

    - 2–4 week pilot on a priority product family.

    - No control moves without operator approval (human‑in‑the‑loop).

    - Your data stays in your environment; security‑hardened deployment.

    - Periodic model revalidation and documented change control.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a demo and start a pilot this month.

    - Transitional: Share 3–6 months of historical data for a feasibility
    readout, ROI estimate, and sample dashboards.
  success: >-
    - Real‑time estimates of active matter, degree of ethoxylation, viscosity,
    color, and cloud point at the line.

    - Early warning of off‑spec risk with actionable setpoint suggestions.

    - Up to 30–60% reduction in off‑spec/rework, 15–25% shorter cycle time from
    fewer holds, and 20–40% fewer lab samples (pilot‑dependent).

    - More consistent quality, on‑time shipments, and lower raw material and
    energy waste.
  failure: >-
    - Continued reactive firefighting, holds, rework, and blending.

    - Persistent variance in key specs leading to complaints and price
    deductions.

    - Heavy lab workload and overtime with slow feedback loops.

    - Analyzer drift goes unnoticed; operators lose trust in signals; waste and
    emissions increase.
