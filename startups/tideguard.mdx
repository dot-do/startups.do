  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable HABs and sanitation closures cause sudden harvest shutdowns,
      lost revenue, and food safety risk.
    - >-
      Growers and wild-harvesters lack site-specific, short-term forecasts and
      only receive coarse, delayed bulletins.
    - >-
      Regulators face pressure to protect public health while minimizing
      unnecessary closures, but have limited predictive tools.
    - >-
      Buyers/distributors need supply visibility to reroute purchases before
      closures disrupt demand.
    - >-
      Existing alerts are not actionable (what to do in next 24–72 hours), nor
      integrated with farm/harvest workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse remote sensing (Sentinel-3 OLCI/VIIRS chlorophyll-a, SST, fronts),
      oceanographic models (currents, wind), in-situ sensors, and historical
      closure records to predict closure risk at the bed/area level.
    - >-
      Generate probabilistic forecasts (0–100% closure risk) at 1 km or finer
      resolution with 6-hourly updates and 3–14 day horizons.
    - >-
      Deliver multi-channel alerts (SMS, app, email, VHF-synthesized brief) with
      explainable drivers (e.g., wind-driven upwelling, toxins) and confidence
      bands.
    - >-
      Provide proactive, region-specific playbooks (e.g., adjust harvest timing,
      depuration planning, relay strategies, sampling prioritization).
    - >-
      Offer API and integrations with farm/harvest apps for scheduling, lot
      tagging, and compliance logs.
    - >-
      Regulator dashboard for evidence-backed, defensible decisions; shared
      situational awareness during events.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast closures before they happen. TideGuard delivers site-level HAB and
    sanitation closure risk forecasts 3–14 days ahead with clear probability
    scores and step-by-step recommendations, reducing unplanned shutdown losses
    by 20–40% and improving harvest utilization and safety compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, region-validated labeled dataset of closures and toxin
    measurements fused with multi-sensor environmental drivers; regulator
    collaborations enabling defensible thresholds; embedded integrations in farm
    workflows and insurer-backed incentives that are hard for generalist
    weather/ocean apps to replicate.
