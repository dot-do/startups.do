leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Nonferrous forging scrap rates often range from 5–15% due to complex,
      interacting variables across billet chemistry, heat treatment, die
      condition, lube rates, press dynamics, and operator practices.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow and inconclusive: engineers spend days merging
      historian, MES, ERP, and lab data; decisions rely on tribal knowledge, not
      quantified cause-effect.
    - >-
      Material heat-to-heat variability (e.g., aluminum, copper, titanium)
      drives yield swings, but traceability from heat to part and equipment
      state is fragmented or manual.
    - >-
      Designed experiments are rare or underpowered because DOE setup,
      statistical power analysis, and production constraints are hard to
      coordinate.
    - >-
      Unplanned die wear, induction heater drift, and press misalignment create
      chronic defects (laps, folds, underfill, surface tears) with late
      detection at inspection, not at the source.
    - >-
      Data readiness is uneven: sensors exist, but time-alignment, context
      models (die IDs, tool change events, heat numbers), and quality labels are
      missing or inconsistent, blocking AI value.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data unification and traceability: connect MES/ERP, historian/SCADA, lab
      results, and maintenance logs; create part-to-heat-to-die-to-press lineage
      with second-level time alignment.
    - >-
      Causal analytics: estimate effect sizes and confidence of candidate causes
      (e.g., billet temp, die temperature, lube rate, press speed, heat lot) on
      scrap modes using explainable ML and causal inference.
    - >-
      Experiment proposal engine: generate DOE plans with factor ranges,
      required sample size, and predicted savings; track execution and measure
      causal impact.
    - >-
      Early warning and watchlists: detect shifts in key variables, drift in
      heaters/presses, or out-of-family heats; trigger actions before scrap
      accumulates.
    - >-
      Operator- and shift-aware insights: quantify operator/shift variance while
      preserving fairness via confounder adjustment; suggest standardization or
      training.
    - >-
      Change management dashboard: link trials, SOP changes, and maintenance
      events to yield impacts with before/after control charts and PPk/CPk
      movement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap 10–30%, lift first-pass yield by 1–3 percentage points, and cut
    time-to-root-cause from weeks to hours by linking scrap to process
    parameters, material heats, and equipment states—with auto-prioritized
    causes and statistically powered experiment plans.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A forging-specific causal and DOE engine with a nonferrous-focused ontology
    and defect libraries, plus OEM/SI partnerships and anonymized cross-plant
    priors that accelerate time-to-value and produce statistically defensible
    recommendations few general-purpose platforms can match.

  character: >-
    Operations and quality leaders at nonferrous forging plants who want to lift
    yield, cut scrap, and hit delivery and margin targets without firefighting.
  problem: >-
    - External: Scrap and yield loss come from hidden interactions across heats,
    furnaces, dies, presses, and schedules—locked in siloed, noisy data.

    - Internal: Teams chase hunches, spend days on NCRs, and face pressure from
    customers and leadership.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess; your data should explain scrap
    and guide what to do next.
  guide: >-
    We understand forging variability and tight process windows. Our team blends
    metallurgical expertise with applied AI, purpose-built for nonferrous
    forging. We integrate securely with MES/ERP/SCADA/LIMS/QMS, respect your
    data ownership, and focus on practical, shop-floor actions.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect data: MES, SCADA/PLC, furnaces, lab/LIMS, maintenance, toolroom.

    2) Map CTQs, tags, and routes; align part/heat/lot genealogy.

    3) Ingest history; build causal models and baselines.

    4) Surface top scrap drivers, drifting equipment, and at-risk lots daily.

    5) Propose targeted DOEs and parameter windows to confirm fixes.

    6) Review weekly; lock in changes; track savings and capability.

    Agreement Plan: Low-risk pilot, secure integration, no PLC changes,
    measurable ROI, you own your data.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery call and launch a 6-week pilot on one
    line/cell.

    Transitional: Request a sample root-cause readout on your historical runs
    and get the readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - Scrap reduced and yield stabilized across alloys and routes.

    - Faster, evidence-based investigations replace guesswork.

    - Clear parameter windows and maintained equipment states prevent
    recurrence.

    - Proactive alerts flag at-risk heats/lots before scrap occurs.

    - On-time delivery improves; margins and capacity increase.

    - A continuous-improvement loop validates fixes and scales wins.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing scrap costs, rework, and missed shipments.
    - Chronic NCRs and customer escalations.
    - Time drained by firefighting instead of improvement.
    - Misdiagnosed fixes and wasted capex.
    - Loss of tribal knowledge as experts churn.
