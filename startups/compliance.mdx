  problem:
    - >-
      Repossession actions are delayed or overturned due to incorrect or
      incomplete notices that vary by state, locality, and loan type, creating
      regulatory and reputational risk.
    - >-
      Servicers routinely miss legal holds (bankruptcy stays, SCRA protections,
      cease-and-desist, active litigation) before taking action, exposing
      lenders to fines, damages, and forced reversals.
    - >-
      Manual notice generation and hold checks take 30–60 minutes per case and
      rely on fragmented systems, causing SLA breaches and inconsistent audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Existing repo and collections platforms offer generic templates with
      limited jurisdiction logic and no end-to-end, regulator-grade evidence
      packs.
    - >-
      Compliance teams struggle to keep templates and rulebooks current with
      frequent statutory, case-law, and regulatory updates across 50 states +
      D.C.
  solution:
    - >-
      Jurisdiction engine that determines governing law and required notice set
      (e.g., right-to-cure, NOI, pre-/post-sale, deficiency) based on borrower
      address, collateral location, contract choice-of-law, and asset type.
    - >-
      Automated legal-hold checks at two gates: before notice dispatch and
      before repossession action (bankruptcy/PACER, SCRA/DMDC, active
      litigation/court dockets, cease-and-desist flags, disputes/credit bureau
      ACDVs, payment plans).
    - >-
      Notice generation from attorney-vetted, state-specific templates with
      rule-driven clauses (language, cure periods, fee disclosures, sale method,
      redemption, deficiency, translations).
    - >-
      Omnichannel delivery orchestration (certified mail, first class, email/SMS
      when allowed with consent), with USPS IMb tracking and
      proof-of-mailing/receipt artifacts.
    - >-
      Comprehensive Compliance Pack per case: notices, timestamped decision
      logs, data sources consulted, delivery proofs, audit hash, and
      chain-of-custody.
    - >-
      Continuous rules intelligence: daily legislative/regulatory monitoring,
      attorney review, and hotfix rollout with documented change logs.
    - >-
      API-first integration with lender LOS/servicing and repo platforms; UI
      workbench for case review, overrides with attestation, and exception
      workflows.
    - >-
      Alerts and timers for statutory deadlines (cure periods, post-sale notice
      windows) with dashboards and exportable audit reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, jurisdiction-accurate notice generation and automated legal-hold
    validation that reduces compliance exceptions by 80%+, cuts case prep time
    from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes, and produces regulator-ready audit packs
