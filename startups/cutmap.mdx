  problem:
    - >-
      Manual defect marking and grading are inconsistent across shifts, leading
      to 2–6% avoidable waste and rework.
    - >-
      Small/mid-size reman and planing operations cannot justify $250k–$1M+
      capex for inline scanners; they need a retrofit, camera-agnostic solution.
    - >-
      Operators spend 15–45 minutes per 1,000 board feet chalking lines and
      re-measuring, slowing throughput and causing bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Existing cutlist optimizers don’t account for live defects; they assume
      perfect stock or rely on manual input.
    - >-
      Quality documentation is weak—few plants can quantify yield loss by defect
      type or prove grade compliance to customers.
    - >-
      Species/finish variability (SYP, SPF, DF, hardwoods; rough/planed/stained)
      breaks naive computer vision; plants need models tuned to their mix.
    - >-
      Labor turnover makes it hard to train new graders; skills vary, increasing
      variability and scrap.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or stream board images/video via mobile app or fixed cameras;
      optional low-cost edge kit for offline sites.
    - >-
      Auto-calibration using a printed fiducial and board dimensions;
      species/finish selection for model tuning.
    - >-
      Defect detection (knots, checks, splits, wane) with per-defect confidence;
      outputs annotated overlays and vector cut lines.
    - >-
      Cut-map optimizer takes your cutlist (widths/lengths/kerf/grade rules) and
      maximizes yield, honoring constraints (no knot in face, defect offsets).
    - >-
      Return machine-readable instructions (CSV/JSON) and human-friendly
      overlays for monitors/label printers; optional laser projector
      integration.
    - >-
      Closed-loop reporting: yield vs. baseline, defect distribution, operator
      compliance; alerts when process drifts.
    - >-
      On-prem/edge inference for low-latency (<200 ms/frame) and data privacy;
      cloud for training, analytics, and fleet updates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI defect detection and cut-map optimization from photos or video—knots,
    checks, splits, and wane—using cameras you already have. Improve usable
    yield by 2–6% and cut marking time by ~50% within 30 days, without
    six-figure hardware or line redesign.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Species- and surface-specific models trained on a growing, proprietary,
    multi-plant dataset; self-calibrating, camera-agnostic pipeline that works
    with commodity hardware; closed-loop optimizer tied to real cutlists and
    machine outputs, creating switching costs via integrations and historical
    yield benchmarks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations managers, sawyers, and graders in cut stock, resawing, and
    planing (NAICS 321912) who must hit specs, maximize yield, and keep lines
    moving.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual defect detection and cut planning are slow and
    inconsistent; knots, checks, splits, and wane reduce yield and cause rework.

    Internal: Pressure to hit margins and ship on time while training new staff
    creates uncertainty at the saw.

    Philosophical: Good lumber shouldn’t be wasted—every board deserves its best
    use.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand how easy it is to miss defects at speed and leave
    value on the floor.

    Authority: Our AI analyzes user-uploaded photos/video, detects knots,
    checks, splits, and wane, and returns annotated cut maps with optimal cut
    lines to maximize usable yield.
  plan: >-
    1) Capture and upload board photos/video from the shop floor.

    2) Review AI overlays and suggested cut lines; adjust if needed.

    3) Export cut lists/labels or push via API to your existing workflow, then
    cut with confidence.
  callToAction: |-
    Primary: Upload a sample batch and get cut maps in minutes.
    Transitional: Book a 15-minute demo to see it on your boards.
  success: >-
    Higher yield per board, consistent grading, fewer rejects and returns,
    faster onboarding, traceable decisions, increased throughput, better
    margins, and less waste.
  failure: >-
    Keep leaving money in the sawdust: overcuts, rework, missed ship dates,
    inconsistent quality, and shrinking margins.
