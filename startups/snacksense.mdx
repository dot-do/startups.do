leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unstructured sensory notes (free text) are underutilized; teams rely on
      hedonic/JAR stats but miss nuanced language that explains why consumers
      like or dislike a snack.
    - >-
      Turning insights into formulation changes is slow and manual; R&D must
      translate attributes like “stale oil note” or “powdery mouthfeel” into
      precise levers (salt %, roast time, oil type, moisture) across multiple
      iterations.
    - >-
      Cross-study comparability is weak; descriptors vary by panel and supplier,
      making it hard to build a coherent drivers-of-liking model across products
      and time.
    - >-
      Small sample sizes and noisy panels reduce confidence; teams need
      explainable insights that are robust to panel variation and biased
      lexicons.
    - >-
      Stakeholders need faster time-to-decision; current workflows take 3–6
      weeks from panel to direction, lengthening development cycles and
      increasing COGS from rework.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest sensory data (hedonic, JAR, CATA, TDS) and free-text notes from
      CSV/XLSX or exports from Compusense, RedJade, EyeQuestion.
    - >-
      Normalize language with a snack-specific sensory ontology that maps
      descriptors (e.g., “stale/oily,” “powdery,” “stuck in teeth”) to
      chemical/process/ingredient levers.
    - >-
      Blend NLP with preference modeling (PLS, elastic net, random forest,
      mixed-effects models) to identify drivers-of-liking with confidence
      intervals and correct for panel/session effects.
    - >-
      Convert insights to actionable tweaks: dosage, process parameters, and
      ingredient swaps, with predicted uplift in overall liking and JAR penalty
      reduction.
    - >-
      Simulate trade-offs (e.g., salt vs. perceived bitterness, crunch vs.
      moisture loss) and propose a minimal DOE for the next sprint using
      Bayesian optimization.
    - >-
      Publish auto-generated, stakeholder-ready reports and API/webhook outputs
      to LIMS/PLM, ELNs, and BI tools.
    - >-
      Track outcomes by linking post-change panels to recommendations, improving
      models and quantifying ROI over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From raw panel notes and scores to ranked drivers-of-liking and concrete
    formulation tweaks (e.g., +0.2% salt, 15 s longer roast, 10% reduction in
    oil spray), with explainable impact estimates and next-iteration
    experimental designs—cutting cycle time by 30–50% and raising top-box liking
    by 5–15% in 1–2 iterations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary snack sensory ontology linking panel language to measurable
    formulation and process levers, trained on multi-source datasets and
    reinforced with observed post-change outcomes; closed-loop optimization that
    continuously improves recommendations as clients deploy changes—difficult to
    replicate without both domain data and expert-in-the-loop processes.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

  character: >-
    Snack R&D and sensory teams who want to turn panel feedback into winning
    products faster and with less guesswork.
  problem: >-
    Manual review of messy panel notes and scores makes it hard to pinpoint
    drivers of liking and choose the right formulation tweaks—slowing
    iterations, raising costs, and risking weak launches.
  guide: >-
    We’re CPG data scientists and sensory experts with an AI trained on
    snack-specific lexicons and historical panel data—turning chaotic comments
    into clear, validated insights.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload panel notes and hedonic scores. 2) Get ranked drivers of liking
    and specific formulation levers with predicted impact. 3) Follow a guided
    trial plan and validate in the next panel. Start with a low-risk single-SKU
    pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo and start a 2-week pilot—upload one recent panel to get
    actionable recommendations.
  success: >-
    Fewer iterations, faster timelines, higher liking scores, focused trials on
    what matters (crunch, salt, oil, seasoning adhesion), reduced waste, and
    confident launches that win repeat purchase.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing from scattered comments, overspend on trials, miss key
    rejection drivers, and lose share to faster-moving competitors.

  problem:
    - 'Free‑text panel notes are messy and slow to code, delaying decisions.'
    - Scores alone don’t explain why products win or fail.
    - Translating sensory feedback into formulation levers is guesswork.
