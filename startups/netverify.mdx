  title: Netlist Extraction and Compare (Gerber vs IPC-D-356A)
  description: >-
    Extracts netlist from CAM data and compares to IPC-D-356A to catch
    opens/shorts before e-test.
  targetUsers:
    - CAM engineers
    - Quality/ET test engineering
  triggers:
    - Pre-tooling signoff
    - Suspected data integrity issue
  inputs:
    - Gerbers (copper + soldermask)
    - NC drill files
    - IPC-D-356A (if available)
    - Layer stack mapping
  steps:
    - Reconstruct connectivity graph from copper and drills
    - Normalize and align to stack map; handle soldermask tenting
    - Compare to IPC-D-356A nets; diff mismatches
    - Localize suspects and render annotated evidence
  tools:
    - pcb-tools connectivity
    - Graph algorithms (NetworkX)
    - Tracespace for visuals
  outputs:
    - Mismatch report (opens/shorts/nets added/removed)
    - Annotated images of suspect regions
    - Machine-readable diff (JSON)
  pricingModel:
    - Per comparison
    - Bundle with DFM service
  humanInLoop: false

    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Ambiguous layer mapping causing false results
    - Complex impedance splits/thermal shapes misinterpreted
    - Missing/incorrect IPC-D-356A file
  dependencies:
    - Correct stack mapping
    - Clean CAM data without polarity mistakes
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      E‑test aborts and first‑article delays caused by mismatched or incorrect
      IPC‑D‑356A files (wrong net names, missing nets, layer mis‑registration)
      that are only discovered at test time.
    - >-
      Manual, engineer‑dependent netlist extraction from Gerber/ODB++ is slow
      (15–45 minutes/job), inconsistent, and error‑prone for features like
      copper pours, teardrops, via‑in‑pad, blind/buried vias, and split planes.
    - >-
      Lack of a fast, auditable, coordinate‑level discrepancy report to
      communicate issues to customers and to close CAPA/8D actions.
    - >-
      Existing CAM tool compares often require manual setup, layer mapping, and
      tuning; performance and accuracy degrade on complex HDI builds and mixed
      data quality.
    - >-
      Unnecessary scrap/rework and fixture churn from late discovery of
      shorts/opens; avoidable WIP holds that hurt OTD and customer satisfaction.
    - >-
      Insufficient process visibility: no aggregated metrics on data‑induced
      test failures, recurring customer issues, or engineer time spent on
      netlist verification.
  solution:
    - >-
      Agent monitors job drop‑folders or PLM/ERP triggers; ingests Gerber
      RS‑274X/X2, ODB++, Excellon/NC drill, and IPC‑D‑356/356A.
    - >-
      Auto‑aligns/measures layer stack and drill to copper; infers padstacks,
      blind/buried via spans, split planes, teardrops; resolves ambiguous
      connections with an ML model trained on real fab datasets.
    - >-
      Extracts a golden netlist from image/shape data and compares it to
      supplied IPC‑D‑356A; highlights open/short/missing nets, polarity errors,
      and layer mapping issues.
    - >-
      Generates an interactive, coordinate‑level discrepancy report
      (PDF/HTML/CSV) with CAM cross‑probe links and screenshots; exports
      exception nets to CAM tools for rapid fix/validation.
    - >-
      Provides guardrails: blocks e‑test job release in MES until discrepancies
      are dispositioned; maintains audit logs for QA/CAPA.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins for Genesis 2000/InCAM/UCAMX/CAM350/Valor; optional
      on‑prem appliance for ITAR/EAR and air‑gapped sites.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, high‑accuracy ‘golden netlist’ extraction from Gerber/ODB++ with
    AI and one‑click comparison to IPC‑D‑356A, delivering a coordinate‑level
    discrepancy report in minutes. Reduce e‑test aborts 30–60%, cut CAM
    verification time 20–40 minutes/job, and improve first‑pass yield and OTD —
    with auditable artifacts for QA and customer communication.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously growing dataset of real fab jobs and discrepancy
    labels powering ML models that outperform rules‑only CAM compares on complex
    pours and HDI; deep, production‑grade integrations with major CAM/MES flows;
    and an audit‑ready workflow that converts detection into rapid, documented
    resolution. Early partnerships and compliance posture (ITAR-capable, SOC 2
    roadmap) raise switching barriers.

    CAM, process, and quality engineers at bare PCB manufacturers (NAICS 334412)
    who must ensure netlist integrity and on‑time delivery.
  problem: >-
    Gerber vs IPC‑D‑356A mismatches can hide opens/shorts until e‑test; manual
    checks are slow and error‑prone, creating deadline pressure and fear of
    costly escapes.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pace and risk of CAM. Our AI service—built by PCB
    manufacturing experts—extracts netlists from CAM data and compares them to
    IPC‑D‑356A to catch issues early with precision.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload Gerbers and drill files plus IPC‑D‑356A. 2) AI extracts/normalizes
    the CAM netlist and compares it to IPC‑D‑356A, pinpointing discrepancies by
    net, layer, and coordinates. 3) Review the actionable report, fix upstream,
    and release with confidence; optional API fits into your CAM flow.
  callToAction: Start a pilot—upload a sample job or book a 15‑minute demo today.
  success: >-
    Catch opens/shorts before e‑test, raise first‑pass yield, cut scrap and
    re‑spins, shorten CAM cycles, and deliver zero‑defect boards with a clear
    audit trail.
  failure: >-
    Without this check, hidden mismatches trigger e‑test surprises, rework,
    missed ship dates, expensive returns, and eroded customer trust.
