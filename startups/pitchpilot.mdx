  problem:
    - >-
      Personalizing media pitches to each journalist’s beat and recent work is
      labor-intensive (30–60 minutes per pitch), creating bottlenecks for
      agencies handling dozens of clients and hundreds of targets.
    - >-
      Generic blasts underperform: typical open rates ~20–30% and reply rates
      1–3% for cold pitches; clients demand higher placement volume without
      expanding headcount.
    - >-
      Maintaining compliance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and CASL across multi-region
      campaigns is complex (unsubscribes, address/identification, lawful basis,
      data retention) and risky if mishandled.
    - >-
      Follow-up sequencing is inconsistent: teams under-follow or over-follow,
      damaging relationships, deliverability, and brand reputation.
    - >-
      Tool fragmentation (media databases, spreadsheets, Gmail/Outlook, mail
      merge tools, task trackers) leads to poor attribution, duplicate outreach,
      and lack of campaign visibility.
    - >-
      Deliverability issues (warm-up, throttling, sender reputation, spam words)
      reduce inbox placement and distort performance metrics.
    - >-
      Journalist data goes stale quickly (beats change, job moves), causing
      mismatched pitches, lower trust, and wasted sends.
    - >-
      Quality control is hard at scale: off-brand tone, hallucinated references,
      and factual inaccuracies erode credibility with journalists.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated research: ingest journalist profiles, recent articles, and
      social signals; build a real-time beat graph with recency weighting.
    - >-
      Evidence-cited pitch drafts: first paragraph references 1–3 recent,
      relevant articles with links and dates; tone and style match client brand
      guides.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop editor: quick approve/edit flows, red-flag warnings for
      off-brand or risky claims; one-click brief-to-draft.
    - >-
      Compliance-aware sequencing: region-aware footers, auto-unsubscribe, send
      caps, time-zone optimization, and pause-on-reply/OOO/bounce.
    - >-
      Deliverability guardrails: warm-up guidance, daily throttling,
      spam-trigger detection, domain health dashboard, and inbox provider
      best-practices baked in.
    - >-
      A/B/n and adaptive optimization: subject line and CTA testing with
      multi-armed bandit to maximize opens and replies over time.
    - >-
      Analytics and attribution: measure open, click, reply, positive-interest,
      meeting booked, and placement; tie outcomes to clients, campaigns, and
      journalists.
    - >-
      Integrations: Gmail/Outlook, media databases (Cision/Muck Rack/Prowly),
      CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce), Slack notifications, and shared suppression
      lists.
    - >-
      Governance: global DNC/suppression lists, journalist preferences (no cold
      pitch, timing, topic), and client conflict management to prevent
      duplicates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-cited, beat-accurate pitch drafting plus compliance-aware outreach
    sequencing that doubles reply rates while keeping inbox placement
    high—purpose-built for PR agencies and their workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A living journalist preference graph enriched by real reply and placement
    outcomes—combined with a PR-specific compliance engine and fine-tuned
    models—creates a reinforcement loop competitors without agency-scale data
    cannot easily replicate.
