  problem:
    - >-
      Blanket fertilizer recommendations ignore field variability, causing
      10–30% over/under-application of N-P-K and inconsistent yields.
    - >-
      Split timing is hard to execute: farmers miss basal/tillering/panicle
      splits due to labor bottlenecks and unclear reminders, reducing N use
      efficiency (NUE).
    - >-
      Soil tests are scarce or delayed; farmers lack a way to translate soil
      data and target yields into precise, stage-wise doses.
    - >-
      Nitrogen is often overused, increasing costs and risk of lodging while
      contributing to N2O emissions; potash is frequently under-applied,
      reducing grain filling.
    - >-
      Advice sources (retailers, neighbors) are not personalized and may be
      biased by inventory/pricing, not agronomy.
    - >-
      Smartphone ownership is common, but connectivity, literacy, and language
      barriers limit access to high-quality agronomy.
    - >-
      Fertilizer price volatility makes “standard” plans uneconomic; farmers
      need plans that adapt to local prices and available brands/sacks.
    - >-
      Existing tools rarely verify plant N status in-field; without LCC or
      equivalent checks, recommendations drift from reality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Onboard field basics: location, variety duration, planting/transplant
      date, target yield, irrigation type, and recent yield history.
    - >-
      Ingest soil data: lab test (preferred) or infer from public soil
      maps/legacy tests with confidence bands; flag where P/K deficits likely.
    - >-
      Generate season-long SSNM: basal, tillering, panicle initiation (PI), and
      late split doses for N; basal/split plans for P and K based on soil and
      target yield.
    - >-
      Dynamic N via smartphone LCC: weekly prompts to capture leaf images with a
      low-cost calibration card; apply N only when LCC threshold is crossed
      (e.g., LCC < 3) with dose adjusted to crop stage.
    - >-
      Timing and logistics: reminders synced to growth stage GDDs and local
      weather; buffer windows for rain and labor availability; alternative split
      suggestions if a dose is missed.
    - >-
      Local price optimization: convert kg nutrients to bagged product doses by
      nearby retailer prices/brands; show cheapest equivalent options.
    - >-
      Record-keeping and ROI: track applied doses, yield, and costs; show per-ha
      profit impact and fertilizer savings; provide season-end report for
      buyers/lenders.
    - >-
      Low-connectivity delivery: SMS/IVR/WhatsApp bot for reminders and doses;
      full Android app with offline cache; voice prompts in local language.
    - >-
      Safety and stewardship: limits to avoid over-application, lodging risk
      warnings, and compliance reports (4R principles).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Personalized, stage-wise N-P-K split plans for rice that cut fertilizer
    costs 10–20% and lift yields 3–10%, using your soil data, target yield, and
    on-phone Leaf Color Chart checks—delivered in local language,
    offline-capable, and timed to your crop calendar.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feedback-rich dataset tying smartphone LCC readings, precise split
    timings, local prices, and harvest outcomes—collected through demo plots and
    enterprise programs—enables superior dose/timing recommendations and rapid
    localization. Combined with an offline-first, voice-enabled experience and
    last-mile retailer/mill channels, this creates defensibility that generic
    advisories and one-size-fits-all apps lack.
  customerSegments:
