leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, error-prone pump selection and quoting: 1–3 days average quote
      turnaround; manual spreadsheet tools and tribal knowledge increase cycle
      time and risk.
    - >-
      Sizing and performance curve mistakes cause rework, chargebacks, and lost
      credibility; viscosity, NPSH, altitude, and fluid-property corrections are
      inconsistently applied.
    - >-
      Inconsistent pricing and margin leakage due to complex discount matrices,
      project exceptions, and manual overrides; limited guardrails.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/PLM/CRM leads to BOM mismatches, wrong lead
      times, and as-sold vs as-built discrepancies.
    - >-
      Standards compliance (API/ANSI/ISO/ATEX/NACE) is hard to track per duty
      requirement; proposals lack consistent evidence of compliance.
    - >-
      Proposal generation is labor-intensive (curves, datasheets, options, T&Cs,
      multi-currency/language), limiting sales capacity and responsiveness.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven selector ingests duty requirements (Q/H or ΔP, viscosity, SG,
      temperature, fluid, altitude, NPSHa) and constraints (materials,
      standards), proposes best-fit models with corrected performance.
    - >-
      Automatic performance curve generation and adjustment (viscosity,
      temperature, NPSH, altitude); exports pump curve, system curve overlay,
      BEP, efficiency, power, NPSHr charts.
    - >-
      Automated BOM builder based on configuration logic (materials, seals,
      motors, drives, instrumentation) with ERP-driven availability and lead
      times.
    - >-
      AI CPQ engine with customer-specific pricing, discount rules, and margin
      guardrails; flags out-of-policy quotes and suggests price bands based on
      win/loss history.
    - >-
      Proposal composer outputs branded, multi-language, multi-currency
      documents including datasheets, curves, compliance statements,
      exceptions/deviations, and T&Cs.
    - >-
      Standards compliance assistant maps configurations to API 675/676/685,
      ANSI/HI, ISO 9906 tolerances, ATEX/IECEx, NACE MR0175; generates
      compliance matrix.
    - >-
      Integrations: CRM (Salesforce/Dynamics), ERP (SAP/Infor/Oracle), PLM/PDM
      (Teamcenter/Windchill), and CAD (auto-embed datasheets/drawings).
    - >-
      Analytics: quote cycle time, hit rate by segment, margin leakage by
      option, preferred-SKU utilization, as-sold vs as-built variance, and
      cost-to-serve.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From duty point to priced, standards-compliant proposal—with performance
    curves and BOM—in under 5 minutes. CurveQuote AI learns your catalog, rules,
    and historic quotes to auto-select, price with guardrails, and generate
    customer-ready proposals that reduce cycle time by 60–80% and improve gross
    margin by 1–3 pts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning selector+CPQ tuned on pump-specific catalogs and
    historical quote-to-order outcomes, coupled with a compliance knowledge base
    (API/ANSI/ISO/ATEX) and a pre-built integration layer to ERP/CRM/PLM. This
    yields faster time-to-value (≤12 weeks), higher selection accuracy, and
    pricing guidance not easily replicated by horizontal CPQ vendors or static
    OEM selectors.

  character: >-
    OEM and distributor sales/application engineers in NAICS 333914 who must
    size, select, price, and propose pumping equipment quickly and accurately.
  problem: >-
    External: Disconnected tools and tribal knowledge slow CPQ, causing
    mis-sized selections, curve errors, and compliance misses. Internal:
    Pressure to respond fast without risking rework or warranty claims.
    Philosophical: Engineering-grade proposals should not take days or
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pain of late-night sizing, curve overlays, and pricing
    approvals. Authority: Built by ex-application engineers and CPQ architects,
    validated on hydraulic models and your catalogs, aligned with API 610, ISO
    5199, ANSI B73.1, UL, and ATEX.
  plan: >-
    1) Enter duty and constraints (flow, head, fluid, temperature, viscosity,
    NPSHa, materials, standards). 2) AI selects optimal models, generates
    performance curves, BOM, and pricing from your catalog and rules. 3) Review
    and approve; auto-generate branded proposals and push to CRM/ERP. Agreement:
    secure, auditable rules with human-in-the-loop overrides.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo. Transitional: Download a sample proposal
    and curve pack or start a 2-week pilot with your catalog.
  success: >-
    Quotes in minutes, first-time-right selections, compliant and consistent
    proposals, higher win rates and margins, faster onboarding, and a full audit
    trail from duty point to BOM.
  failure: >-
    Slow, error-prone quoting; misapplied pumps; standards noncompliance; margin
    leakage; lost deals; costly rework and warranty exposure; damaged
    credibility.
