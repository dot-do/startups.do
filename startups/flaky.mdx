  problem:
    - >-
      Flaky tests cause unpredictable CI failures, blocking merges and eroding
      developer trust in test suites.
    - >-
      Teams spend significant time rerunning builds and triaging
      non-deterministic failures, increasing cycle time and cost.
    - >-
      Root causes are often distributed across code, environment, and test data,
      making manual diagnosis slow and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Existing CI analytics surface failures but rarely pinpoint root causes or
      propose targeted, safe fixes.
    - >-
      Quarantine practices are ad hoc, leading to forgotten tests, test debt
      growth, and quality blind spots.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest CI logs and test artifacts across pipelines, normalize to a unified
      event schema, and build historical baselines per test.
    - >-
      Classify flaky tests using statistical signals (non-deterministic
      pass/fail across environments/commits, time variance, rerun behavior) with
      precision >95%.
    - >-
      Correlate failures to code changes, dependencies, timing, and environment
      to produce ranked root-cause hypotheses (e.g., race conditions, network
      reliance, time drift, shared state).
    - >-
      Generate actionable remediations: code suggestions (diffs), config
      changes, deterministic test patterns, or scoped quarantine with
      auto-created tickets and SLAs.
    - >-
      Provide governance: dashboards, trend KPIs, quarantine timers,
      auto-un-quarantine on passing streaks, and merge gate policies.
    - >-
      Deliver developer-friendly feedback loops: PR checks, Slack alerts, Jira
      links, and weekly “flake burn-down” reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut flaky test toil by 50% in 90 days: detect flakiness from CI logs,
    isolate root causes with evidence, and auto-propose fixes or safe
    quarantines—with governance to drive tests back to green.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    yielding superior detection accuracy and higher fix acceptance rates;
    combined with deep CI/framework integrations and governance workflows that
    competitors lack.

  character: >-
    Software publishers’ engineering, QA, and DevOps leaders who want
    trustworthy CI and faster releases.
  problem: >-
    Flaky tests pollute CI with false failures, slow releases, wasted engineer
    hours, and eroded trust—intermittent failures are hard to reproduce and fix
    at scale.
  guide: >-
    We understand red‑build fatigue. Our AI, trained on large CI log datasets,
    pinpoints flaky signatures, isolates root causes, and recommends proven
    fixes—integrating with GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, CircleCI, and more.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your CI and test artifacts. 2) We detect and rank flakiness,
    cluster root causes, and propose targeted fixes or quarantines via PRs. 3)
    Track stability trends and auto‑unquarantine when tests recover.
  callToAction: Start a free flakiness audit—connect your CI in minutes.
  success: >-
    Stable, trustworthy test suites; fewer red builds and reruns; faster,
    predictable releases; reclaimed developer time; lower CI spend.
  failure: >-
    Persisting flaky noise, slower releases, costly reruns, brittle pipelines,
    and burned‑out teams.
