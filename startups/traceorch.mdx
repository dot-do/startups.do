leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Multi-jurisdiction complexity: differing message schemas, event
      taxonomies, and SLAs across EU TPD primary repositories, EU Secondary
      Repository, EAEU (Chestny ZNAK), and other markets cause integration risk
      and high maintenance costs.
    - >-
      Repository reject risk: 0.5–2.0% event rejection rates are common due to
      schema drift, key mismatches, time-window violations, and
      signing/certificate issues, exposing manufacturers to penalties and
      rework.
    - >-
      Line downtime from serial number shortages: poor forecasting of UI code
      needs and latency in code provisioning lead to stoppages and OEE losses
      (0.5–2 hours/week/line).
    - >-
      Aggregation/rework complexity: managing parent–child relationships during
      rework, returns, and repack causes data gaps and compliance failures.
    - >-
      Limited end-to-end visibility: siloed Level 2/3 line systems, WMS/ERP, and
      repository feedback hinder real-time status and root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Onboarding speed: new-market or new-line go-lives take 8–16 weeks due to
      custom development and certification.
    - >-
      Security and signing challenges: eIDAS-compliant signing, certificate
      lifecycle, and HSM management are non-trivial.
    - >-
      Audit readiness: incomplete, non-immutable logs and missing traceability
      increase audit risk and remediation cost.
  solution:
    - >-
      Pre-certified connectors to EU TPD national primary repositories and the
      EU Secondary Repository, with configurable mapping and rule packs per
      jurisdiction.
    - >-
      AI-assisted validation and anomaly detection that predicts likely
      repository rejections pre-submission, flags missing master data, and
      auto-corrects common mapping issues.
    - >-
      Smart serial number provisioning that forecasts UI demand per line/shift
      using production plans, historical consumption, and OEE, with just-in-time
      buffering and fallback pools.
    - >-
      Aggregation orchestration with robust parent–child management, rework
      workflows, and audit-proof reconciliation for repack/returns/destruction.
    - >-
      Low-latency, resilient event pipeline with offline buffering, idempotency,
      and guaranteed delivery; 99.95% service availability SLA.
    - >-
      Digital signing and key management: eIDAS-compliant signing, certificate
      lifecycle automation, HSM-backed key storage, and per-market crypto
      profiles.
    - >-
      Unified compliance cockpit: real-time dashboards of code inventory, event
      backlog, repository status, and exception queues; drill-down to
      line/batch/unit.
    - >-
      Developer-friendly APIs/SDKs and pre-built adapters for common L2/3
      (MES/line control), ERP/WMS, and vision/printing systems.
    - >-
      Simulation/sandbox: digital twin of repositories for testing new
      SKUs/markets and training operators without compliance risk.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single, AI-driven orchestration layer that reliably provisions serial
    numbers, manages aggregation, and guarantees timely, correct reporting
    across jurisdictions—reducing rejects to <0.2%, cutting
    serialization-related downtime by 30–50%, and onboarding a new line or
    market in under 4 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A regulatory rule engine and connector library pre-certified with EU TPD
    primary/secondary repositories, combined with proprietary AI models trained
    on cross-tenant, outcome-labeled telemetry to predict rejections and
    optimize code provisioning. Deep partnerships with line OEMs and
    vision/coding vendors reduce integration time, and a digital twin sandbox
    accelerates safe testing and onboarding.

  character: >-
    Tobacco manufacturers and contract packers who need reliable, multi-market
    serialization, aggregation, and repository reporting.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented line systems and evolving EU TPD/national rules make serial
    provisioning, aggregation, and uploads brittle—leading to rejects, shipment
    holds, costly rework, and audit risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand high-stakes compliance. Our AI-driven Track-and-Trace
    Serialization Orchestrator unifies serial provisioning, event aggregation,
    and connectors to primary/secondary repositories (e.g., EU TPD) with
    built-in validations, audit trails, and automated recovery.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess readiness and map repositories/ID issuers; 2) Pilot with one line
    and one market using sandbox connectors; 3) Roll out to all sites with
    monitoring, SLAs, and change-control governance.
  callToAction: Schedule a compliance readiness review or request a sandbox demo.
  success: >-
    Zero-touch serial provisioning, accurate pack→carton→case→pallet
    aggregation, near-zero rejects, real-time dashboards, audit-ready records,
    and faster releases into compliant markets.
  failure: >-
    Fines, blocked shipments, production downtime, revoked market access, and
    brand damage from non-compliant or missing reports.
