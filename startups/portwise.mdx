leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Excess anchor time and schedule uncertainty: deep-sea vessels routinely
      wait 8–36 hours at anchor due to poor berth visibility and fragmented
      communications, inflating costs and emissions.
    - >-
      Limited adoption of Just‑In‑Time (JIT) arrival: operators lack
      trustworthy, port‑validated slot forecasts, making speed optimization
      risky and underused.
    - >-
      Opaque and variable port costs: DA variances of ±10–25% vs proforma are
      common; benchmarking across ports and vendors is manual and error‑prone.
    - >-
      Email‑driven coordination with agents: 100–300 emails per call across
      pilots, towage, bunkers, husbandry; slow response loops and missed
      updates.
    - >-
      Disconnected systems: AIS, weather, port community systems (PCS), voyage
      management (e.g., Veson IMOS), and agent workflows rarely sync in real
      time.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (EU ETS, IMO CII): operators need verifiable CO2 and
      cost reductions, but lack precise attribution from port‑call decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI JIT Arrival Engine: fused AIS+weather+terminal queue models produce
      speed/ETA guidance with confidence bands and live re‑routing options.
    - >-
      Agent Co‑pilot: LLM‑powered workspace that drafts/reads agent emails,
      tracks port checklists, auto‑generates pre‑arrival documentation, and
      escalates exceptions.
    - >-
      Berth & Service Orchestrator: negotiates berth windows and service
      sequences (pilotage, tugs, bunkers, crew ops) with agents and terminals to
      lock reliable times.
    - >-
      Port Cost Intelligence: tariff library + DA benchmarking identifies
      anomalies pre‑call, predicts total DA, and flags savings levers (e.g., tug
      bundles, idle generator use).
    - >-
      Compliance & Impact: per‑call CO2 and EU ETS allowance deltas from JIT
      decisions with audit trails suitable for verification and customer
      reporting.
    - >-
      Integrations Hub: connectors to Veson IMOS/Dataloy,
      SEDNA/Outlook/Teams/Slack, PCS (where available), and data feeds (AIS,
      weather, bunker prices).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One platform that turns uncertain port calls into predictable, lower‑cost,
    lower‑carbon events by combining JIT arrival optimization with an agent
    co‑pilot that negotiates slots, synchronizes stakeholders, and eliminates DA
    surprises.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed‑loop optimization with agents and terminals (not just analytics):
    proprietary dataset linking JIT recommendations to confirmed berth windows,
    executed service plans, and final DAs, enabling outcome‑trained models and
    trust scores competitors lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Ship operators (owners/operators, pools) in container, tanker,
      bulk, vehicle carriers managing 10–500 vessels.
    - >-
      Secondary: Global and regional port agency networks seeking augmented
      service delivery and automation.
    - >-
      Influencers/Stakeholders: Port authorities/PCS, terminal operators,
      charterers, bunker managers, HSSE/compliance leads, CFO/finance teams (DA
      oversight).
  channels:
    - >-
      Account‑based sales targeting top 200 operators (10–500 vessels) with
      anchor‑time pain on Europe/US/ME/Asia trades.
    - >-
      Partnerships with global agency networks (e.g., Inchcape, GAC, S5,

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Deep-sea fleet and port operations managers who want every port call to be
    predictable, efficient, and cost-controlled.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented port info, shifting ETAs, opaque tariffs, and
    multi-agent coordination cause idle time, extra costs, and missed windows.
    Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting in email and spreadsheets, unsure if
    they are overpaying or arriving at the right time. Philosophical: Ships
    should sail, not wait at anchor; data should work for seafarers, not the
    other way around.
  guide: >-
    We understand the hurry-up-and-wait reality of port calls. Our maritime ops
    and AI team built an agent co-pilot that ingests AIS, port schedules,
    weather, and tariffs to recommend JIT arrival and optimal service bundles,
    with secure, auditable workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate AIS, noon reports, TMS/ERP, and preferred agents; set
    target lanes and KPIs. 2) Pilot: Run 4-8 weeks on selected voyages to
    produce JIT and service plans; validate outcomes. 3) Scale: Automate agent
    workflows, embed approvals, and roll out fleetwide with training and
    support. Risk-free: transparent monthly pricing and data ownership retained.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and schedule your first 20 optimized port calls.
    Transitional: Download the Port Call ROI calculator and JIT Arrival
    Playbook.
  success: >-
    Predictable berthing and faster turnarounds; fewer emails and one source of
    truth; right-sized tug/pilot/bunker orders; lower waiting time, fuel burn,
    and emissions; confident cost control with happier crews and customers.
  failure: >-
    Continued demurrage and idle time; missed berthing windows; burning fuel to
    race-then-wait; overpaying for services; scattered communication and weak
    audit trails; schedule slip, budget variance, and stressed teams.
