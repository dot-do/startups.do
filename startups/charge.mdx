  problem:
    - >-
      Material costs (scrap + master alloys) account for 70–90% of COGS;
      planners routinely over-alloy by 0.02–0.10 wt% to avoid spec misses,
      inflating cost by $10–$30 per metric ton.
    - >-
      Scrap chemistries and yields vary lot-to-lot; limited or lagging analyses
      lead to unexpected Cu/Fe/Mg/Zn/Pb excursions and expensive
      rework/downgrades (1–3% of heats).
    - >-
      Furnace and process constraints (heel chemistry, charge bucket limits,
      rotary/reverb campaign rules, flux/salt limits, burner capacity) are not
      modeled in spreadsheets, creating infeasible or unsafe charge recipes.
    - >-
      Inventory constraints and supplier availability are not embedded in
      planning, causing last-minute master alloy purchases and excess working
      capital tied in high-grade scrap.
    - >-
      Manual planning takes 30–90 minutes per heat/dayplan, is highly
      tribal-knowledge dependent, and does not scale to multi-furnace sites.
    - >-
      Compliance and customer audits (automotive/aerospace specs) require
      traceability of chemistry decisions; current tools lack lot-level
      rationale and auditable trails.
    - >-
      CO2/ESG and recycled-content targets push toward higher scrap utilization,
      but without robust optimization risk of contamination and yield loss
      rises.
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine (mixed-integer linear programming + robust,
      variance-aware constraints) generates least-cost charge blends meeting
      target chemistry ranges and furnace limits in seconds.
    - >-
      Lot-level variability modeling: Bayesian updates of scrap grade
      chemistry/yield distributions using incoming OES/assay data to guard
      against uncertainty and reduce safety over-additions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop control: consumes heel and ladle OES results and automatically
      recommends trim additions (master alloy/RSI) with predicted offset to hit
      the midpoint of spec.
    - >-
      Inventory- and availability-aware planning: optimizes across current
      stock, open POs, and supplier lead times; proposes purchase quantities by
      grade to meet the next 1–4 weeks’ production plan at minimum expected
      cost.
    - >-
      Furnace-feasible recipes: respects bucket size, charge sequence, flux/salt
      limits (rotary), burner/throughput constraints, contamination memory
      (Pb/Bi/Sn) and heel dilution limits.
    - >-
      Scenario and Monte Carlo: stress-test plans for price swings (LME,
      premiums), scrap shortfalls, and chemistry variance to quantify risk and
      choose robust plans.
    - >-
      Sustainability mode: optional co-optimization for CO2e per ton and
      recycled content, with auditable reports for customers/regulators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut $10–$30 per ton from melt cost while increasing first-pass chemistry
    compliance to >98.5% by generating furnace-feasible, inventory-aware charge
    mixes that honor alloy specs and real-world scrap variability. Closed-loop
    learning from your OES results continuously reduces over-alloying and
    rework.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A closed-loop, variance-aware optimizer purpose-built for aluminum that
    learns from each plant’s OES and furnace behavior, reducing over-alloying
    without increasing risk. Prebuilt furnace and contamination constraints
    (heel memory, Pb/Bi/Sn carryover, Mg oxidation, rotary flux limits) and an
    alloy-spec library enable rapid, auditable deployments that generic LP tools
    and spreadsheets cannot match. Speed (<10s solves) supports real-time trim
    control at the ladle, not just offline planning.
