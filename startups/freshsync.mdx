leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High write‑offs due to overproduction of short‑shelf‑life SKUs (typical
      5–15% finished goods waste) driven by volatile daily demand and manual
      planning.
    - >-
      Stockouts and late orders during promotions or weather spikes cause lost
      sales and retailer chargebacks (fill rates often <95%).
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets across demand, production, and purchasing;
      schedules ignore perishability constraints (shelf life, FEFO, allergen
      changeovers), creating firefighting and expediting.
    - >-
      Inaccurate short‑horizon forecasts at SKU/day level (WAPE often >30%) and
      poor new‑item or limited‑time offer forecasting.
    - >-
      Procurement misalignment with production: wrong pack sizes, missed
      supplier lead times/MOQs, and last‑minute expedites inflate COGS by 2–5%.
    - >-
      Siloed systems (ERP/MES/WMS/POS) make it hard to build a single,
      executable plan with capacity, labor, and yield constraints.
    - >-
      Compliance and quality needs (traceability, allergen sequencing, CCP
      checks) are not embedded in the plan, causing rework and risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Forecast SKU/day/channel demand using hierarchical time‑series models
      enriched with weather, holidays, promotions, store/DC signals, and
      customer orders; cold‑start for new SKUs via similarity and attribute
      models.
    - >-
      Optimize daily/weekly production schedules using MILP/CP that respect line
      capacities, shift calendars, changeovers, allergen/clean‑in‑place
      sequencing, yields, batching, and shelf‑life targets.
    - >-
      Auto‑generate time‑phased purchase requisitions for ingredients/packaging
      with supplier lead times, MOQs, pack sizes, safety stocks, and price
      breaks; flag expedite risks and substitutions.
    - >-
      Freshness‑maximizing planning: align production date to required code life
      by customer and route; recommend FEFO allocations and cross‑dock vs.
      make‑to‑order choices.
    - >-
      Exception‑driven workflow: planners get alerts for demand spikes, supply
      shortfalls, capacity bottlenecks, and quality holds with one‑click plan
      revisions and audit trails.
    - >-
      What‑if and scenario planning: simulate promotion uplifts, weather
      impacts, labor shortages, or supplier delays; compare KPIs and choose best
      plan.
    - >-
      Tight integrations: bi‑directional APIs/EDI with ERP/MES/WMS for BOMs,
      routings, inventory, open orders, vendors; push POs/PRs and publish frozen
      schedules to shop floor.
    - >-
      Governance and trust: human‑in‑the‑loop approvals, versioning, explainable
      forecasts, and role‑based access; FSMA/allergen compliance checks embedded
      in schedules.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut waste 15–30%, raise fill rates to 97–99%, and shrink planning time
    60–80% by unifying SKU‑level demand forecasting with an expiry‑aware,
    capacity‑constrained production and purchasing plan that executes directly
    in your ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose‑built, expiry‑aware optimization stack plus a growing anonymized
    dataset of SKU/day/perishability and operational outcomes across plants;
    pre‑built ERP/Food connectors shorten time‑to‑value to <6 weeks and enable
    guaranteed ROI pilots. Domain templates (allergen matrices, code‑life by
    customer, FEFO rules) and explainable forecasts reduce change‑management
    risk vs. generic APS/MRP tools.
