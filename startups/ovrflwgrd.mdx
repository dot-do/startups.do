leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Wet-weather inflow and infiltration drive sudden surcharges and sanitary
      sewer overflows (SSOs/CSOs) with little actionable lead time, forcing
      reactive operations and overtime callouts.
    - >-
      Existing alarms and hydraulic models are threshold- or design-focused, not
      operationally predictive; operators manually reconcile SCADA trends with
      weather forecasts, losing crucial hours.
    - >-
      Utilities face regulatory penalties (often $10k–$100k per event) and
      consent decree mandates to reduce SSOs but lack cost-effective, real-time
      tools to prioritize field deployment.
    - >-
      Data quality is inconsistent (sensor drift, missing rainfall gauges),
      degrading trust and resulting in false alarms or missed events.
    - >-
      Staffing and crew routing are not aligned with spatially variable risk;
      resources are dispatched late or to the wrong basin.
    - >-
      Budget and procurement cycles favor proven, low-risk solutions with
      measurable ROI; many AI offerings are black-box and hard to justify.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion of live SCADA (flows, levels, pump runtimes), radar nowcasts
      (0–6h), and ensemble NWP forecasts (6–24h) to estimate basin-specific I&I
      responses and overflow probabilities.
    - >-
      Hybrid physics-informed ML: machine learning models constrained by sewer
      hydraulics and basin wetness memory to improve generalization on sparse
      sensor networks.
    - >-
      Risk scoring at asset and basin level (0–100) with predicted lead time,
      overflow probability, and expected volume band, updated every 5 minutes.
    - >-
      Actionable playbooks: asset-specific recommendations (pre-stage bypass
      pump at MH-123, throttle Station A by 10%, clear debris at inlet B) with
      crew routing and time-to-failure estimates.
    - >-
      Automated alerting and collaboration: SMS, push, and email alerts with
      acknowledgment tracking and shift handoff notes; integrates with CMMS for
      work order auto-creation.
    - >-
      Quality assurance layer that detects sensor drift/outages and substitutes
      with virtual sensors to sustain forecast reliability.
    - >-
      Post-event analytics: attribution of avoided volume, response time, and
      recommended capital hot-spot list to inform CIP and regulatory reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable 6–24 hour early warnings that fuse radar nowcasts, NWP ensembles,
    and live SCADA to predict basin-level surcharge and overflow risk, with
    crew-ready recommendations that cut SSOs and overtime while strengthening
    compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-utility dataset of basin I&I response signatures and transfer-learned
    models that achieve high accuracy even with sparse sensors; pre-certified
    integrations with major SCADA/CMMS vendors; and operator-tested playbooks
    that translate forecasts into concrete, auditable actions for compliance and
    ROI.

  character: >-
    Utility operations leaders and plant supervisors at sewage treatment
    facilities who need to anticipate wet‑weather I&I surges and overflow risk.
  problem: >-
    External: Rain‑driven I&I spikes overload basins, cause
    surcharges/overflows, and threaten permit compliance. Internal: Teams are
    forced to firefight with late, noisy alarms and guesswork. Philosophical:
    Communities deserve clean waterways and reliable service—even in storms.
  guide: >-
    We understand wet‑weather pain and the high stakes of SSOs and consent
    decrees. Our AI early‑warning service fuses forecast/radar rainfall,
    sensors/SCADA, and system models to predict I&I impacts and overflow risk
    6–24 hours ahead, with clear, prioritized actions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect read‑only rainfall, level/flow, SCADA, and GIS basin data. 2)
    Calibrate with recent storm history and system behavior. 3) Run rolling
    6–24h forecasts; receive risk‑ranked alerts plus recommended staffing and
    field moves. 4) Review outcomes post‑event to continuously improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo. Transitional: Request a free storm‑season
    risk snapshot from last year.
  success: >-
    Proactively staff and deploy crews before storms; fewer SSOs/surcharges and
    stronger permit compliance; lower overtime/hauling costs and protected
    assets; improved public trust and worker safety.
  failure: >-
    Unplanned overflows and basement backups; regulatory fines and consent
    decrees; burned‑out crews and wasted O&M budget; damage to pumps, lines, and
    reputation.
