  problem:
    - >-
      Galleries and dealers hold years of legacy data in spreadsheets, PDFs,
      emails, and outdated systems; records are inconsistent, incomplete, and
      hard to search.
    - >-
      Staff spend 10–20 minutes per artwork normalizing titles, mediums,
      dimensions, dates, artist names, provenance, and exhibition history;
      errors propagate to wall labels, price lists, and online viewing rooms.
    - >-
      No easy way to ensure records conform to accepted standards (e.g., CCO,
      Getty AAT/ULAN/TGN, Dublin Core, LIDO); authority control and
      deduplication are manual.
    - >-
      COAs and wall labels are generated ad hoc, often with typos, nonstandard
      dimensions/mediums, or missing attribution, causing reputational risk and
      rework.
    - >-
      Syncing clean data to gallery software (Artlogic, ArtBase, Artsystem,
      GalleryManager) is fragile; fields don’t map cleanly, and updates are
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Poor metadata reduces online discoverability, impairs fair prep, slows
      sales, and hinders insurance, shipping, and secondary market activities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Connect to gallery systems, spreadsheets, PDFs, and email; OCR and
      parse catalog docs and invoices.
    - >-
      Normalize: AI models standardize titles, mediums, dimensions, dates, and
      names; map to CCO fields; convert units; format dimensions and techniques
      per house style.
    - >-
      Authority control: Link artists to ULAN/ISNI/Wikidata, locations to
      TGN/Geo, materials/techniques to AAT; flag ambiguities for review with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Deduplicate: Identify near-duplicate works and artist variants; merge with
      transparent audit trails.
    - >-
      Enrich: Suggest missing fields (e.g., series, edition,
      signature/inscription notes), exhibition history parsing, provenance
      chains with date normalization.
    - >-
      Generate: One-click wall labels (multi-language) and COA templates with QR
      and digital signature; customizable templates aligned to brand guidelines.
    - >-
      Sync: Bi-directional, field-level mapping to
      Artlogic/ArtBase/Artsystems/GalleryManager; dry-run validations and
      rollback; webhook-based updates.
    - >-
      Assurance: Human-in-the-loop registrar review queue; change logs;
      standards validation reports; export to CSV/JSON/LIDO/Dublin Core.
    - >-
      Governance: Role-based permissions, redaction of sensitive fields (prices,
      consignor data), and read-only views for fair staff.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy art records into clean, standards-compliant, searchable listings
    in minutes—not days. Auto-generate wall labels and COAs, map to authority
    vocabularies, and sync reliably to your gallery system with measurable
    quality gains (90%+ authority match rate, 70–90% time saved per record).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized art-domain normalization engine trained on proprietary,
    expertly-labeled datasets, combined with deep integrations into leading
    gallery systems and a human-in-the-loop registrar network. This yields
    measurably higher authority match rates, lower error rates, and faster
    time-to-value than generic LLMs, DIY tools, or gallery software alone.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Commercial galleries (1–50 staff) managing 1,000–100,000 records; primary
      initial target: contemporary and modern galleries with frequent shows.
    - >-
      Mid-size dealer networks and project spaces preparing multiple exhibitions
      and fairs annually.
    - Private dealers/advisors with catalog backlogs across multiple systems.

      Referral program: Incentivize consultants/registrars and art handlers to
      refer clients (10–15% first-year commission).
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Art dealers, registrars, and gallery managers who need accurate,
    standards-based catalog records without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External—fragmented, inconsistent metadata leads to label errors, COA
    headaches, and provenance/compliance risk. Internal—constant deadline stress
    and doubt about data accuracy. Philosophical—art data should be as rigorous
    and elegant as the art itself.
  guide: >-
    We act as your registrar’s digital assistant. We get the pressure of fair
    installs and consignor demands. Built on museum standards (CCO, CDWA Lite,
    VRA Core, Dublin Core; Getty AAT/ULAN), proven with galleries, integrated
    with Artlogic, GalleryManager, Salesforce, and custom systems, with
    human-in-the-loop QA.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect and import: link your gallery system or drop spreadsheets and
    assets. 2) Normalize and generate: AI cleans to standards; outputs records,
    wall labels, and COA templates. 3) Review and sync: you approve and we push
    updates back to your systems.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct—Schedule a 20-minute demo. Transitional—Download sample outputs and
    start a no-risk pilot for 50 works.
  success: >-
    A single source of truth: clean, consistent, standards-based records; labels
    and COAs ready in minutes; synced systems; fewer errors, faster installs,
    confident provenance, and more time for clients and artists.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing messy data, duplicate records, label mistakes, COA disputes, missed
    deadlines, and eroding trust with collectors and partners.
