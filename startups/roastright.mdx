leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, promo-driven demand causes frequent stockouts on top SKUs and
      slow-moving inventory on long tails; current weekly MAPE at SKU/channel
      often >25%.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheets/ERP heuristics can’t create feasible weekly schedules
      under finite capacity; planners spend 10–20 hours/week resolving overloads
      and gaps.
    - >-
      Allergen cross-contact risk (peanut vs. tree nut families) forces
      expensive cleanouts; lack of allergen-aware sequencing inflates changeover
      hours by 20–40%.
    - >-
      Roasters/grinders are true bottlenecks (throughput in lb/hr,
      warmup/cooldown, roast curves). Changeovers, sanitation, and crew
      constraints aren’t modeled together, leading to low asset utilization and
      overtime.
    - >-
      Promotions and seasonal spikes (Q4 gifting, back-to-school, sporting
      events) aren’t modeled at SKU/channel granularity; lift and
      cannibalization are misestimated.
    - >-
      S&OP lacks a single, trusted 18-month forecast tied to a feasible capacity
      plan, resulting in misaligned procurement and excess nut/packaging
      inventory.
    - >-
      Shelf-life and FEFO rules aren’t enforced in planning, risking write-offs
      and customer chargebacks.
    - >-
      ERP APS modules are generic; food-specific constraints (oil separation
      rest time for PB, allergen matrices, rework handling) are absent or
      require costly customization.
  solution:
    - >-
      18-month rolling SKU x channel forecasts (weekly buckets first 26 weeks,
      monthly thereafter) using hierarchical, causal models with promo/event
      lift and retailer calendar alignment.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity weekly scheduling using optimization (MIP/CP): respects
      roaster/grinder rates, warmup/cooldown, labor/crews, packaging, allergen
      family matrices, sanitation, rest times, and changeovers.
    - >-
      Allergen-aware sequence optimization: groups runs by allergen family and
      flavor to minimize full cleanouts while meeting due dates and FEFO.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate promo uplifts, new SKUs, capacity changes,
      overtime vs. temp labor, and supplier constraints; compare service level,
      cost, and utilization trade-offs.
    - >-
      Automated safety stock and inventory policies aligned to service targets
      by ABC class; FEFO enforcement and near-expiry alerts.
    - >-
      S&OP workflow: a monthly consensus forecast tied to a feasible 13-week
      operations plan and a constrained procurement plan for nuts, oils,
      jars/lids/film.
    - >-
      Shop-floor feedback loop: schedule dispatch, progress capture, and near
      real-time rescheduling on disruptions (machine downtime, labor call-offs).
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box integrations to common food ERPs (Aptean/JustFood/Deacom,
      Microsoft D365/Business Central, SAP B1, NetSuite, SYSPRO) and distributor
      EDI (UNFI, KeHE).
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 6–8 weeks to go-live. Data cut: 24 months
      order/ship history, BOMs/routings, rates, changeover matrix, allergen map,
      calendars. KPI baseline and post-go-live validation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Allergen-aware demand forecasting and finite-capacity production planning
    tailored to roasted nuts and peanut butter—cut stockouts and changeovers
    simultaneously. Achieve 10–20% inventory reduction at 96–98% case fill,
    20–40% fewer allergen cleanover hours, and >90% schedule adherence within 8
    weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep, preconfigured allergen-aware planning templates and changeover
    matrices specific to nuts and peanut butter, coupled with proprietary
    sequencing heuristics and a growing anonymized benchmark dataset that
    improves recommendations across customers—delivering faster time-to-value
    (≤8 weeks) than generic APS/S&OP suites.

    peanut butter manufacturers who need reliable forecasts and allergen-safe,
    finite-capacity production plans.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile demand, retailer promos, constrained roaster/grinder
    capacity, labor limits, and allergen changeovers drive cost and chaos.

    Internal: Spreadsheets and basic MRP can’t keep up, leading to firefighting,
    overtime, and missed service levels.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess—or risk cross-contact—to deliver
    every order on time.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the realities of roasting, grinding, and allergen
    segregation—and the cost of getting it wrong.

    improved forecast accuracy and smoother schedules; secure (SOC 2-ready),
    with industry references.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect: Integrate ERP/OMS data (sales, BOMs/routings, allergens, labor,
    roaster/grinder capacities).

    2) Model: Generate 18-month SKU/channel forecasts and a weekly,
    allergen-aware finite schedule in 2 weeks.

    3) Operate: Review scenarios, finalize rules, go live with weekly refresh
    and ongoing tuning.
