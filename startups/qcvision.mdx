  problem:
    - >-
      Manual defect triage is slow (5–15 minutes/incident) and inconsistent
      across shifts, causing delayed dispositions and line stoppages.
    - >-
      Scrap and rework from late or missed defect detection typically cost 1–3%
      of COGS for mills; for a 2M sq yd/month plant, this is $300k–$900k/year.
    - >-
      Generic vision systems are costly to tune for carpet-specific defects
      (tuft pull, dye bleed, skew/bow, delamination), leading to high false
      positives and poor operator trust.
    - >-
      Smartphone photos used today are unstructured and not tied to MES/QMS
      records, limiting traceability and root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Existing inspection cameras lack actionable localization data for
      dispositions (e.g., exact location/size to cut, rework, or quarantine),
      slowing decisions.
    - >-
      Operational variability (pile height, colorways, patterns, lighting,
      motion blur) makes models drift without active learning and retraining
      processes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Smartphone and tablet capture app that standardizes photos (distance/angle
      prompts, lighting guidance), auto-uploads, and tags by order, roll, and
      operator.
    - >-
      Edge AI gateway for line cameras (GigE/USB) performing on-prem inference
      (<150 ms/frame) with cloud-managed model updates; works offline with
      store-and-forward.
    - >-
      Defect classification/localization for tuft pull, dye bleed, skew/bow,
      delamination (phase 1), with extendable classes (e.g., shading, pattern
      mismatch) via active learning.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: fast triage UI with disposition templates
      (rework, cut out, quarantine) and feedback loops to improve models.
    - >-
      Integrations: REST/OPC UA connectors to MES/QMS/SCADA (e.g., Ignition,
      Siemens Opcenter) to attach images and dispositions to lots and rolls.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: first-pass yield, defect rates by line/style/shift,
      cost-of-poor-quality (COPQ), model precision/recall drift, and ROI
      tracker.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Carpet-specific AI that classifies and localizes defects from smartphone
    photos or line cameras in under 2 seconds, cutting disposition time by 70%,
    reducing scrap 10–25%, and boosting first-pass yield—without replacing
    existing cameras or MES.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, carpet-specific defect dataset with closed-loop
    feedback from multiple mills, combined with edge-optimized models and
    pre-built MES/QMS integrations that deliver measurable ROI within 90
    days—hard for generic vision vendors to replicate.
