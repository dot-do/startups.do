  problem:
    - >-
      Fresh meat demand is highly volatile by day/SKU/store; manual ordering
      drives 3–6% shrink and frequent stockouts, especially around promos,
      weekends, and holidays.
    - >-
      Most systems don’t model primal-to-cut yields, shelf lives, and case-ready
      vs. in-store cutting, so POs and cutting plans are disconnected from real
      demand.
    - >-
      Meat managers spend 60–120 minutes daily per department placing orders and
      planning cuts with limited visibility into target service levels.
    - >-
      Lead times and supplier fill vary, creating either over-ordering (waste)
      or under-ordering (lost sales).
    - >-
      Existing forecasting tools are configured for center store; they
      underperform on perishables due to limited use of weather, local events,
      promo cannibalization, and dynamic shelf-life constraints.
    - >-
      Corporate teams lack SKU-level attribution of shrink drivers (forecast
      error vs. execution vs. promo planning) and can’t reliably quantify ROI of
      changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily store-SKU forecasts leveraging POS, on-hand, promo calendars,
      weather, holidays, and local events to target 15–20% WMAPE for fresh meat.
    - >-
      Auto-Order Agent that drafts EDI/portal-ready POs to suppliers by cutoff,
      optimizing for service-level targets (e.g., 97–98%) and waste minimization
      under lead-time and shelf-life constraints.
    - >-
      Cutting Plan Optimizer translating forecasted SKU demand into primal
      orders and cut schedules using yield libraries, labor calendars, and
      case-ready availability.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest actuals (sales, markdowns, waste, returns)
      and user overrides to retrain models weekly and tune store-specific
      parameters.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow: managers review only flagged orders (e.g.,
      supplier shortage, unexpected weather spike, promo conflicts).
    - >-
      Executive dashboard quantifying shrink reduction, service-level lift, and
      GMROI improvements at SKU/department/banner levels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict daily meat demand by SKU and auto-generate purchase orders and
    cutting plans that raise on-shelf availability to 97–99% while reducing
    shrink 15–30% and cutting ordering time by 70%—with payback in 8–12 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A meat-specific, closed-loop system that uniquely links SKU/day forecasts to
    primal-aware ordering and labor-ready cutting plans—powered by a proprietary
    yield library and override/waste feedback that continuously tunes
    store-level models. Deep integrations with scale/label systems and supplier
    EDI make execution fast and sticky, raising switching costs.

  problem: >-
    - External: Perishable demand swings with promos, weather, holidays, and
    yields—manual ordering causes stockouts or shrink.

    - Internal: Managers are tired of firefighting and second‑guessing orders.

    - Philosophical: Keeping meat fresh and available shouldn’t require heroics;
    data should do the heavy lifting.
