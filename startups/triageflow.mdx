  problem:
    - >-
      Knowledge-work teams drown in high-volume inboxes (support@, info@,
      sales@); median response times exceed SLAs, leading to lost leads and
      customer churn.
    - >-
      Emails are misrouted or stalled due to unclear ownership; managers lack
      visibility into bottlenecks and SLA risk.
    - >-
      Replies are inconsistent in tone, accuracy, and compliance; staff
      copy-paste from outdated templates, increasing error and legal risk.
    - >-
      Leads and priorities are missed because signal (urgent/new revenue) is
      buried in noise (FYI/notifications).
    - >-
      Manual triage and drafting consume 1–3 hours per agent per day, driving
      burnout and labor cost without improving quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Email classification into intent categories (e.g., billing, scheduling,
      support, sales, FYI) with confidence scores and customizable taxonomy.
    - >-
      Priority scoring and SLA timers (P0–P3) using business rules (keywords,
      sender domain, account tier), with proactive alerts in Slack/Teams.
    - >-
      Auto-drafted replies from centrally managed templates with dynamic fields
      (CRM/ticket data), tone control, and approved knowledge sources.
    - >-
      Routing and assignment to owners/queues based on rules (skills, account
      owner, workload), with fallback rules and reassign workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: approve, quick-edit, or request re-draft;
      low-risk intents can be auto-send with thresholds and audit trail.
    - >-
      Analytics: response-time reductions, draft acceptance rate, misrouting
      reductions, SLA compliance, workload distribution, and ROI dashboard.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: least-privilege email API access, PII redaction in
      prompts/logs, full audit logs, data residency options, SSO/SCIM.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box integrations: Gmail/Outlook, Slack/Teams for notifications,
      Salesforce/HubSpot, Zendesk/Freshdesk, calendars, webhooks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut your average email response time by 50–70% and missed-SLA risk by 80%
    with AI that classifies, prioritizes, drafts compliant replies, and routes
    to the right owner—fully auditable, human-in-the-loop, and integrated with
    Google Workspace/Microsoft 365, CRM, and ticketing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Per-tenant learning with strict data isolation and template governance that
    yields higher draft acceptance and lower risk than generic copilots;
    verticalized cold-start packs reduce time-to-value to under 30 minutes;
    early SOC 2 Type II compliance and marketplace certifications streamline
    procurement; partner-first motion with MSPs/BPOs embeds TriageFlow as part
    of managed services.
