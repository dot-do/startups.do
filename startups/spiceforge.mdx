  problem:
    - >-
      Ideation-to-brief cycles are slow (typical 4–6 weeks) due to manual trend
      mining, culinary prototyping, and internal approvals.
    - >-
      Preliminary costings are often off by ±10–20% because ingredient prices
      are volatile (pepper, garlic, vanilla, oleoresins) and spreadsheets lack
      current supplier data.
    - >-
      Formulators struggle to hit multiple constraints simultaneously (target
      cost, sodium, heat level, allergen-free, organic, clean label), creating
      rework and long iteration loops.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (US FDA 21 CFR 101 labeling, top-9 allergens, Prop 65,
      FEMA GRAS, ASTA methods) are checked late, causing change orders, delays,
      or costly relabeling ($25k–$75k per SKU).
    - >-
      Knowledge is siloed across R&D, procurement, regulatory, and sales; specs,
      brief templates, and cost assumptions live in disparate systems (PLM, ERP,
      spreadsheets, email).
    - >-
      Small/mid manufacturers lack in-house consumer/trend analytics; they miss
      retailer briefs and seasonal windows.
    - >-
      Scale-up from bench to pilot causes yield/loss surprises (grind/powder
      density, moisture, oil loading), impacting COGS and margin.
    - >-
      Procurement substitution decisions are reactive; alternative
      suppliers/grades are not evaluated early, limiting resilience and
      negotiating power.
  solution:
    - >-
      Trend-to-concept engine: ingest briefs plus live trend signals to generate
      8–20 on-brief concept routes tagged by cuisine, heat level, dietary, and
      claims.
    - >-
      Formulation wizard: draft preliminary spice blend formulas (by weight %)
      with processing notes and batch scaling; hit target cost/sodium/capsaicin
      levels via optimization.
    - >-
      Real-time costing: BOM pricing from supplier feeds and commodity indices
      with yield, scrap, and overhead assumptions; margin scenarios by pack size
      and run rate.
    - >-
      Compliance and claims rules: instant checks for top-9 allergens, USDA
      organic/NOP, kosher/halal flags, natural vs artificial flavoring, Prop 65
      substances, and US/CA label element prompts.
    - >-
      Supplier substitution and risk: auto-suggest alternates by functionality,
      sensory profile, and cost/lead time; highlight single-source risk.
    - >-
      Spec and commercialization outputs: export preliminary spec sheets,
      nutrition panels (est.), allergen/ingredient statements, and sales-ready
      concept decks.
    - >-
      Workflow and integration: API/connectors to common PLM/ERP and quality
      systems; role-based review and approval trails.
    - >-
      Learning loop: capture bench test feedback, wins/losses, and cost
      variances to tune models to each customer’s palate and plant.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI-native assistant that turns retailer or customer briefs into
    trend-backed concept routes and costed, compliance-checked preliminary spice
    and extract formulations in minutes—not weeks—while optimizing for target
    cost, constraints, and supply resilience.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned AI stack combining formulation optimization, real supplier
    pricing, and embedded regulatory rules—continuously improved by
    bench-validated feedback loops—plus supplier partnerships that provide
    cost/supply visibility competitors and generic AI tools lack.

  character: >-
    R&D, product, and sourcing teams at spice & extract manufacturers (NAICS
    311942) who need trend‑right concepts that hit cost and compliance.
  problem: >-
    They must fill pipelines and respond to private‑label/RFP briefs quickly,
    but lack real‑time trend insight, costed preliminary formulas, and automated
    label/regulatory checks—leading to slow cycles, rework, blown COGS, and
    compliance risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to deliver winning flavors fast without
    surprises. Our AI assistant blends market trend mining, flavor taxonomy, a
    costed formulation engine tied to your price lists, and built‑in FDA/CFR,
    allergen, claims, and Prop 65 checks.
  plan: >-
    1) Share brief, targets, and constraints (cuisine, claims, allergens, target
    COGS). 2) Receive concept board and preliminary spice‑blend formulas with
    yield, ingredient line, and cost breakdown plus compliance flags. 3)
    Iterate, lock, and export specs to ERP/LIMS or hand off for benching.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 2‑week pilot with your ingredient catalog
    and rules.
  success: >-
    Faster concept‑to‑sample cycles, confident cost targets, fewer
    reformulations, compliant labels, better RFP hit rate, and aligned
    R&D–sales–procurement.
  failure: >-
    Missed trends, stalled pipelines, over‑budget formulas, label rejections,
    lost bids, and audit exposure.
