  problem:
    - >-
      High variability at SKU-location level due to climate-driven seasonality,
      contractor project schedules, and promo spikes causes frequent stockouts
      and overstock.
    - >-
      Legacy ERP forecasting (e.g., simple moving average in P21/Infor/NetSuite)
      lacks external signals and multi-echelon logic, resulting in 30–40% MAPE
      and 5–10% stockout lines.
    - >-
      Planners spend 10–20 hours/week manually adjusting forecasts and building
      POs/transfers in spreadsheets; overrides are rarely measured or learned
      from.
    - >-
      Line transitions (new tint bases, reformulations, color discontinuations)
      and assortment changes drive cannibalization and obsolescence not captured
      by static models.
    - >-
      Supplier variability (lead times, MOQs, case-pack constraints) is not
      modeled jointly with demand, creating bloated safety stock and poor cash
      conversion.
    - >-
      Branch/DC imbalance (excess in one branch, outs in another) persists due
      to lack of automated transfer recommendations.
    - >-
      Executives lack clear KPIs tying inventory to service and working capital;
      decisions are made without measurable causal impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-location forecasting using hierarchical models (SKU↔family↔brand,
      location↔region↔climate zone) capturing climate seasonality, promotions,
      holidays, and pro/contractor project signals.
    - >-
      Signal ingestion: local weather forecasts and climate normals,
      construction permits, project bid data, and contractor purchasing patterns
      to anticipate peaks (e.g., exterior season, floor coatings after permits).
    - >-
      Multi-echelon replenishment optimization that respects supplier lead
      times, MOQs, case-pack, truckload, and DC→branch constraints; generates PO
      and stock transfer recommendations.
    - >-
      Assortment intelligence: new item forecasting via attribute-based analogs;
      cannibalization and line transitions detection to prevent overbuy and
      obsolescence.
    - >-
      Closed-loop planning: weekly consensus workflow with role-based approvals,
      explainability per SKU-location, and automatic learning from planner
      overrides.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: simulate lead-time shifts, promos, price changes, and
      supply constraints; quantify impact on service level, inventory, and gross
      margin dollars.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box ERP connectors (Epicor P21, Infor, NetSuite, D365) and
      flat-file/SFTP options; deployment in 4–8 weeks with measurable KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI demand planning purpose-built for paint and coatings wholesalers that
    fuses climate seasonality and contractor project signals to produce
    ready-to-execute PO and transfer suggestions—cutting stockouts 30–50% and
    inventory 10–20% within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary contractor signal graph and climate-seasonality feature store
    purpose-built for coatings, combined with pre-trained SKU-location models
    and an adoption engine that proves impact at the planner’s workflow
    (explainable, ready-to-execute PO/transfer lines). Fast time-to-value plus
    domain-specific heuristics for line transitions and tint/cannibalization
    create a defensible moat.
