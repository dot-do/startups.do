leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of incubator/hatcher fans, dampers, and pumps cause
      temperature/humidity deviations that reduce hatchability by 0.5–3.0% per
      affected batch and risk large chick losses.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely reactive; lack of early warning leads to
      after-hours callouts, emergency parts shipments, and overtime labor.
    - >-
      Limited planned maintenance windows (between sets) make scheduling
      difficult without reliable failure forecasts.
    - >-
      Existing OEM monitoring focuses on alarms/remote monitoring, not
      predictive failure detection or parts planning.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLC/SCADA, data historians, alarms, and CMMS; no
      unified view linking machine health to hatch performance.
    - >-
      Biosecurity constraints discourage frequent manual inspection; managers
      want fewer site entries, more remote diagnostics.
    - >-
      Inventory is either overstocked (tying up cash) or understocked (causing
      extended downtime) due to poor parts failure visibility.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-enabled sensor kit and PLC connectors capture vibration, current,
      temperature, humidity, differential pressure, and valve/damper positions
      from setters/hatchers.
    - >-
      Cloud/edge ML models predict remaining useful life (RUL) for fans, pumps,
      and dampers and estimate hatchability risk from environmental variance.
    - >-
      Automated work orders with lead times (e.g., 14 days) flow into CMMS;
      includes parts picking lists and skill/time estimates.
    - >-
      Spare parts forecasting recommends minimum/maximum levels, factoring lead
      times, failure likelihood, and scheduled sets.
    - >-
      Role-based alerts to supervisors and on-call techs (SMS/app), with
      red/amber/green health scores by cabinet/room.
    - >-
      Dashboards tying machine health to hatch performance KPIs; root-cause
      analytics for repeated events and energy deviations.
    - >-
      Biosecurity-aware remote diagnostics: fewer site entries, secure read-only
      historian integration, and vendor-access windows by approval.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven early warning of critical incubator/hatcher component failures
    (7–30 days in advance) that reduces unplanned downtime by 40%+, stabilizes
    temperature/humidity profiles, improves hatchability by 0.5–1.5%, and
    converts maintenance into scheduled, lower-cost work—without disrupting
    biosecurity or existing workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A poultry-hatchery-specific failure dataset and physics-informed models that
    link component health directly to hatchability outcomes, combined with OEM
    integrations and biosecurity-aware edge architecture. This creates earlier,
    more accurate warnings and actionable work orders than generic IoT tools or
    OEM alarms alone.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Hatchery operations manager who wants reliable incubators and hatchers with
    consistent hatch rates.
  problem: >-
    Unplanned failures of fans, dampers, and pumps stop sets and threaten chick
    welfare. Reactive maintenance drives overtime, rush parts, energy waste, and
    missed delivery windows.
  guide: >-
    We understand every missed hatch window costs birds and revenue. Our poultry
    hatchery-specific predictive maintenance AI monitors incubators and hatchers
    to forecast component failures early so you can plan work instead of
    firefighting.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect to your PLC/SCADA and sensors; baseline equipment health. 2)
    Receive failure-risk alerts with lead times and recommended actions for
    fans, dampers, and pumps. 3) Schedule maintenance and parts before
    breakdowns; prove ROI with a 60-day pilot.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute assessment or start a 60-day pilot in one setter room.
  success: >-
    Fewer unplanned stoppages; protected hatch rates; on-time chick deliveries;
    lower energy and overtime; longer asset life; confident maintenance
    schedules; calmer crews.
  failure: >-
    Recurring surprise breakdowns; lost sets and chicks; missed customer
    commitments; expensive emergency repairs; higher energy use; audit and
    welfare risks; damaged brand trust.
