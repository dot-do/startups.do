  problem:
    - >-
      Manual lost-and-found handling consumes 8–15 minutes of staff time per
      case (phone calls, texts, manual fee collection), costing $6–$15 in labor
      each incident.
    - >-
      Drivers lose 20–40 minutes per return (coordination and travel),
      disrupting earnings and acceptance rates.
    - >-
      Inconsistent fee collection and cash handoffs lead to low recovery rates,
      driver complaints, and chargebacks/fraud risk.
    - >-
      Fragmented channels (phone, email, in‑app messaging) and language barriers
      result in delayed or failed reunions and poor rider CSAT.
    - >-
      No standardized proof-of-return or chain-of-custody causes disputes with
      riders, drivers, insurers, and regulators.
    - >-
      Regulatory and privacy risks (handling PII, call recording, payments) are
      hard for fleets/TNCs to manage in-house.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: operators can’t measure true case volume, resolution
      time, cost per case, or driver impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel intake: AI agent via phone/IVR, SMS/WhatsApp, web form, and
      in-app SDK to capture item details, trip info, and consent in under 60
      seconds.
    - >-
      Smart triage: Match items to trips using caller ID, ride receipts, driver
      geos, and NLP on item descriptions; confidence scoring with human review
      queue for edge cases.
    - >-
      Automated driver coordination: Time-boxed, anonymized messaging/calls;
      one-tap accept/decline; batched return windows to minimize deadhead miles.
    - >-
      Return logistics: Offer meet-up, pickup at depot, shipping with pre-paid
      labels, or locker drop—selected dynamically based on driver/rider location
      and SLA.
    - >-
      Payments & fees: Secure fee collection (card/Apple Pay/Google Pay),
      escrow, automatic driver payouts, and configurable fee rules by
      city/fleet.
    - >-
      Identity verification & chain of custody: Rider verification, QR/barcode
      tagging, photo proof, signatures; immutable audit trail and exportable
      reports.
    - >-
      Rules & compliance engine: Per-city fee caps, disclosure, consent, call
      recording rules; PII redaction and retention policies; SOC 2/PCI-aligned
      architecture.
    - >-
      Analytics & ops console: Real-time dashboards for case volume, SLA
      adherence, CSAT, driver acceptance, and cost per case; alerts and
      root-cause analysis.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    ReturnFlow AI reunites riders with lost items 2x faster while cutting
    operator handle time by 70% and automating fee collection, with compliant,
    multilingual workflows embedded in your dispatch and driver tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    City-by-city fee and compliance rules engine plus regulator-approved
