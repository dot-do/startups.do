  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent and seasonal demand across long-tail SKUs drives high
      forecast error (>35% WAPE at SKU level) and reactive buying.
    - >-
      Static MIN/MAX and reorder points in ERP are rarely recalibrated, leading
      to 5–10% stockout rates and 20–30% excess inventory on slow movers.
    - >-
      Vendor constraints (variable lead times, MOQs, case packs, price breaks)
      create either over-buying or expensive expedites (2–5% margin erosion).
    - >-
      Multi-warehouse complexity (2–10 DCs) causes imbalanced inventory and
      avoidable transfers; planners spend 15–30 hours/week in spreadsheets
      reconciling ERP, EDI, and vendor emails.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true lead-time variability and seasonality; no
      closed-loop learning from planner overrides so processes don’t improve
      over time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Prebuilt ERP connectors ingest item masters, sales history,
      on-hand/on-order, vendor terms, and lead-time data; auto data quality
      checks flag gaps and anomalies.
    - >-
      Hierarchical, intermittent-demand forecasting (Croston/TSB, hierarchical
      Prophet/ETS, gradient boosting) with seasonality, product lifecycle, and
      new-item analogs.
    - >-
      Dynamic safety stock and reorder point optimization by SKU/location to hit
      target service levels (e.g., 98% class A, 95% B, 90% C) while minimizing
      working capital.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware PO drafting that consolidates across SKUs to respect
      MOQs, case packs, price breaks, and vendor calendars; optional budget caps
      and container fill goals.
    - >-
      Lead-time learning from historical receipts and ASN/booking data to model
      variability and auto-adjust reorder parameters as supplier reliability
      changes.
    - >-
      Approval workflow and simulations: planners review POs with explainable
      drivers (demand, safety stock, MOQ) and run what-if scenarios (service
      level, budget, deferral).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: system learns from planner edits and realized
      receipts (Forecast Value Add tracking) and improves recommendations
      weekly.
    - >-
      Multi-warehouse balancing: transfer suggestions to right-size inventory
      before buying; exception management for overstocks and at-risk stockouts.
    - >-
      One-click EDI/portal submission or ERP PO creation; audit logs and KPIs by
      vendor, category, and planner.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut stockouts by up to 30% and reduce inventory 10–20% within 90 days by
    auto-generating SKU/location forecasts, dynamic reorder points, and draft
    POs that respect lead times, MOQs, case packs, and seasonality—fully
    integrated with your ERP and EDI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A distribution-specific forecasting and reorder engine tuned for
    intermittent demand, plus prebuilt ERP/EDI connectors that enable 6-week
    pilots; a growing, anonymized benchmark of vendor lead times and service
    levels that improves recommendations; and a closed-loop system that learns
    from planner edits (human-in-the-loop) to increase PO automation over time.
