  problem:
    - >-
      Incident detection and rider alerting for bus transit is largely manual;
      average detection-to-notification delays of 10–30 minutes cause customer
      frustration and operational inefficiency.
    - >-
      Detours are crafted ad hoc, often ignoring bus-specific constraints
      (turning radius, low clearances, weight limits), leading to safety risks
      and operator confusion.
    - >-
      Rider communications are inconsistent across channels (app, SMS, web,
      signage, social), not accessible in multiple languages, and frequently
      miss affected riders; ADA/508 compliance is difficult to maintain under
      pressure.
    - >-
      Dispatchers and OCC staff are overloaded; there is no centralized triage
      with explainable recommendations, resulting in knowledge loss and variable
      quality by shift.
    - >-
      Existing systems (CAD/AVL, GTFS-rt, signage, customer comms) are siloed,
      so alerts don’t propagate reliably or quickly; GTFS-rt ServiceAlerts are
      underutilized or stale.
    - >-
      Limited post-incident analytics and after-action reviews hinder continuous
      improvement and ROI justification to leadership.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ingestion of CAD/AVL, GTFS-rt, APC, traffic, 911/public safety,
      construction, and weather feeds; ML-based anomaly detection to flag
      incidents and slowdowns.
    - >-
      Detour drafting engine optimized for buses (turn radii, height/weight
      restrictions, bus-only lanes, layover points); ripple impact analysis
      across routes, trips, and blocks.
    - >-
      Delay estimation and dynamic ETAs at route/trip/stop level; automatic
      GTFS-rt TripUpdates and ServiceAlerts publishing.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop UI: generates plain-language rider and operator messages
      with confidence scores; staff can edit/approve in one click.
    - >-
      Multi-channel publishing: GTFS-rt, agency app push, SMS, email, web
      banners, station/stop signage, headsigns, IVR scripts, and social;
      multilingual and WCAG 2.1 AA/Section 508 accessible.
    - >-
      Operator guidance: turn-by-turn detour instructions to MDT/radios,
      block/relief change suggestions, and crew notification templates.
    - >-
      Audit trail, after-action analytics, and dashboards for SLA compliance,
      incident taxonomy, and ROI reporting; secure APIs for partner
      integrations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect, decide, and deliver: AI that auto-detects disruptions, drafts safe
    detours and delay estimates, and publishes multi-channel, ADA-compliant
    alerts in under 2 minutes—reducing dispatcher workload, improving on-time
    performance, and restoring rider trust.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-agency disruption dataset and bus-specific detour engine
    deliver higher-precision recommendations than generic alerting tools;
    pre-certified integrations and cooperative procurement listings reduce
    deployment from months to weeks, creating switching costs and speed-to-value
    difficult to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transit operations leaders and dispatchers at bus and shuttle agencies who
    must keep service safe, on time, and riders informed.
  problem: >-
    External: incidents, road closures, operator shortages, and weather disrupt
    routes. Internal: staff juggle radio, CAD/AVL, and social feeds under
    pressure. Philosophical: riders deserve fast, accurate, consistent
    information—not rumors and stale alerts.
  guide: >-
    We understand the control-center pressure. Our AI monitors live ops and
    traffic signals, detects disruptions, drafts detours and delay estimates,
    and publishes clear, consistent communications to rider and operator
    channels—so your team stays in control with less chaos.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your data and channels (CAD/AVL, GTFS-rt, 511/traffic, apps, SMS,
    signage). 2) Set playbooks, thresholds, and approval rules. 3) Go live: AI
    drafts; humans approve or auto-publish; measure results and refine.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 30-day pilot on a priority
    corridor. Transitional: Get the disruption playbook and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Triage in seconds, not minutes. Detours drafted consistently. Alerts out in
    under two minutes across apps, SMS, web, and operator comms. Fewer inbound
    complaints and radio chatter, safer operations, protected on-time
    performance, and restored rider trust.
  failure: >-
    Without it, alerts lag, detours are ad hoc, operators and riders receive
    conflicting information, overtime and complaints rise, media scrutiny grows,
    and ridership erodes.
