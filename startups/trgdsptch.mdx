  problem:
    - >-
      High volume of fragmented maintenance requests (phone, email, portal, SMS)
      leads to long response and dispatch times (often 2–8 hours during
      business, 8–24 hours after-hours).
    - >-
      Incomplete requests force back-and-forth with residents; 25–40% arrive
      missing key info (access, photos, shutoff status, warranty/lease
      coverage).
    - >-
      Coordinators spend 8–15 minutes per ticket on repetitive triage and vendor
      scheduling; loaded labor cost $25–$40/hour makes each ticket $4–$10 before
      vendor engagement.
    - >-
      Basic issues (tripped breakers, GFCI, garbage disposal resets, pilot
      lights) could be self-resolved; 10–25% are avoidable truck rolls.
    - >-
      SLA adherence is inconsistent; emergencies vs routine not reliably
      separated; risk/liability from mishandled gas/water/electrical issues.
    - >-
      Vendor dispatch friction (finding availability, lockbox codes,
      RBP/landlord approvals) delays resolution; poor visibility into vendor
      performance.
    - >-
      After-hours coverage is expensive (outsourced call centers or on-call
      staff) and resident satisfaction drops.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omni-channel intake: phone/IVR + AI voice, SMS, email parsing, resident
      portal/chat widget; <5s speed-to-answer for voice.
    - >-
      Dynamic data gathering: collect missing details (access constraints,
      media, shutoff status, lease/warranty checks) using adaptive prompts and
      property-specific rules.
    - >-
      Risk classification and troubleshooting: classify emergency/urgent/routine
      using a safety-first playbook; guide residents through safe
      self-diagnostics with step-by-step flows and images/videos.
    - >-
      Smart vendor routing and scheduling: match to preferred vendors by trade,
      zone, SLA, insurance/WO limits; coordinate windows via SMS/IVR links or
      vendor calendar integration; instant calendar holds where supported.
    - >-
      SLA engine: enforce priorities (e.g., water leak <15 min vendor acceptance
      target) and automatic escalation to human on-call if thresholds breach.
    - >-
      PMS sync: create/update work orders, notes, cost centers, tenant
      communication logs; push media and triage transcript to the ticket.
    - >-
      After-visit follow-up: confirm completion, collect CSAT, re-open if
      needed; update vendor scorecards (acceptance time, first-time fix).
    - >-
      Analytics & QA: dashboards for FCR, containment, time-to-dispatch,
      cost/ticket, SLA compliance; red-team and hallucination monitoring; full
      audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 AI triage and dispatch that cuts maintenance coordination cost 50–70%,
    accelerates time-to-dispatch by 3–6x, auto-resolves 15–25% of issues without
    a truck roll, and enforces your SLAs with full PMS and vendor workflow
    integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-PMS, cross-vendor dataset of labeled maintenance interactions and
    outcomes powering high-accuracy triage and vendor routing, plus a
    configurable SLA engine tied directly into PMS workflows—delivering
    measurable savings and faster dispatch without locking customers into a
    single PMS or human call center.
