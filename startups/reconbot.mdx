  problem:
    - >-
      Monthly/shift reconciliation between blast-hole/grade control models,
      mined tonnes, and plant feed/assays is labor-intensive (1–5
      FTE-days/site/month) and error-prone due to manual data wrangling across
      FMS, planning, historian, and LIMS systems.
    - >-
      Unexplained variances (mine call factor swings ±10–30%) drive unplanned
      grade dilution, recovery losses, and missed production targets with
      limited visibility into root causes (e.g., blast movement, misrouting,
      sampling bias, weightometer drift).
    - >-
      Data latency (1–7 days) prevents timely corrective action; reconciliation
      insights arrive after production decisions are locked in.
    - >-
      Disparate systems (Deswik/Datamine/Maptek, Hexagon/Caterpillar/Wenco FMS,
      plant historians, LIMS) lack a unified, auditable chain-of-custody for
      metal accounting compliant with AMIRA P754.
    - >-
      Stockpile inventory uncertainty (±5–20%) obscures true plant feed
      grade/tonnes and confounds budgeting and mine planning updates.
    - >-
      Existing tools focus on reporting (month-end) rather than automated
      anomaly detection, variance decomposition, and prescriptive actions tied
      to shift-level control.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion and harmonization from grade control/blast-hole
      models, FMS dig and haul records, weightometers, stockpile movements,
      plant feed analyzers, and laboratory assays into a governed reconciliation
      schema.
    - >-
      Continuous mass-balance engine that calculates mine call factor, tonnage
      and grade variances at shift/day/bench/pit/stockpile/plant nodes with
      uncertainty bounds.
    - >-
      Variance decomposition using causal/feature attribution to isolate drivers
      (e.g., blast movement vs. sampling bias vs. moisture correction vs.
      routing errors vs. weightometer calibration drift).
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations (e.g., adjust cutoff in dig polygon,
      prioritize survey of blast X, recalibrate Belt Scale #3, update reclaim
      strategy on Stockpile B) with impact estimates in tonnes/grade/recovery.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflows with alerts in Teams/Slack/email when KPIs
      breach thresholds (e.g., >5% tonnage variance on Bench 42, PGNAA vs. LIMS
      bias >2 SD for Ni).
    - >-
      Audit-ready metal accounting with versioned data lineage, reconciliation
      snapshots, sign-offs, and AMIRA P754 reporting packs.
    - >-
      Self-serve dashboards/APIs for planners, geologists, mine ops, and plant
      teams to run what-if scenarios and compare planned vs. actual at multiple
      aggregation levels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-real-time, AMIRA P754-aligned, end-to-end mine-to-mill grade and
    tonnage reconciliation with automated variance detection and root-cause
    attribution—cutting unexplained variance by 20–40%, reducing month-end close
    time by 50–80%, and enabling shift-level corrective actions that recover
    1–3% of metal value.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A reconciliation-specific data model and library of certified connectors
    across the mine-plant-lab ecosystem, combined with a proven variance
    attribution engine and AMIRA P754-compliant audit trails, enabling
    shift-level actions rather than month-end reporting. Cross-site benchmarks
    and prescriptive playbooks create a feedback moat that’s difficult for
    general BI or OEM tools to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Mine and plant leaders (mine managers, geologists, metallurgists) who must
    deliver reliable metal every month without surprises.
  problem: >-
    Disconnected grade control, tonnage, and plant assay data make
    reconciliation slow and contentious; hidden variance drivers (sampling bias,
    ore loss/dilution, misroutes, sensor drift, survey mismatch) cause month-end
    surprises and erode trust.
  guide: >-
    We understand the daily pressure to hit plan with defensible numbers. Our
    mining data scientists and metallurgists built an AI service aligned to
    AMIRA P754 best practices with secure, auditable pipelines and clear
    explainability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sources: blast-hole/grade control, fleet/tonnage, survey,
    stockpiles, belt scales, plant feed/assays. 2) Configure domains and rules:
    dig lines, benches, stockpile IDs, tolerances, balancing constraints. 3)
    Operate: automated daily reconciliation, variance alerts with root-cause
    signals, action tracking, audit-ready month-end close.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and launch a 90‑day site pilot; optionally start with
    a sample variance review and ROI model.
  success: >-
    A single source of truth from mine to mill; faster month-end close; stable
    feed grades; reduced dilution and ore loss; fewer rehandles; credible
    forecasts; aligned mine–plant decisions.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing grade gaps and spreadsheet firefighting; costly misroutes and
    dilution; delayed close and write-offs; audit challenges; continued
    finger-pointing between mine and plant.
