    order to reduce drive time and overtime while respecting time windows and
    capacity.

  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers spend 1–3 hours daily manually building routes, crew
      assignments, and loading plans across whiteboards/spreadsheets, leading to
      inconsistent plans and slow response to day-of changes.
    - >-
      Suboptimal routing and crew matching create 10–20% excess drive time,
      25–40% overtime, and frequent late arrivals against customer time windows
      (AM/PM, building elevator slots).
    - >-
      Crew skills (e.g., piano handling, packing/crating, modular furniture
      disassembly, hoisting, long-carry) are not systematically factored into
      assignments, causing rework, damage risk, and schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Truck capacity and load order are guessed; poor 3D space use and wrong
      loading sequence cause double-handling and 10–20% extra loading/unloading
      time.
    - >-
      Day-of disruptions (traffic, cancellations, job overruns, sick calls) are
      handled ad hoc; no real-time re-optimization or ETA recalculation, causing
      cascading delays and dissatisfied customers.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated analytics; operators can’t quantify the cost of
      overtime, empty miles, or late-window penalties, making margin improvement
      guesses rather than data-driven actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Import tomorrow’s jobs with time windows, inventories/cube estimates,
      access notes, and promised durations from existing move-management
      software.
    - >-
      Auto-generate an optimal plan in under 90 seconds: routes by truck, crew
      assignments by skill, start times, and per-stop load/unload sequencing to
      meet windows while minimizing drive and overtime.
    - >-
      Provide a 3D load plan and pick-path with labels that match unload order,
      reducing double-handling and time at destination.
    - >-
      Model labor rules and cost: shifts, lunch breaks, overtime thresholds,
      prevailing wage/union constraints, and driver qualifications.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization on disruptions (traffic, delay, job overrun,
      no-show) with ETA updates, customer notifications, and crew reassignment
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Dashboards quantify impact: on-time rate, overtime hours and cost, empty
      miles, crew utilization, CO2, job margin by branch/truck/crew.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One system that simultaneously optimizes routes, crew skills, and 3D loading
    sequence—then re-optimizes in real time as the day changes—cutting drive
    time 10–20%, overtime 25–40%, and boosting daily job capacity 5–10% within
    30 days of go-live.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A moving-specific “triple optimizer” (routes + crew skills + 3D load order)
    trained on real operational data and integrated with dominant
    move-management systems, enabling faster time-to-value, higher plan
    adoption, and measurable ROI that generic delivery route tools can’t match.

      state associations (e.g., CMSA); sponsor and run “live optimization”
      workshops; collect pilot signups (target 30+ leads/event).
    - >-
      Content-led inbound: ROI calculator (overtime and empty miles), case
      studies, and SEO around “moving route optimization,” “crew scheduling for

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops managers, dispatchers, and owners of moving companies who want every
    job, crew, and truck planned right the first time.
  problem: >-
    Manual, day-of planning leads to wasted miles, missed time windows,
    unbalanced crews, overtime, and damages from ad-hoc load orders; complexity
    across capacity, skills, traffic, and customer promises overwhelms
    spreadsheets.
  guide: >-
    We understand the 5 a.m. scramble. Our team blends moving-industry know-how
    with proven optimization and packing algorithms to deliver dispatch-ready
    routes, crew assignments, and load sequences that respect time windows,
    capacity, and skills.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your jobs, crews, and trucks via CSV/API; 2) Review the AI
    plan—routes, assignments, load order—with on-time and cost KPIs; 3)
    One-click dispatch and live re-optimize as changes occur.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot with your own jobs and crews.
  success: >-
    Measurably less drive time and overtime, balanced crews, near-perfect
    on-time arrivals, fewer handling touches from smart load order, happier
    customers, and higher profit per truck.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning fuel and hours, miss windows, scramble crews, overload or
    underfill trucks, increase damage and claims, and lose repeat business to
    faster competitors.
