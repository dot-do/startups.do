  problem:
    - >-
      Water quality variability (alkalinity, bicarbonates, hardness, pH) makes
      fertigation and acid dosing error-prone; many growers lack robust
      neutralization calculations across acid types.
    - >-
      Manual recipe building to hit target ppm of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, micros
      while balancing cation/anion ratios and EC is time-consuming and requires
      expert agronomy.
    - >-
      Seasonal shifts in water chemistry and crop demand cause pH drift,
      precipitation (e.g., calcium phosphate), and inconsistent growth if
      schedules aren’t adjusted.
    - >-
      Acid selection and injection rates are difficult to compute safely
      (compatibility, corrosion, legal concentration limits, worker safety),
      leading to risk and compliance gaps.
    - >-
      Growers juggle multiple data sources (lab PDFs, sensor logs, tissue/water
      analyses, growth-stage calendars) with limited integration and no
      closed-loop feedback.
    - >-
      Cost pressure: fertilizer and acid prices fluctuate; growers need
      cost-optimized programs without compromising plant health.
    - >-
      Lack of auditable records for regulators, audits, certifications (e.g.,
      nutrient management plans), and customers (retail chains, landscape
      contractors).
    - >-
      Skilled labor shortage; head growers spend hours per week on calculations
      and training irrigation staff.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven recipe engine converts water/tissue analyses, substrate type,
      and growth stage into fertilizer blends that hit target ppm, EC, and
      cation/anion balance.
    - >-
      Acid injection planner computes neutralization requirements (for sulfuric,
      nitric, phosphoric, citric, etc.) based on alkalinity (as CaCO3), target
      pH, flow rate, and injector ratio—plus safety and compatibility checks.
    - >-
      Dynamic feeding schedules that adjust by phenology, temperature/GDD,
      irrigation volume, and lab feedback; generates weekly injection tables and
      SOPs for staff.
    - >-
      Compatibility and precipitation risk modeling (e.g., Ca x P product
      thresholds by pH/temperature) to prevent line clogging and micronutrient
      lockout.
    - >-
      Cost optimizer chooses among available SKUs and acids to minimize
      $/acre-week while meeting agronomic constraints and supply limitations.
    - >-
      Integrations: parse lab PDFs/CSVs via API, push setpoints to fertigation
      controllers, and log sensor data (pH/EC/flow) for closed-loop
      verification.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit center: automatic logs of applications (nutrients,
      acids), safety notes, labels/SDS links, and printable nutrient management
      plans.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate recipe changes, acid type swaps, or water
      source changes and see cost and pH stability impacts before
      implementation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn lab analyses and growth stages into precise, safe, and cost-optimized
