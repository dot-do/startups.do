leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers receive thousands of disparate SDS/TDS from hundreds of
      suppliers; formats, versions, and languages vary widely, making
      centralization and search slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Manual extraction of hazards, PPE, transport, VOC, and handling data from
      PDFs is time-consuming (0.1–0.3 FTE per 1,000 documents) and error-prone,
      increasing compliance risk.
    - >-
      SDS bundles are not consistently attached to orders/shipments or tailored
      to customer/location requirements (e.g., GHS/OSHA vs. WHMIS vs. CLP),
      creating audit gaps and potential fines.
    - >-
      Version drift (outdated SDS) and supplier-induced changes are hard to
      detect; audit trails and document retention requirements are cumbersome
      without systemized governance.
    - >-
      Existing SDS tools focus on authoring or static repositories, not on
      high-accuracy data extraction and per-order SDS bundling integrated with
      ERP/EDI/e-commerce.
    - >-
      Regulatory monitoring (OSHA HazCom 2012, GHS, WHMIS 2015, EU CLP/REACH) is
      fragmented; mapping product hazards to evolving rules is manual and
      inconsistent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Centralized SDS/TDS library that ingests via email dropbox, SFTP, vendor
      portal, or API; deduplicates, versions, and normalizes documents across
      suppliers/languages.
    - >-
      AI extraction (OCR + NER) of hazards, H/P statements, pictograms, PPE,
      storage/handling, transport (UN/IMDG/IATA), VOC/solvent content, flash
      point, product identifiers; with confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop
      QA where needed.
    - >-
      Automated SDS bundling: When an order is created (via ERP/e-comm/EDI),
      generate and attach the right SDS package (language, regulation set,
      latest version) by ship-to location and customer profile.
    - >-
      Regulatory mapping and monitoring: Aligns extracted fields to OSHA
      HazCom/GHS/WHMIS/CLP schemas, tracks version currency, flags gaps and
      supplier updates, and maintains audit trails.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins for ERP/WMS/e-commerce (Epicor, Infor, MS Dynamics 365,
      SAP B1, NetSuite; Shopify/BigCommerce B2B) to embed search, bundle, and
      print/attach flows.
    - >-
      Dashboards and alerts: coverage %, staleness, extraction accuracy,
      non-compliant orders, supplier responsiveness, and audit readiness KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy supplier SDS/TDS into a governed, searchable compliance data
    layer that auto-generates the right, current SDS bundle per
    order/customer—cutting compliance time by 70%+ and reducing audit risk to
    near-zero.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned SDS/TDS extraction stack with proprietary labeled datasets
    for coatings and a per-order SDS bundling engine tightly integrated with
    ERPs/EDI—delivering measurable compliance outcomes (≥99.5% bundle coverage)
    competitors focused on static repositories or authoring do not offer.
    Accumulating network effects from supplier relationships and
    document/version telemetry further improve accuracy and time-to-update.

    Supplies Merchant Wholesalers (NAICS 424950)

    Desire: Instantly deliver accurate, compliant SDS/TDS bundles for every
    order and customer—without manual work.
  problem: >-
    External: Supplier SDS/TDS are scattered, inconsistent, and frequently
    updated; manual extraction of hazards/handling/shipping is slow and
    error-prone; varying regs (GHS/OSHA/WHMIS/REACH/DOT) create complexity.

    Internal: Teams feel stretched, anxious about audits and shipment delays,
    and tired of copy/paste rework.

    Philosophical: Compliance should accelerate sales and safety—every customer
    deserves accurate, accessible safety data at the moment of fulfillment.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the chaos of wrangling hundreds of SDS/TDS across
    suppliers, versions, and formats.

    Authority: Purpose-built AI for coatings chemicals; robust parsing across
    diverse SDS layouts; regulatory mapping; version control; audit trails;
    secure by design; human-in-the-loop QA when needed.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Ingest: Connect supplier portals/email drops/SFTP/S3 and bulk-import
    PDFs.

    2) Extract & Normalize: Parse hazards, handling/storage, transport,
    first-aid, composition; map to GHS/OSHA/WHMIS/REACH; de-duplicate and
    version.

    3) Deliver: Auto-generate customer-ready, branded SDS bundles per
    order/customer via API, web portal, or ERP/WMS plug-in.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Security: Encryption, role-based access, audit logs.

    - Compliance Confidence: Document provenance, timestamps, change history.

    - Support & SLAs: Onboarding assistance, uptime and response targets.
