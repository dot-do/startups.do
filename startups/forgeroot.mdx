  problem:
    - >-
      High and variable cost of poor quality (CoPQ) in iron and steel forging:
      typically 1–5% of sales per plant, driven by scrap, rework, sorting, and
      warranty exposure.
    - >-
      Slow, inconsistent defect triage: technicians spend 20–60 minutes per
      incident classifying defects and drafting containment/corrective actions;
      variability across shifts and plants.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis delays: 1–3 weeks to converge on likely causes due to
      tribal knowledge, incomplete data capture, and fragmented systems
      (MES/QMS/SPC).
    - >-
      Manual 8D/A3 documentation burden: quality engineers spend 25–40% of time
      compiling evidence, photos, and narratives for audits (IATF 16949,
      customer PPAP).
    - >-
      Limited visibility and feedback loops: defect images/notes stored on local
      drives; learnings don’t generalize across lines/plants, causing repeat
      failures.
    - >-
      Skill gaps and turnover: shortage of experienced metallurgists/process
      engineers, increasing ramp-up time and error rates for newer staff.
    - >-
      In-line vision systems exist but rarely link to metallurgical root causes
      or recommended corrective actions, resulting in detection without
      diagnosis.
  solution:
    - >-
      Near-line/in-line defect classification from images (surface/geometry) and
      notes, with confidence scores and explainability overlays.
    - >-
      Cause-mapping engine combining a forging defect ontology with process
      parameters (billet temperature, die wear, lube, press tonnage/ram speed,
      alignment) to rank likely root causes.
    - >-
      Automated 8D/A3 drafting that compiles evidence, photos, SPC snippets, and
      recommended containment/corrective actions aligned to plant templates.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: operator feedback and disposition labels retrain
      models; scenario library for recurring issues.
    - >-
      Integrations to MES/QMS/SPC (e.g., SAP ME, Siemens Opcenter, Plex, ETQ) to
      pull context and push dispositions/actions.
    - >-
      Edge/on-prem deployment for low latency and data security; optional cloud
      for fleet learning using privacy-preserving techniques.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard tracking scrap/rework reduction, time-to-root-cause,
      downtime avoided, and audit readiness.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An explainable AI agent purpose-built for iron and steel forging that
    classifies defects from images/notes, maps them to likely
    metallurgical/process causes, and drafts 8D/A3 containment/corrective
    actions—cutting triage time by 60%+, reducing repeat defects by 30–50%, and
    improving first-pass yield by 0.5–2.0 percentage points with seamless
    MES/QMS integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, privacy-preserved, cross-plant dataset and ontology specific to
    iron and steel forging that links visual signatures to metallurgical/root
    causes and proven corrective actions—combined with an 8D/A3 generator
    embedded in plant workflows. This domain-specific knowledge, plus validated
    connectors and edge deployment patterns for harsh environments, is difficult
    and time-consuming for generalist AI vendors to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality managers, process engineers, and forging cell leaders in iron and
    steel plants who want faster, reliable defect triage and repeat-defect
    prevention without slowing production.
  problem: >-
    Defects are caught late; RCA is slow, subjective, and scattered across
    photos, notes, and spreadsheets—driving scrap, rework, missed shipments, and
    repeat escapes.
  guide: >-
    We combine metallurgical expertise with vision/NLP models trained on iron
    and steel forging defects and 8D/A3 best practices; we understand shop-floor
    firefighting and deliver a pragmatic, validated workflow.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect MES/QMS or drag-drop images and notes; 2) The agent classifies
    defects, maps likely root causes with confidence, and highlights process
    contributors; 3) It drafts containment/corrective actions (8D/A3), assigns
    owners, tracks closure, and learns from outcomes.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo or start a 2-week pilot using your last 90 days of
    defect data.
  success: >-
    Minutes to triage, faster 8D closure, fewer repeat defects, higher yield/OEE
    and Cpk, audit-ready traceability, and captured know-how that scales across
    shifts and sites.
  failure: >-
    Stay in firefight mode: rising cost of quality, delivery risk, customer
    chargebacks/PPM hits, and knowledge drain as experts retire.
