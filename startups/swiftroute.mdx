  title: AI Route Optimization & Auto-Dispatch
  description: >-
    Optimize daily routes with time windows, capacity, traffic, and driver
    constraints; push routes to driver apps and re-optimize on exceptions.
  targetUsers:
    - Local courier/messenger firms (2–200 drivers)
    - Dispatch managers
    - Ops directors
  triggers:
    - Order cutoff reached
    - New rush/overflow order arrives
    - Driver callout/vehicle issue
  inputs:
    - 'Order list (pickup/drop, time windows, service level)'
    - 'Driver roster (skills, start location, shift)'
    - Vehicle capacity/constraints
    - Traffic/road restrictions
    - Depot/zone definitions
  steps:
    - 1) Ingest orders via API/webhook or CSV
    - 2) Validate/geocode addresses; dedupe
    - '3) Build VRP with constraints (time windows, capacities, priorities)'
    - 4) Solve with OR-Tools; compute ETAs with live traffic
    - '5) Human review optional; apply business rules (client SLAs, driver prefs)'
    - 6) Push route/manifest to TMS/driver app; notify drivers
    - 7) Monitor exceptions; auto re-optimization and re-dispatch
  tools:
    - 'Google Maps/Mapbox (Geocoding, Traffic)'
    - OR-Tools or Routific/OptimoRoute API
    - Onfleet/Bringg/DispatchTrack API
    - PostgreSQL/Airtable
    - Slack/Email
  outputs:
    - Driver assignments and sequenced stops
    - Stop-level ETAs
    - Route KPIs (distance/time/utilization)
    - Change log for audit
  pricingModel:
    - Setup fee (data/connectors)
    - Monthly subscription tiered by drivers/orders
    - Per re-optimization event

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      SMB courier and local delivery operators still plan routes manually or
      with static tools, leading to 15–30% excess miles and low driver
      utilization.
    - >-
      Existing tools struggle with dynamic constraints (tight time windows,
      capacity, breaks, vehicle types, skills), real-time traffic, and driver
      no-shows/vehicle issues.
    - >-
      Dispatchers cannot react quickly to exceptions; a failed delivery or late
      pickup cascades into missed SLAs across the route.
    - >-
      Customers expect accurate ETAs and proactive notifications, but current
      systems often have ETA MAE >10 minutes and on-time rates <85–90%.
    - >-
      Integrating orders from multiple sources (Shopify, WooCommerce, EDI, phone
      orders) and pushing routes to diverse driver apps is complex and brittle.
    - >-
      Operators lack live visibility into SLA risk and cost per stop, making it
      hard to balance service promises and profitability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud optimization engine for VRP with time windows (VRPTW), capacity,
      multi-depot, pickups/dropoffs, skills, shifts, and driver preferences.
    - >-
      Traffic-aware, low-latency solver with streaming order intake;
      re-optimizes automatically when drivers are delayed, orders change, or
      vehicles fail.
    - >-
      Auto-dispatch connector that pushes routes to popular driver apps or our
      lightweight SDK; supports reassignments mid-shift.
    - >-
      Live control tower for dispatchers: SLA risk scoring, what-if simulation,
      and one-click rebalancing across drivers/depots.
    - >-
      Accurate ETAs with city/time-of-day models; proactive SMS/email
      notifications and customer tracking links.
    - >-
      Open APIs and prebuilt connectors (Shopify, WooCommerce, ShipStation,
      Zapier, Onfleet, Tookan, Shipday, Samsara/Geotab).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy, same-day orders into optimized, auto-dispatched routes that
    continuously adapt to traffic and exceptions—achieving 15–25% fewer miles
    and 95%+ on-time deliveries without adding dispatch headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built, low-latency re-optimization loop that incorporates live
    traffic, real driver behavior, and SLA priorities—plus a broad integration
    layer that lets fleets keep their existing driver apps. Over time, city- and
    vertical-specific ETA and service-time models learned from anonymized data
    create compounding accuracy and efficiency gains competitors without this
    data cannot match.

  character: >-
    Owners/dispatchers of local messenger and last‑mile delivery fleets who must
    plan and dispatch daily routes under tight time windows.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual routing under time windows, capacities, traffic, and driver
    rules is slow and brittle; exceptions break the plan. Internal: Dispatchers
    feel overwhelmed and blind once drivers roll. Philosophical: Local delivery
    shouldn’t be guesswork—customers deserve on‑time, efficient service.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of same‑day local delivery. Our AI routing and
    auto‑dispatch engine has optimized millions of stops, respects real‑world
    constraints, integrates with driver apps, and keeps humans in control.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect orders, drivers, and constraints 2) Auto‑optimize routes
    with time windows, capacity, traffic, and driver rules 3) One‑tap dispatch
    to driver apps 4) Live tracking and auto re‑optimization on exceptions 5)
    Review KPIs and refine. Agreement: fast setup, no lock‑in, secure data,
    human override anytime.
