leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High inbound call/chat volume for benefit, accumulator, and PA status
      inquiries drives contact costs ($6–$12 per voice call).
    - >-
      Agents struggle to find accurate answers across fragmented systems (claims
      host, eligibility, PA, formulary), increasing AHT and transfers.
    - >-
      Members/providers lack self-service options for real-time benefits/PA
      details and lower-cost alternatives, depressing CSAT and adherence.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit risk: inconsistent answers vs plan documents;
      insufficient documentation and disclosures; HIPAA/HITRUST requirements.
    - >-
      Limited insight into intent patterns and root causes (e.g., PA denials,
      tier changes) hinders benefit design and operations improvements.
    - >-
      Existing chatbots are generic, lack deep PBM/TPA integrations
      (accumulators, formulary, ePA), and underperform on first-contact
      resolution.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel AI agent (voice, chat, portal, SMS) with secure identity
      verification (KBA, OTP, OAuth) and consent capture.
    - >-
      Real-time integrations: eligibility (X12 270/271, FHIR Coverage),
      accumulators/OOP, claims/EOB (FHIR EOB), PA/ePA status (NCPDP SCRIPT, FHIR
      PAS), formulary/drug pricing (FDB/Medi-Span), network directory and
      pricing.
    - >-
      Dynamic Q&A and guided flows for common intents: benefits,
      deductibles/caps, claim status, PA criteria/status, step therapy, tier
      exceptions, pharmacy network options, mail-order conversions.
    - >-
      Therapeutic and channel alternatives with estimated member cost impact
      (e.g., 30/90-day, mail vs retail, preferred vs standard pharmacy);
      captures acceptance and pushes changes (where allowed) or generates
      provider-ready messages.
    - >-
      Agent-assist mode for call centers: next-best action, policy snippets with
      citations, real-time form prefill, and after-call summaries into CRM
      (e.g., Salesforce, ServiceNow).
    - >-
      Audit-ready conversation records, disclosures, decision trails, and policy
      citations; robust PHI redaction for training and analytics.
    - >-
      Analytics: intent taxonomy, containment rate, root-cause drivers (e.g.,
      top PA denial reasons), benefit design insights, and compliance QA
      dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An omnichannel, compliance-grade copilot that authenticates
    members/providers, retrieves real-time benefits/accumulators/PA status,
    explains coverage in plain language, recommends clinically appropriate
    lower-cost alternatives, and auto-summarizes interactions to your
    CRM—reducing contact costs and improving FCR without compromising
    HIPAA/HITRUST standards.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt PBM/TPA connectors and a healthcare-governed RAG layer with
    policy-citation guarantees, coupled with a clinically curated alternatives
    engine and compliance telemetry. Over time, proprietary, de-identified
    intent/answer datasets and accuracy/QoS benchmarks create a performance moat
    that generalist chatbots and new entrants lack.
