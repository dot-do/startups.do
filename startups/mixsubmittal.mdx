leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Submittal creation for concrete mixes is manual and error-prone; typical
      cycle is 5–10 business days with 1–3 rejections per project section.
    - >-
      Specs vary widely (ACI 318/301, owner additions, DOT/local durability
      tables); mapping requirements to f’c, w/cm, air, SCM limits,
      sulfate/chloride exposure, and finishing aids is time-consuming.
    - >-
      Low‑carbon/EPD requirements (LEED v4.1, Buy Clean, owner CO2 caps) are
      increasing, but EPD sourcing and documentation are fragmented.
    - >-
      Supplier data (plant certifications, historical test data, admixture data
      sheets) is scattered across emails and portals, causing missing items in
      packages.
    - >-
      Delays in approvals push pour dates, create premium freight/hours, and
      incur general conditions costs.
    - >-
      Contractors lack standardized, engineer-accepted templates; re-submittals
      and clarifications drain PM/engineer bandwidth.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload project specs/drawings; AI parses Division 03 30 00 and related
      tables to extract constraints (f’c, w/cm, air, slump, exposure class, SCM
      % limits, cement type, chloride limits).
    - >-
      Recommend compliant mix families using a rules engine + local supplier
      capability graph (available cements/SCMs, aggregates, admixtures) and
      project means/methods (pumpability, finish schedule, temperature).
    - >-
      Auto-assemble submittal packages: cover sheet, mix data sheets, EPDs
      (cement/SCM/concrete), plant certifications, admixture/cement product
      data, historical strength data, curing/placement procedures.
    - >-
      Low‑carbon optimization: propose alternatives that meet spec while
      minimizing kg CO2e/m3 with side-by-side comparison and EC3 export.
    - >-
      Integrations: push to Procore/Autodesk Build submittals, track reviewer
      comments, versioning, and approval dates; supplier portal for quick
      confirmations.
    - >-
      Optional PE review/stamp via partner network for jurisdictions/owners
      requiring sealed submittals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate compliant concrete mix submittal packages in under 24 hours with
    70%+ automation, 90%+ first-pass acceptance, and embedded EPDs/supplier
    certs—cutting approval cycles and rework while meeting ACI/ASTM and owner
    carbon requirements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving acceptance graph linking spec clauses, owner/EOR
    preferences, supplier capabilities, and real approval outcomes—plus producer
    partnerships and optional PE stamping—that competitors without workflow
    depth and data access cannot easily replicate.
