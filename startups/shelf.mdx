  problem:
    - >-
      Perishable prepared food makers (salads, ready meals, fresh bakery,
      fresh-cut produce, dairy/short-life, commissaries) lose 2–8% of
      finished-goods revenue to expiries, markdowns, and write‑offs due to
      static FIFO rules and manual lot picking.
    - >-
      Retailers and foodservice customers enforce minimum‑remaining‑shelf‑life
      (MRSL) and “code date” policies that are inconsistently applied, causing
      rejected loads, chargebacks, and lost OTIF performance.
    - >-
      Current ERP/WMS FEFO logic ignores dynamic shelf‑life degradation from
      temperature abuse, dwell time, and route duration; lots that look
      compliant at pick-time fail MRSL at receiving.
    - >-
      Planners lack a way to co‑optimize lot allocation with routing and order
      promising; they must trade off service level, freshness, and waste
      manually in spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Limited traceability and auditability of allocation decisions increase
      compliance risk (e.g., FSMA 204) and slow root‑cause analysis for spoilage
      claims.
    - >-
      Short shelf life makes planning cycles tight; without real‑time allocation
      updates, late orders or route changes cascade into waste and service
      failures.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic remaining shelf‑life estimation using product‑specific models that
      adjust for time‑temperature exposure, dwell time, and handling events.
    - >-
      FEFO++ allocation engine that selects compliant lots at pick‑time and
      re‑optimizes with late orders, substitutions, and route changes.
    - >-
      Freshness‑aware ATP/CTP: promises orders only if a lot‑route combo can
      meet customer MRSL and delivery windows.
    - >-
      Route‑integrated allocation: co‑optimizes lot selection with route
      duration and stop sequence to maximize delivered remaining shelf life
      (DRSL).
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trail: records allocation rationale (MRSL,
      temperature, timestamps) for dispute resolution and traceability.
    - >-
      Simulation “what‑if” sandbox to evaluate policy changes (MRSL thresholds,
      cut‑off times, safety stock) and quantify waste/service trade‑offs.
    - >-
      Exception management: flags lots at risk of expiry, creates pull‑forward
      offers (discounts or channel reallocation), and suggests pick/ship
      priorities.
    - >-
      Lightweight integrations with ERP/WMS/MES/TMS and IoT cold‑chain sensors;
      near‑real‑time API plus batch fallbacks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce expiry write‑offs by 30–50% and improve OTIF‑Fresh to 98%+ by
    allocating lots to orders and routes using dynamic remaining shelf life
    (FEFO++), factoring temperature history, customer MRSL rules, and transit
    durations—embedded in your existing ERP/WMS/TMS with measurable ROI in under
    12 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary DRSL models calibrated with cross‑customer time‑temperature and
    spoilage data, plus a maintained retailer MRSL/code‑date policy library and
    prebuilt integrations enabling 8–12 week time‑to‑value. Closed‑loop learning
    from allocation outcomes on specific lanes continuously improves
    performance—hard for generic ERP/WMS rules to match.

  character: >-
    Ops, planning, and distribution leaders at perishable prepared-food
    manufacturers who must allocate lots to orders and routes fast, accurately,
    and FEFO-compliant.
  problem: >-
    External: Short shelf-life, volatile demand, multi-lot inventory, and
    complex routing make manual allocation slow and error-prone—leading to
    expiries, write-offs, chargebacks, and FEFO (First Expire, First Out) audit
    risk.

    Internal: Constant firefighting and stress over waste, penalties, and
    service failures.

    Philosophical: Food is made to be eaten, not thrown away—compliance and
    sustainability shouldn’t be a trade-off.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the daily pressure of tight cutoffs, retailer SLAs, and
    zero-tolerance FEFO audits.

    Authority: Built by practitioners in perishable manufacturing, combining
    optimization and ML; integrates with ERP/WMS; follows industry FEFO best
    practices and data-security standards.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect ERP/WMS and inventory data.

    2) Configure shelf-life rules, FEFO policies, and customer/SLA constraints.

    3) Run AI allocation to assign lots to orders and routes by remaining
    shelf-life.

    4) Approve in-app or auto-apply to picking and shipping.

    5) Monitor waste, OTIF, and compliance; refine continuously.

    Agreement plan:

    - Transparent recommendations with override controls.

    - No disruption to existing pick/ship flows.

    - Secure data handling and clear success criteria for pilot.
