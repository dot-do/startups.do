leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs in NAICS 336999 are document-heavy (PDF drawings, STEP/SolidWorks
      files, BOM spreadsheets, specifications) and take 3–10 hours each to parse
      and estimate, throttling quote throughput.
    - >-
      Estimating accuracy varies widely (±20–40%) due to manual data extraction,
      missing tolerances/specs, and inconsistent cost models, leading to margin
      erosion or lost bids.
    - >-
      Small/mid-sized Tier 2/3 suppliers lack standardized risk assessment
      (compliance, tolerance stack-ups, supply volatility) causing rework,
      change orders, and delivery risk.
    - >-
      Sales cycle time is long (3–7 days) while prime contractors expect rapid
      turnarounds; slow quotes reduce win rates and damage relationships.
    - >-
      Knowledge is trapped in senior estimators’ heads and spreadsheets;
      turnover or workload spikes create bottlenecks and inconsistent outcomes.
    - >-
      Auditable cost rationale is required for regulated and defense-adjacent
      work (ITAR, Buy America/Trade Agreements Act), but teams struggle to
      produce traceable, defensible estimates quickly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated RFQ ingestion (email/upload/API) for PDFs, images, Excel BOMs,
      and common 3D/2D CAD (STEP, SolidWorks, DXF/DWG).
    - >-
      AI-powered extraction of features/tolerances/material callouts, process
      routing suggestions (fabrication, machining, welding, painting, assembly,
      harnessing), and labor/machine time modeling.
    - >-
      Live cost build-up: materials (sheet/plate, composites, bar stock, COTS
      components), labor grades, machine rates, overheads, tooling/fixture
      amortization, freight, and contingency.
    - >-
      Risk engine: tolerance/DFMA issues, supply chain volatility, long-lead
      parts, compliance flags (ITAR/CUI, Buy America), and schedule risks with
      severity scoring and mitigations.
    - >-
      Draft quote package: pricing breakdown, lead-time rationale, scope
      inclusions/exclusions, assumptions, and compliance statements; export to
      PDF/Word and sync to CRM/ERP.
    - >-
      Closed-loop calibration: compare estimates to actuals from ERP/MES to
      auto-tune time standards, scrap factors, and vendor pricing by
      commodity/class.
    - >-
      Auditability: clickable lineage from quote line items back to source
      drawings/specs/BOM cells with version control.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFQ-to-quote time by 50–70% and improve estimate accuracy to within
    ±8–12% of actuals by automatically parsing drawings/specs/BOMs, generating
    defensible cost/time models, flagging risks, and producing ready-to-send
    quote narratives—securely and compliantly.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop calibration on each customer’s ERP actuals plus
    transportation-specific process libraries and compliance-ready deployments
    (ITAR/CUI). Competitors are generic or job-shop focused; we combine deep
    domain models, auditability, and on-prem/GovCloud options to meet regulated
    buyer demands.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Estimators, sales engineers, and operations leaders at custom transportation
    equipment manufacturers (NAICS 336999) who must turn complex RFQs into
    accurate quotes fast
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as drawings, specs, and BOMs that are slow to parse
    and easy to miss costs and risks. Internal: Teams feel constant pressure to
    respond faster without sacrificing accuracy. Philosophical: Manufacturers
    should win on engineering know‑how, not lose time to manual data wrangling.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the scramble of bid deadlines and the risk of thin margins.
    Authority: Built by former estimators and AI engineers, trained on
    manufacturing cost structures, with secure handling of sensitive RFQs and
    integrations to your systems.
  plan: >-
    Simple plan: 1) Upload the RFQ package. 2) AI extracts requirements,
    estimates cost and lead time, flags risks, and drafts quote text. 3) You
    review, adjust assumptions, and export to ERP CRM PDF. Adoption plan: Pilot
    on past RFQs, calibrate cost models, go live with your workflow. Risk
    reversal: Private deployment options and clear data ownership.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 2‑week pilot with your RFQs.
    Transitional: Get the RFQ readiness checklist and sample estimate pack.
  success: >-
    Quote 3x faster with consistent accuracy. Improve win rate and margins by
    surfacing risks and assumptions early. Standardize estimating across teams
    with an audit trail. Feed clean data to ERP CRM for smoother handoff and
    better capacity planning.
  failure: >-
    Slow responses lose bids. Underquoting erodes margins and creates fire
    drills. Overquoting prices you out. Tribal estimating knowledge walks out
    the door. Hidden risks cause rework, delays, and customer churn.
