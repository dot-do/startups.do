  title: Dynamic Markdown & Shelf-Life Pricing Assistant
  description: >-
    Predict remaining shelf-life by lot/species and suggest timed markdowns to
    clear inventory profitably.
  targetUsers:
    - Store managers
    - Merchandisers
  triggers:
    - Hourly during business hours
    - Temperature excursion detected
    - New delivery received
  inputs:
    - Receiving date/time per lot
    - Species/cut and handling method
    - Temperature logs (case/truck)
    - Current inventory and sell-through
    - Cost and price floors
    - Promotion constraints
  steps:
    - Estimate effective remaining shelf-life using species model + temp history
    - Forecast sell-through under current price
    - 'Optimize markdown schedule (e.g., 10% at 3pm) to hit sell-through targets'
    - Generate updated prices/labels; push promos to POS and signage
    - Monitor results; auto-adjust markdowns within guardrails
  tools:
    - POS API for price updates
    - Bluetooth/IoT temp logs (CSV/API)
    - Optimization in Python
    - Label PDF generator (ZPL/PDF)
    - Slack alerts
  outputs:
    - Markdown plan with timestamps
    - Printable shelf labels (PDF/ZPL)
    - POS price updates
    - End-of-day sell-through report
  pricingModel:
    - $150–$400/location/month
    - 'Optional add-on: label template setup $300'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:

  risks:
    - Regulatory/brand issues if prices change too often
    - Bad temp data misguides shelf-life
    - Staff misses label changes
  dependencies:
    - Access to inventory-by-lot
    - POS price change permissions
    - Consistent temp logging

  problem:
    - >-
      High shrink in fresh seafood (typical 12–25% by value) due to uncertain
      remaining shelf-life and conservative discard rules
    - >-
      Markdowns are ad hoc; stores often mark down too late or too deep, leaving
      gross margin on the table
    - >-
      No lot/species-level visibility; temperature abuse from boat-to-counter is
      rarely captured in pricing decisions
    - >-
      Manual relabeling and compliance logging are slow and error-prone, risking
      fines and customer trust
    - >-
      Seafood demand is volatile and elastic by daypart and weather; static
      price books don’t react to real-world conditions
    - >-
      Store teams lack decision support during peak hours; managers can’t A/B
      test or measure markdown effectiveness
    - >-
      Category managers can’t quantify waste reduction ROI across
      districts/chains, hindering scaling of best practices
  solution:
    - >-
      Lot/species shelf-life prediction: ingest receiving logs, time–temperature
      histories, species attributes, and storage practices to estimate remaining
      shelf-life (RSL) with confidence bands
    - >-
      Dynamic markdown engine: propose a time-phased markdown schedule (e.g.,
      10% at T-36h, 25% at T-18h, 40% at T-8h) that maximizes expected gross
      profit given demand elasticity and RSL risk
    - >-
      Workflow and execution: one-tap approval flows on mobile; push price
      changes to POS, scales/label printers, ESLs; auto-generate compliant
      labels and signage
    - >-
      Compliance and audit: maintain immutable logs of markdown rationale,
      labels, and disposal decisions for regulator or QA audits
    - >-
      Real-time guardrails: block sale when RSL<=0; enforce species/regional
      rules (e.g., raw consumption, thawed-previously-frozen)
    - >-
      Measurement and learning: A/B test markdown strategies by store/SKU;
      continuously update elasticity and RSL models per store and season
    - >-
      Forecasting and ordering feedback: surface SKU/day recommendations to
      reduce over-ordering for frequent waste items
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict species- and lot-specific remaining shelf-life using
    time–temperature data and recommend timed markdowns that maximize
    sell-through and profit, with push-button execution to POS/scales and
    auditable compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Validated, species-specific RSL models tied to store-level demand and
    integrated execution to POS/scales/ESLs, plus a growing cross-retailer
    dataset of time–temperature-to-outcome that new entrants lack.

  character: >-
    Seafood category managers and store operators who must maximize margin and
    minimize waste on ultra-perishable fish and shellfish.
  problem: >-
    External: seafood spoils quickly with lot-to-lot variability and volatile
    demand; manual markdowns are late or too deep. Internal: constant guessing
    creates stress and missed targets. Philosophical: responsibly caught seafood
    shouldn’t end up in the bin.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of freshness, margins, and brand trust. Our AI
    predicts remaining shelf-life by lot and species, then recommends timed
    markdowns that clear inventory profitably while protecting quality and
    compliance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect POS, inventory, and temperature/receiving data; 2) Calibrate
    species/lot shelf-life models; 3) Auto-generate price ladders and publish to
    labels and e-comm; 4) Review outcomes in a simple dashboard and refine
    rules.
  callToAction: 'Book a 20-minute demo, then launch a 30-day pilot in one district.'
  success: >-
    Lower shrink, higher gross margin dollars, fresher counters, confident
    pricing, clear traceability, happier customers, and less waste.
  failure: >-
    Guesswork continues: expired product, margin erosion, price confusion,
    compliance risk, and avoidable food waste.

  problem:
    - Perishables spoil before they find a buyer.
    - 'Static discounts go too early or too late, training customers to wait.'
    - Staff waste hours checking dates and updating price labels.
    - End-of-day waste erodes margins and sustainability goals.
    - No clear visibility into lot-level freshness risk by species.
    - 'Prices aren’t synced across POS, scales, and e-commerce.'
    - Hard to enforce margin and brand guardrails at store level.
