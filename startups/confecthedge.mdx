  problem:
    - >-
      Extreme cocoa price volatility (weekly moves >10% common in 2024–2025)
      creates budget shocks and margin erosion for chocolate and confectionery
      manufacturers.
    - >-
      Procurement teams struggle to translate demand plans into timed buy
      windows and hedge layers under policy constraints (e.g., max tenor,
      min/max hedge ratios, counterparty limits).
    - >-
      Fragmented data across futures, physicals, sugar, FX, and supplier
      contracts makes timely, consistent decisions difficult; manual
      spreadsheets lead to missed opportunities.
    - >-
      Lack of quantitative, auditable rationale for trades exposes teams to
      governance and audit risk (IFRS 9/ASC 815 documentation deficits).
    - >-
      Hedging effectiveness is reduced by basis risk between supplier
      pass-through formulas and futures indices (ICE Cocoa, ICE No.11 sugar),
      and by FX exposure on non-USD costs and sales.
    - >-
      Limited internal quantitative capability to maintain models, backtests,
      and stress tests tuned to confectionery demand and production calendars.
    - >-
      Poor integration between ERP/MRP demand signals and market execution
      drives over/under-hedging and working capital inefficiency.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on monitoring of cocoa, sugar, and FX with explainable signals that
      identify statistically favorable buy windows and hedge layers, constrained
      by each client’s policy and exposures.
    - >-
      Policy-aware optimization engine recommends trade timing, size, and
      instrument (futures, options, OTC structures) to achieve target hedge
      ratios across tenors while minimizing expected cost and VaR.
    - >-
      Integration to ERP/MRP (SAP, Oracle, D365) to translate production plans
      into time-phased commodity exposures and auto-generate hedge proposals and
      purchase schedules.
    - >-
      Hedge accounting and governance pack generation (designation memos,
      effectiveness testing, audit trails) to meet IFRS 9/ASC 815 requirements.
    - >-
      Scenario, stress, and backtest suite quantifying P&L-at-risk, budget
      coverage, and carry costs under alternative strategies and shocks.
    - >-
      Supplier pass-through/basis modeling to align hedges with contract indices
      (e.g., LIFFE vs ICE, freight differentials, quality premia).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven commodity procurement and hedge advisor purpose-built for
    chocolate and confectionery manufacturing that converts cocoa/sugar/FX
    volatility into actionable, policy-aligned buy and hedge decisions,
    improving margin certainty and governance. Typical outcome: 2–5% reduction
    in weighted-average input cost variance and 20–40% improvement in hedge
    policy compliance within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, policy-aware optimization models specifically tuned to
    confectionery exposures that unify cocoa, sugar, and FX in one decision
    engine, with automated hedge accounting documentation and supplier basis
    calibration. Accumulating anonymized timing and basis benchmarks across
    clients improve recommendations over time, creating a defensible data
    network effect.
