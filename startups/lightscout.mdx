  problem:
    - >-
      Commercial photo teams spend 8–20 hours per shoot on remote scouting,
      light planning, and logistics, often across multiple tools and sources.
    - >-
      Missed sun angles, unexpected shadows, or cloud cover cause reschedules; a
      weather or light miss can cost $2,000–$25,000 in talent, crew, and
      location fees.
    - >-
      Access surprises (permits, parking, restricted areas, tide/drone zones)
      create on‑site delays and risk; information is fragmented across municipal
      sites and forums.
    - >-
      Producers need fast turnarounds on bids/boards; building a credible
      location pack and day schedule typically takes 1–3 days.
    - >-
      No single tool ties look-matching + sun/shadow + weather windows + access
      + shot order into an exportable, client-ready pack with backups.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve brief intake: user sets look/style references, max travel
      radius, terrain/urban preferences, access constraints, date range, budget,
      and special needs (e.g., drone, water, vehicles).
    - >-
      AI location search & scoring: blends map/imagery, public photos, location
      marketplaces, and proprietary database to propose 5–15 viable locations
      ranked by “Shootability Score.”
    - >-
      Sun/shadow + weather windows: computes sun path, shadow lengths
      (terrain/building occlusion), and forecast to suggest 2–3 optimal time
      windows per location with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Access & permits: highlights permit authority, fees, lead times,
      parking/load-in, drone/tide/park rules, restroom options, ADA/access
      notes, and contact links.
    - >-
      Schedule optimizer: orders locations and shots by light/weather windows
      and travel time; proposes A/B backup schedule based on forecast scenarios.
    - >-
      Deliverables: shareable link and PDF location pack (maps, references,
      windows, access notes, risk flags), calendar/ICS export, mobile checklist
      for on-site use.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    End-to-end AI that finds shootable locations and auto-builds a
    light-and-weather-aware schedule in minutes—cutting scouting time by ~80%,
    reducing reshoot risk, and delivering a client-ready location pack with
    backups.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving “Shootability Score” trained on real post-shoot
    outcomes and on-site verification data, combined with city-specific
    permit/access playbooks and marketplace partnerships—creating a data moat
    and workflow lock-in competitors lack.
  customerSegments:

    You’re a commercial photographer or producer who needs the right locations
    and natural light—without losing days to scouting.
  problem: >-
    Scouting eats days, access is uncertain, and light/weather are
    unpredictable—risking missed shots, overtime, and reshoots. You should be
    behind the camera, not buried in maps and forecasts.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of crewed shoot days. Built by producers, our AI
    analyzes terrain, access, sun paths, and micro‑weather to deliver vetted,
    shoot‑ready locations with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Share your brief and dates. 2) Receive a location pack with maps, access
    notes, permits, sun positions, weather windows, backups, and a realistic
    schedule. 3) Confirm picks, lock the plan, and shoot.
  callToAction: Upload your brief to get a free sample location pack within 24 hours.
  success: >-
    Arrive confident: access cleared, permits in hand, the sun where you need
    it, a tight schedule with backups, happy clients, and an on‑time, on‑budget
    wrap.
  failure: >-
    Keep gambling on flat light, locked gates, blown call times, budget creep,
    and last‑minute scrambles.
