    Rapidly generates photoreal concept sheets from prompts, sketches, or
    competitor callouts for early-stage exploration.
  targetUsers:
    - Industrial/product designers
    - Startups without in-house design
    - Agencies in pitch phase
  triggers:
    - Prompt/sketch upload
    - New category exploration request
  inputs:
    - Rough sketches or prompts
    - Functional and size constraints

    - Stability AI SDXL + ControlNet (Replicate/ComfyUI)
    - OpenAI for prompt synthesis
    - Photoshop API (remove/extend)
    - Figma API for layouts
  outputs:
    - Concept sheet PDFs (3–12 options)
    - High-res PNGs per angle
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per concept set (e.g., 6/12/24)'
    - Iteration credits add-on
    - Sprint weekly rate

  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage concept visualization is slow and costly: 1–3 days to produce
      photoreal concept sheets per direction using KeyShot/Blender or external
      contractors ($500–$2,000 per round).
    - >-
      Designers struggle to iterate across multiple directions quickly;
      stakeholder alignment suffers when only 2–3 polished options can be shown
      per review.
    - >-
      Existing AI image tools (Midjourney, SD) lack multi-view consistency, CMF
      realism, and brand/competitor-aware controls needed for industrial design
      workflows.
    - >-
      Agencies and in-house teams face IP risk and data privacy concerns with
      public AI tools (unclear training data provenance; no private
      fine-tuning).
    - >-
      Toolchain fragmentation: sketches in Procreate, moodboards in Miro, CAD in
      Fusion/SolidWorks, rendering in KeyShot; handoffs add 0.5–1 day per
      iteration.
    - >-
      Visual exploration rarely accounts for manufacturability cues (part lines,
      fasteners, draft angles), causing rework later.
    - >-
      Leadership needs measurable progress (variants explored, rationale) but AI
      outputs lack traceability (prompts, references, and lineage).
  solution:
    - >-
      Sketch-to-sheet pipeline: upload pencil/marker sketch or rough CAD
      screenshot; generate 3–12 consistent multi-view photoreal concepts in
      under 10 minutes.
    - >-
      Competitor-aware generation: paste product URLs/images; system extracts
      proportions, archetypes, and CMF cues; outputs differentiated yet
      recognizable alternatives with control over similarity (0–100%).
    - >-
      Brand DNA locks: enforce color/material palettes, logo placement regions,
      and signature design languages to stay on-brand or explore near-brand.
    - >-
      Manufacturability overlays: optional part-line suggestions, draft-angle
      shading hints, and fastener placeholders to reduce later rework.
    - >-
      Traceable concept lineage: every sheet includes references, prompts,
      parameters, and comparison thumbnails for stakeholder review and
      compliance.
    - >-
      Private models and asset vault: enterprise tenants fine-tune on
      proprietary archives; zero training on public data by default; per-tenant
      isolation.
    - >-
      One-click sheet composer: auto-layout with callouts, multiple angles,
      scale bars, material swatches, and SKU notes ready for PDF export or
      Keynote/Slides.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Photoreal, multi-view concept sheets from prompts, sketches, or competitor
    callouts in minutes—with brand/style controls, traceable lineage, and
    enterprise-grade IP safety.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, rights-cleared dataset and multi-view consistency engine
    tuned for industrial design, combined with enterprise-grade
    privacy/fine-tuning and sheet-level traceability; early partnerships with
    top agencies and design schools create distribution and data network effects
    that generalist AI image tools lack.

    Upload inputs, set style/CMF and constraints, review AI-generated boards,
    then refine or export the strongest directions.
  callToAction: Generate your first concept sheet free.
  success: >-
    Present multiple polished directions same day, align stakeholders early, and
    advance to prototypes with clarity and confidence.
  failure: >-
    Lost time on throwaway renders, missed deadlines, eroded trust, and
    competitors defining the brief first.
