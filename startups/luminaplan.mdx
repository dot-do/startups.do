leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Project-driven, lumpy demand tied to construction cycles causes chronic
      overstocking of finished goods while still missing long-lead components
      (drivers, LEDs, optics).
    - >-
      Forecasts are built in spreadsheets or basic ERP modules, yielding high
      error (often 35–60% MAPE at SKU level) and poor service levels (<90%
      OTIF).
    - >-
      Disconnected data: CRM pipeline, distributor POS, and ERP order history
      are siloed; planners can’t reliably translate projects/specs into
      time-phased demand.
    - >-
      Long and variable supplier lead times (8–26+ weeks) and MOQ/price-break
      constraints create cash tied up in the wrong inventory and frequent
      expedites.
    - >-
      Complex, option-rich BOMs (finish, lumen packages, controls) complicate
      multi-level MRP and capacity loading across fabrication, paint, assembly,
      and test.
    - >-
      Seasonality (construction calendars, school/municipal cycles) and macro
      indicators (ABI, permits) aren’t systematically reflected in planning.
    - >-
      High cost of stockouts (lost project awards, penalties) and expediting
      (air freight, overtime) is opaque; no closed-loop learning from misses.
    - >-
      Existing APS/MRP tools are generic or expensive to implement, lacking
      lighting-specific patterns, lead-time risks, and channel dynamics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: Connect ERP (orders, inventory, BOM/routings),
      CRM/pipeline, distributor POS/EDI, supplier lead-time/OTD, and external
      indicators (ABI, building permits, seasonality).
    - >-
      AI demand sensing: Forecast at SKU x customer/channel x week; blend
      project probabilities from CRM with history, promos, and macro signals;
      scenario-ready (win/loss likelihoods, schedule shifts).
    - >-
      Lighting-aware MRP: Multi-level BOM explosion with dynamic safety stock by
      service level, MOQ/EOQ and price breaks, supplier calendars, and
      stochastic lead times.
    - >-
      Finite capacity and WIP plans: Load key work centers, generate feasible
      start/complete dates, sequence rules (paint color batching), and simulate
      overtime/outsourcing trade-offs.
    - >-
      PO and production recommendations: Ranked buy/build proposals with ROI
      impact (stockout risk vs carrying cost), ready to push back to ERP/EDI
      with approvals.
    - >-
      Exception management: Explainable alerts on demand deltas, constrained
      parts, schedule risks, and supplier slippage; daily replanning cadence.
    - >-
      Governance & adoption: Workflow, audit trails, role-based access, and
      plan-actual variance learning loops.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Lighting-specific AI that turns order history, CRM pipeline, and seasonality
    into SKU-week forecasts and executable MRP and WIP plans—reducing inventory
    15–30%, cutting expedites 20–40%, and lifting OTIF to 95%+ within 2–3
    quarters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized planning IP for lighting: pre-trained demand features tied to
    construction cycles and project pipelines; BOM intelligence for lighting
    options and alternates; and a library of ERP/EDI integrations common in the
    segment, enabling faster time-to-value (pilot to production in 8–12 weeks)
    than horizontal APS tools.

    Ops, planning, and supply‑chain leaders at Commercial, Industrial, and
    Institutional Lighting Fixture manufacturers (NAICS 335132) who need
    dependable demand and material plans to ship on time without excess
    inventory.
  problem: >-
    External: project‑driven, high‑mix demand and long‑lead components make ERP
    MRP guesses wrong. Internal: constant firefighting, expedites, and strained
    sales–ops trust. Philosophical: you shouldn’t have to choose between service
    level and working capital.

    volatility. Our AI fuses order history, CRM pipeline, and seasonality to
    produce probabilistic forecasts and executable MRP buys and WIP plans. Built
    by manufacturing planning experts and integrates with common ERPs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP and CRM data. 2) Calibrate models by family and BOM
    attributes. 3) Review weekly forecasts with confidence bands and recommended
    POs/MOs. 4) Approve and sync to ERP. 5) Monitor accuracy and continuously
    improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and run a no‑risk pilot on your last 24 months of
    data.
  success: >-
    Reliable promise dates, higher on‑time delivery, fewer expedites, healthier
    inventory turns, stable schedules, and freed working capital across your
    lighting portfolio.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing demand, missing dates, overbuying long‑lead parts, writing off
    obsolete stock, burning cash, and eroding customer trust.
