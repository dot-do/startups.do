  problem:
    - >-
      Manual damage detection at check-in is error-prone and inconsistent,
      causing 20–50% revenue leakage on legitimate damage (internal interviews
      and ARA benchmarks suggest 0.5–2.0% of rental revenue is lost to
      unbilled/underdocumented damage).
    - >-
      Creating a claim packet (photos, annotations, rate-card estimate, customer
      comms, e-sign, invoice) takes 20–45 minutes of counter/inside sales time
      per incident, delaying asset turnaround and cash collection.
    - >-
      Disputes and chargebacks succeed due to weak documentation (missing time
      stamps, poor photo quality, no itemized estimate, no chain-of-custody).
    - >-
      Branch staff struggle to map observed damage to consistent rate-card
      items/labor hours, leading to undercharging and inconsistent customer
      experience.
    - >-
      Lack of integration between photo capture, rental management systems
      (RMS), e-sign, and invoicing forces duplicate data entry and introduces
      errors.
    - >-
      Managers lack visibility into damage trends (by asset class, customer,
      branch) and cannot proactively reduce incidents or optimize rate cards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision compares check-out vs. check-in photos to detect cracks,
      dents, bends, missing parts, excessive wear, fluid leaks, and abnormal
      dirt levels; outputs labeled findings with confidence scores and location
      markup.
    - >-
      Automated estimate builder maps findings to configurable rate-card items
      (parts, labor hours, shop supplies, cleaning fees) and applies rules
      (waivers, caps, wear-and-tear exclusions).
    - >-
      One-click claim packet: time-stamped photos, annotations, estimate,
      terms/waiver references, signature fields, and invoice stub; sends via
      e-sign and posts to RMS.
    - >-
      Dispute-ready evidence chain: EXIF capture, geo/time stamps, image hash
      ledger, staff attribution, and change audit trail.
    - >-
      Integrations: push/pull jobs, contracts, assets, and customers from
      leading RMS; optional capture via mobile app or ingest via email/API from
      existing photo workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review to approve/edit AI findings; branch-friendly UI
      with keyboard shortcuts; escalation to claims lead for thresholds over X
      dollars.
    - >-
      Analytics: branch/customer/asset-class damage incidence, recovery rate,
      average claim size, time-to-cash, false-positive/negative rates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover more legitimate damage revenue with less effort: AI flags damage
    from check-in photos, auto-builds an itemized estimate from your rate card,
    and compiles a legally sound claim packet for e-sign and invoicing in under
    5 minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset of rental-specific damage images and outcomes
    linked to asset classes and rate-card mappings, plus deep RMS integrations
    and a claims workflow optimized for rental operations (chain-of-custody,
    e-sign, and invoicing). This data+workflow moat improves detection accuracy
    and claim success over time, which general-purpose CV tools or e-sign
    vendors cannot easily replicate.
