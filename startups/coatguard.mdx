  problem:
    - >-
      Eroded margins from inconsistent list pricing and discounting across
      thousands of SKUs, customer segments, and branches (typical 100–300 bps
      margin leakage).
    - >-
      Contract leakage: customer-specific pricing, rebate tiers, and geographic
      restrictions are frequently violated during quoting, causing clawbacks and
      audit risks.
    - >-
      Sales reps lack real-time guardrails and price guidance inside ERP/CPQ;
      reliance on spreadsheets/email slows quotes and increases overrides.
    - >-
      Customers and reps can’t see why prices move; lack of a transparent margin
      waterfall hurts trust and increases pushback and churn.
    - >-
      Raw material volatility (e.g., TiO2, resins, solvents), freight, and FX
      shifts aren’t consistently translated into timely list updates and
      guidance.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, rebates, freight, indices) makes it hard to run
      price experiments, measure lift, and standardize governance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Price optimization models tuned for coatings categories (architectural,
      industrial, marine, sundries) to set list/floor/target/ stretch by segment
      and branch.
    - >-
      Real-time quote guidance embedded in ERP/CPQ with contract guardrails (min
      margin, price/discount fences, geography, pack-size rules, approved
      product substitutions).
    - >-
      Transparent margin waterfall showing base price, raw material indices
      impact, freight, rebates, customer discounts, and approvals so reps and
      customers understand changes.
    - >-
      Automated list maintenance: simulate impacts of index moves and freight
      surcharges; auto-propose updates with roll-out plans by branch/segment.
    - >-
      Rebate and accrual-aware net margin computation at the line and deal level
      to prevent over-discounting and tier mismanagement.
    - >-
      A/B price experiments and sandboxing to prove lift before broad rollouts;
      weekly governance cadences with exception reporting.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box connectors for Epicor Prophet 21, Infor SX.e/Eclipse,
      Microsoft Dynamics 365, NetSuite, and common CPQ tools.
    - >-
      Change management toolkit: playbooks, pricing policies, enablement
      content, and scorecards to drive adoption and sustain gains.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI pricing and contract guardrails purpose-built for coatings distributors:
    optimize list and deal prices, enforce contract rules at quote-time, and
    explain every price with a margin waterfall—lifting margins 100–250 bps
    while cutting quote time and compliance risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization for coatings distribution: pre-mapped
    commodity/index impacts to SKU families, rebate-aware net margin modeling,
    and a customer-facing margin waterfall that turns pricing changes into a
    trust-builder. Proprietary dispersion/guardrail rules and benchmarks allow
    fast time-to-value and demonstrably lower override rates versus horizontal
    pricing tools.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-market paint, varnish, and supplies merchant wholesalers ($50M–$1B
      revenue; 50–500 employees).

      customer-specific pricing/contract structures.
    - >-
      Distribution divisions of manufacturers with merchant wholesale operations
      needing pricing discipline.

      CFO/Finance, COO, IT/ERP Lead, Regional Sales Managers.
  channels:

      account-based marketing (top 200 accounts by revenue/complexity).
    - >-
      Partnerships with ERP VARs/integrators (Epicor P21, Infor, Dynamics,
      NetSuite) with referral/reseller agreements and co-marketing.
    - >-
      Industry associations and events: American Coatings Show/Conference,
      American Coatings Association (ACA), NAW, STAFDA; sponsor sessions on
      pricing governance.

      days” and “Contract guardrails for coatings distributors,” plus ROI
      calculators.
    - >-
      Customer reference program: 60–90 day pilots with measurable KPIs; publish
      case studies and host practitioner roundtables.
    - >-
      Digital: LinkedIn ABM, targeted email to pricing/finance/sales leaders,
      retargeting from content downloads; integrate G2/Peer reviews for social
      proof.

    Pricing leaders and sales teams at Paint, Varnish, and Supplies merchant
    wholesalers who must quote fast, win profitable deals, and stay compliant
    with complex customer contracts.
  problem: >-
    External: Raw-material volatility, thousands of SKUs, regional tiers, and
    contract exceptions cause price drift and margin leakage. Internal: Reps
    lack confidence, approvals stall, and finance can’t explain margin swings.
    Philosophical: Pricing should be fair, consistent, and explainable—to you
    and your customers.
  guide: >-
    We specialize in NAICS 424950 wholesale pricing. Our AI optimizes price
    lists, enforces contract guardrails during quoting, and explains every
    change with a clear margin waterfall (list →
    discounts/rebates/freight/tint/terms → pocket margin). We help distributors
    standardize logic, speed quoting, and protect margins without disrupting
    existing workflows.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect: Sync ERP/CPQ data, contracts, and historical quotes. 2)
    Calibrate: Set guardrails, price corridors, and targets with sales
    leadership. 3) Deploy: Activate optimized price lists and in-quote checks;
    review margin waterfall and iterate weekly. Agreement: keep current
    approvals, no rip-and-replace, transparent reasoning, pilot by region or
    product family.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a pricing assessment and 30-day pilot. Transitional:
    Download the guardrails checklist and a sample margin-waterfall report.
  success: >-
    Consistent, explainable pricing; faster quotes with fewer overrides; higher
    realized margins; confident reps; stronger contract compliance; better win
    rates and customer trust.
  failure: >-
    Avoid margin erosion from ad-hoc discounts, non-compliant quotes and
    chargebacks, stalled approvals, lost deals to race-to-the-bottom pricing,
    and price changes you can’t defend.
