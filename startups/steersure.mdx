  problem:
    - >-
      PPAP/APQP packs are manual and error-prone, taking 40–120 engineer hours
      per submission and causing launch delays when OEMs reject for
      inconsistencies.
    - >-
      FMEA, Control Plan, Process Flow, MSA, Capability, Material Certs, and
      Dimensional results are siloed across Excel, APIS IQ-FMEA, Minitab,
      CMM/ballooning tools, and ERP/PLM—making cross-referencing tedious.
    - >-
      OEM-specific templates (GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Honda, VW, BMW,
      Mercedes, Hyundai-Kia, etc.) vary frequently; suppliers struggle to keep
      up and map data correctly to each format.
    - >-
      Special characteristics (CC/SC) markings, reaction plans, detection
      rankings, and capability thresholds often mismatch across PFMEA/Control
      Plan/Dimensional sheets, leading to rework.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced APQP/PPAP talent increases cycle times and
      dependence on costly consultants.
    - >-
      Version control and traceability across engineering changes (ECR/ECO) and
      APQP gates are weak, jeopardizing IATF 16949 and AIAG-VDA compliance.
    - >-
      Dimensional and material certification evidence (ballooned drawings, CMM,
      heat lots) are not reliably linked to PSW and part submission levels.
    - >-
      MSA (gage R&R, stability, linearity) and capability studies (Cpk/Ppk) are
      inconsistently calculated and documented, risking audit findings and OEM
      rejections.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize inputs (Excel, CSV, APIS IQ-FMEA XML, Minitab
      outputs, PDF/scan of material certs, CMM/ballooning data, CAD-derived
      characteristic lists).
    - >-
      OEM template library with up-to-date PSW, Control Plan, PFMEA, MSA,
      Capability, Dimensional formats for major automakers and common Tier-1
      customer templates.
    - >-
      AI cross-check engine encoding AIAG-VDA/APQP rules and steering/suspension
      domain logic: aligns SC/CC markings, severity/detection controls, reaction
      plans, and capability thresholds across documents.
    - >-
      Auto-synthesis: derives Control Plan operations and checks from PFMEA
      functions/failure modes/controls; proposes detection/occurrence ranks
      based on measurement capability; flags missing MSAs for CCs.
    - >-
      Built-in calculators: MSA (GRR, bias, linearity, stability), capability
      (Cpk/Ppk, normality checks), sampling plans, with parameterized OEM
      thresholds.
    - >-
      Dimensional evidence builder: imports ballooned drawings/CMM data, links
      each critical dimension to PFMEA and Control Plan characteristics, and
      auto-populates Dimensional Result reports.
    - >-
      Workflow, approvals, and e-signatures with audit trails; versioning tied
      to APQP gates and ECRs; PSW auto-generation.
    - >-
      Integrations: PLM (Teamcenter, Windchill), ERP/MES (SAP, QAD, Plex), FMEA
      tools (APIS, Minitab Workspace), metrology (Hexagon PC-DMIS, ZEISS
      CALYPSO), eQMS (ETQ, MasterControl).
    - >-
      Security-by-design: tenant isolation, SOC 2/ISO 27001 roadmap, SSO/SAML,
      detailed access controls per project/customer.
    - >-
      Submission readiness scoring: checks completeness vs. PPAP Level 1–5,
      highlights gaps with estimated time-to-close.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Assemble OEM-ready PPAP packs 5–10x faster with a domain-trained AI and
    rules engine that auto-maps PFMEA, Control Plan, MSA, Capability, Material
    Certs, and Dimensional evidence into the right templates, cross-checks for
    inconsistencies, and raises first-time-right acceptance to
    95%+—purpose-built for steering and suspension supply chains.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific rule engine and OEM template mappings tuned for steering and
    suspension, trained on thousands of real PPAP artifacts; rapid no-code
    template onboarding; tight dimensional-to-characteristic linkage that
    general QMS or FMEA tools lack; early partnerships with APQP consultants and
    select OEM supplier quality teams that accelerate acceptance and template
    updates.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Supplier Quality Managers, Quality Engineers, and Manufacturing Engineers at
    Tier 1/2 steering and suspension component manufacturers (except springs)
    who must deliver PPAP/APQP packs to multiple OEMs, fast and
    right‑first‑time.
  problem: >-
    External: Every OEM/plant has different, shifting PPAP templates and rules.
    Internal: Pulling Control Plans, PFMEAs, MSAs, capability studies, material
    certs, and dimensional results from scattered systems is manual and
    error‑prone, causing mismatches and revisions. Philosophical: Engineers
    should improve processes, not chase paperwork. Stakes: Rejected submissions
    delay SOP, trigger 8Ds/chargebacks, and harm supplier scorecards.
  guide: >-
    We understand launch and audit pressure and built an AI assembler tailored
    to steering/suspension that maps, validates, and cross‑checks PPAP/APQP
    elements against OEM‑specific templates so your packs meet requirements the
    first time.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload drawings/BOM/routings and import CP, PFMEA, MSA, capability,
    material, and dimensional data; select OEM and submission level. 2) AI
    assembles the pack, cross‑checks linkages (special characteristics flowdown,
    gage R&R thresholds, capability criteria, revision sync), and flags gaps. 3)
    Review and resolve in‑app, then export OEM‑specific forms with e‑sign,
    history, and version control; optional PLM/MES/ERP integration.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot with a current program.
    Transitional: Download the PPAP readiness checklist and sample OEM export.
  success: >-
    Consistent, audit‑ready PPAPs that pass on first submission; faster
    launches; less prep and rework; clean traceability across
    CP–PFMEA–MSA–capability–material–dimensional; standardized OEM templates;
    preserved know‑how and easy updates for ECNs.
  failure: >-
    Without it: copy‑paste chaos, missed requirements, late launches, costly
    expedites and 8Ds, burned‑out teams, damaged scorecards, and lost future
    awards.
