leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High spoilage: 20–35% of stems discarded weekly due to over-ordering and
      poor demand visibility
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts on fast movers and holiday spikes (e.g., Valentine’s,
      Mother’s Day) causing missed sales and customer churn
    - >-
      Manual ordering based on gut feel; owners spend 4–8 hours/week reviewing
      sales and building POs
    - >-
      Seasonality, local events, and weather swings make demand volatile and
      hard to predict
    - >-
      Supplier lead-time variability and minimum order quantities complicate
      replenishment
    - >-
      Limited analytics in typical florist POS systems; data lives in
      spreadsheets, not actionable
    - >-
      Multi-location shops struggle to coordinate inventory, substitutions, and
      transfers
  solution:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations to leading florist POS/e-commerce; ingest 12–24
      months of sales, waste, and event data
    - >-
      AI forecasting at stem and bouquet-recipe level with holiday uplift,
      temperature/rain effects, and local events
    - >-
      Automated purchase suggestions: optimal quantities by supplier, honoring
      MOQs, delivery days, and lead times
    - >-
      Substitution logic: recommend alternative stems by color palette/texture
      when primary SKUs constrained
    - >-
      “Approve & send” POs via email/EDI to wholesalers; track confirmations,
      backorders, and fill-rate
    - Waste and stockout analytics with weekly ROI reporting to quantify savings
    - >-
      Multi-store balancing: suggest transfers between locations to avoid
      last-minute wholesaler runs
    - >-
      What-if simulator: set target service level and budget constraints to see
      inventory and margin impact
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce floral waste 20–30% and stockouts 25–40% within 60 days by turning
    your POS data, local weather, holidays, and events into SKU-level forecasts
    and one-click purchase orders tailored to supplier lead times and
    perishability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Network effects from cross-shop floral demand and waste patterns,
    proprietary perishability and holiday-uplift models, and deep supplier
    integrations (PO-to-confirmation data) that improve accuracy and
    recommendations over time—difficult for new entrants to replicate without
    scale.
