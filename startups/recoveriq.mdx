  problem:
    - >-
      Carriers miss 10–25% of eligible subrogation opportunities due to manual
      triage, inconsistent documentation, and siloed data, resulting in 0.5–1.5
      points of loss ratio leakage on targeted lines (personal/commercial auto,
      property, workers’ comp third-party).
    - >-
      Subro cycle times are long (60–180 days to first demand), causing evidence
      staleness, statute-of-limitations/notice violations, and lower recovery
      rates.
    - >-
      Demand packages vary in quality; lack of legal citations, incomplete
      evidence, and missing itemization reduce acceptance rates and push cases
      into costly arbitration/litigation.
    - >-
      Adjusters and subro specialists spend 30–90 minutes per claim scanning
      notes/photos/reports to assess subro potential, reducing throughput and
      increasing backlog.
    - >-
      Integration gaps with core systems (Guidewire, Duck Creek) and external
      data sources (police reports, telematics, ISO ClaimSearch) limit timely,
      high-confidence identification.
    - >-
      Outsourced recovery vendors often charge 15–25% contingency fees and focus
      on high-dollar cases, leaving mid/low-dollar recoveries unaddressed.
    - >-
      Compliance risk from inconsistent tracking of state-specific statutes of
      limitation and municipal notice requirements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-source claim data (FNOL, loss notes, adjuster diaries,
      estimates, photos, telematics, police/fire reports, weather, ISO
      ClaimSearch) via APIs/ETL.
    - >-
      AI scoring model flags subrogation potential (e.g., adverse liability,
      product failure, contractor negligence, municipal liability, cargo spills)
      with explainable drivers and confidence thresholds.
    - >-
      Opportunity classification by line and doctrine (e.g., rear-end
      negligence, dram shop, defective appliance, construction negligence,
      bailment) and identification of target entity
      (carrier/self-insured/municipality/manufacturer).
    - >-
      Automated drafting of demand packages: facts, liability theory, damages
      breakdown (ACV, depreciation, salvage, rental/loss-of-use, deductible),
      attachments, arbitration readiness, and jurisdiction-specific cites and
      notice requirements.
    - >-
      Deadline engine tracks statutes of limitation and municipal notice
      windows; automated reminders/escalations.
    - >-
      Delivery via EDI/email/portal to at-fault carriers or self-insureds;
      optional arbitration filing package for Arbitration Forums.
    - >-
      Closed-loop outcomes capture (accept/deny/partial, paid amount, cycle
      time) to continually improve detection and drafting quality.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase net recoveries 15–40% and cut time-to-demand by 50–70% by
    automatically detecting subrogation opportunities and generating
    jurisdiction-aware demand packages with evidence, legal basis, and
    deadlines—seamlessly integrated into existing claim workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from outcomes across multiple carriers (with strict
    data segregation and optional federated learning) combined with a maintained
    statute/notice engine and arbitration-ready templates; plus certified
    core-system accelerators that reduce time-to-value to weeks instead of
    months.
