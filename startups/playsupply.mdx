leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers face volatile, media-driven demand spikes (movie/TV/game
      releases, viral TikTok/YouTube trends) that make seasonal planning and
      promotion forecasting error-prone.
    - >-
      Long and variable lead times (60–150 days from Asia; Lunar New Year
      shutdowns; port congestion) make reordering windows tight, causing
      stockouts or overbuys.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-based forecasting and ERP MRP rules cannot handle SKU
      proliferation (10k–100k SKUs), case-pack/MOQ constraints, or multi-DC
      allocation efficiently.
    - >-
      Low visibility into retailer promo calendars and sell-through signals
      leads to misaligned inventory and missed Q4 sales.
    - >-
      New product launches and short product lifecycles make history-based
      models alone unreliable; planners lack fast, defensible analog modeling.
    - >-
      Inventory carrying costs are high (financing, storage, obsolescence risk),
      yet service levels lag; leadership lacks clear ROI attribution for
      inventory decisions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, WMS, EDI 850/852/855, spreadsheets) leads to delays
      and errors in purchase orders and allocations.
    - >-
      Planners spend excessive time building reports, following up vendors, and
      creating POs; limited bandwidth to analyze exceptions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly AI forecasts at SKU-DC level with explicit seasonality, promo
      uplift, and event/media signals baked in.
    - >-
      Auto-replenishment engine that generates draft POs meeting vendor MOQs,
      case-packs, container constraints, and lead times; pushes to ERP/EDI for
      approval.
    - >-
      New product forecasting via analogs and attribute models (license, brand,
      age range, price band) and controlled launch curves.
    - >-
      Segmented service-level and safety-stock optimization (ABC-XYZ) to balance
      turns and fill rates by category/channel.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow and alerts (stockout risk, late vendor,
      overstock/obsolescence, cannibalization) prioritized by margin impact.
    - >-
      Lead time intelligence incorporating vendor calendars (e.g., Lunar New
      Year), historical variability, and freight/transit updates.
    - >-
      Promo/calendar integration: import retailer promos, releases, and
      conventions (Toy Fair, GAMA) to shape demand.
    - >-
      Performance dashboard: forecast accuracy (WAPE/MAPE/bias), service levels,
      turns, GMROI, working capital, and ROI from accepted proposals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase on-time availability and reduce inventory with toy/hobby-tuned
    weekly SKU-location forecasts and auto-generated, ERP-ready draft POs that
    account for seasonality, promotions, lead times, MOQs/case-packs, and
    media-driven demand—delivering 10–20% inventory reduction and 2–5 point
    service level improvement within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific models and datasets (toy/hobby seasonality,
    licensing/media signals, vendor calendars) plus prebuilt ERP/EDI connectors
    deliver faster time-to-value; an anonymized, opt-in trend graph across
    distributors creates early warning on rising SKUs/categories; proven
    pilot-to-ROI playbook reduces buyer risk.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Inventory and purchasing leaders at toy & hobby goods wholesalers who want
    the right SKUs in the right DC each week without overstock or stockouts.
  problem: >-
    Demand is spiky and seasonal; promotions, new releases, and long/variable
    lead times make spreadsheets unreliable. Teams firefight stockouts and clear
    post-season excess. It shouldn’t require guesswork to keep shelves full and
    cash flowing.
  guide: >-
    We understand toy and hobby volatility. Our AI is built for this category,
    modeling seasonality, promotions, lifecycles, and lead times to produce
    weekly SKU-location forecasts and reorder proposals—backed by clear accuracy
    KPIs and hands-on onboarding.
  plan: >-
    3 steps: (1) Connect data—orders/POS, inventory, catalog, supplier
    calendars, lead times. (2) Calibrate—service levels, constraints, and
    accuracy validation on your history. (3) Automate—weekly forecasts, draft
    POs, and risk alerts for review in your ERP.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30‑minute demo. Transitional: Request a pilot using your
    data to see sample forecasts and draft POs.
  success: >-
    Higher in-stock rates on hot and seasonal SKUs, lower excess, faster turns,
    fewer expedites, and confident buys ahead of releases and promotions—saving
    hours each week and creating a calm, data-driven replenishment rhythm.
  failure: >-
    Missed sales on hot items, cash tied in dead stock after season, emergency
    air freight, retailer penalties, and a burned-out planning team.
