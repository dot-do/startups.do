    Forecast demand and recommend buy/sell price bands by SKU/grade/region using
    market, weather, and seasonality signals.
  targetUsers:
    - Pricing Managers
    - Traders
    - GMs
  triggers:
    - Weekly pricing cycle
    - Large market move (>2%)
    - Inventory threshold breach

    - Python (Prophet/NeuralProphet/sktime)
    - USDA AMS API
    - Nasdaq Data Link/Quandl for futures
    - Open-Meteo/NOAA API
    - Google Sheets/Excel

  risks:
    - Data quality gaps or SKU redefinitions break models
    - >-
      Regulatory/antitrust risk if using competitor pricing—use only public
      benchmarks/internal data
    - Overfitting during volatile periods
  dependencies:
    - Access to ERP/CRM data (read-only)
    - API keys for USDA/futures/FX/weather
    - Pricing approval workflow/thresholds
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile commodity prices (weather, crop progress, logistics) cause
      inconsistent margins and missed opportunities for wholesalers trading
      cotton, tobacco, wool, hides, hay, oilseeds and other raw materials.
    - >-
      Pricing is set with spreadsheets and broker intel, lacking
      SKU/grade/region granularity; bid/offer bands are too wide or misaligned
      with basis and seasonality.
    - >-
      Forecasting demand by SKU/grade is ad hoc; weekly MAPE commonly 25–40%,
      driving overstock/stockouts and excess working capital.
    - >-
      Inventory turns are low (3–6x/year typical) and aged lots (>120 days) rise
      after shocks; quality/grade mismatches increase markdowns.
    - >-
      Sales and procurement decisions are siloed; no closed-loop learning to
      align quotes, replenishment, and hedging to realized outcomes.
    - >-
      Limited use of external signals (weather, NDVI, futures/basis, freight,
      macro indices) in day-to-day pricing decisions.
    - >-
      ERP/OMS systems (SAP B1, Dynamics, NetSuite) lack embedded predictive
      pricing; integration friction blocks adoption of analytics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Forecasting engine: weekly/daily demand forecasts at SKU/grade/region with
      explainability (key drivers: weather anomalies, NDVI, futures/basis,
      seasonality, customer order cadence).
    - >-
      Dynamic price banding: recommended bid/offer ranges by SKU/grade/region
      with confidence intervals; auto-updated as signals shift; guardrails for
      min margin and inventory age.
    - >-
      Basis and futures alignment: integrate ICE/CME where applicable; compute
      optimal basis adjustments; alert on spread anomalies and hedge
      suggestions.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware pricing: incorporate current stock, lot age/quality,
      storage costs; recommend allocation and markdowns for slow movers.
    - >-
      Tender/contract optimizer: suggest price ladders, volume breaks, and
      validity windows; simulate win probability and margin outcomes.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: stress test weather shocks, freight spikes, and
      currency moves on demand and price bands; set automated triggers.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest wins/losses, realized prices, and customer
      feedback to recalibrate models weekly.
    - >-
      Integrations: prebuilt connectors for NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics 365,
      SAP Business One; EDI/S3/REST ingestion; SSO (Okta/Azure AD).
    - >-
      Operationalization: pricing API and web app for quoting; alerts via
      email/Teams/Slack; audit trails and versioned recommendations.
    - >-
      Pilot playbook: 8–12 week pilot covering 3–5 key commodities and 2–3
      regions; success criteria pre-agreed (MAPE, margin, hit rate).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SKU/grade/region-level demand forecasts and dynamic buy/sell price bands
    that fuse market, weather, and seasonality signals—embedded into your
    quoting and purchasing workflows—to lift margin 150–300 bps, reduce DIO
    10–20 days, and increase bid win rate 5–10% within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models that incorporate agricultural grade/quality
    attributes and regional basis, combined with a growing anonymized network
    dataset of quote outcomes and realized prices—powering superior
    price-response curves and faster learning than generic pricing tools. Deep
    ERP/EDI integrations reduce time-to-value and lock in daily operational use.
