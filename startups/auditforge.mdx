leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Buyers (enterprise/government) increasingly require SBOMs and license
      attestations; today generating accurate SBOMs takes 2–10 days per release
      and delays deals.
    - >-
      Legal risk from misclassified or unknown licenses (e.g., copyleft
      contamination) leads to costly rework; typical license reviews consume 2–8
      hours per release/product line.
    - >-
      Dependency vulnerabilities accumulate; 30–60% of repos carry known CVEs
      and remediation backlogs, with MTTR often >60 days.
    - >-
      Existing SCA/SBOM tools create noise and lack actionability; developers
      ignore alerts without auto-fix PRs and clear policy guidance.
    - >-
      SBOM quality varies (incomplete transitive deps, missing binaries,
      inconsistent SPDX/CycloneDX fields); auditors reject low-fidelity
      artifacts.
    - >-
      Multiple ecosystems (containers, OS packages, polyglot repos) and build
      systems complicate unified policy enforcement and reporting.
    - >-
      Leadership needs audit-ready evidence for SOC2/ISO/FedRAMP; current
      evidence collection is manual and brittle.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (e.g., US federal procurement SBOM expectations, EU
      CRA trajectory, FDA guidance) creates urgent but unclear requirements.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click SBOM generation in SPDX and CycloneDX across source, containers,
      and OS packages; includes transitive and binary discovery.
    - >-
      License detection with a policy engine (allow/deny/conditional), risk
      scoring, and human-in-the-loop workflows for edge cases.
    - >-
      Unified vulnerability intelligence (OSV, NVD, distro feeds) with VEX
      ingestion to reduce noise and prioritize exploitable issues.
    - >-
      AI-generated remediation PRs that safely upgrade dependencies, suggest
      license-friendly alternatives, and include test/CI hints; impact
      simulation and rollback.
    - >-
      Policy-as-code gates in CI/CD (GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps/Bitbucket) with
      signed attestations (Sigstore) and SLSA provenance.
    - >-
      Audit-ready dashboards and exports (PDF/JSON/CSV/API) mapped to
      SOC2/ISO/NIST SSDF/FedRAMP controls; evidence trails per release.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From code to compliant SBOMs and auto-remediation PRs in minutes. Cut
    license and vulnerability risk by 60–80% while preserving developer
    velocity; generate signed, audit-ready artifacts on every build.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    High-accuracy AI remediation PRs and license interpretations trained on a
    proprietary corpus of curated diffs and adjudicated license edge cases,
    combined with policy-as-code and signed attestations that slot directly into
    developer workflows. Network effects from cross-organization policy
    templates and feedback loops improve fix quality and acceptance over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Software publishers (NAICS 513210): CTOs, engineering leaders, and
    security/compliance owners who must ship secure, license-compliant software
    without slowing releases.
  problem: >-
    External: Exploding OSS dependencies, risky/unclear licenses, CVEs, customer
    audits, and SBOM mandates.

    Internal: Manual reviews drain engineering time and create release anxiety.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between speed and compliance.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know release trains stall when security questionnaires and
    license reviews pile up.

    Authority: AI-driven analysis, native SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs,
    OpenChain-aligned workflows, and deep VCS/CI integrations to make compliance
    continuous.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Link repos/CI and container registries.

    2) Assess: Auto-generate SBOMs, flag risky licenses/CVEs, map obligations.

    3) Remediate: Auto-propose fixes with pull requests, enforce policy gates,
    and export attestations/reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a trial or book a demo.

    Transitional: Get the OSS Compliance Checklist and a sample SBOM risk
    report.
  success: >-
    Continuous, audit-ready SBOMs for every build; faster releases with
    policy-backed guardrails; reduced legal exposure; shorter time-to-remediate;
    cleaner dependency trees; smoother security reviews and enterprise deals.
  failure: >-
    Missed license obligations, stalled releases, failed audits, breach exposure
    from unresolved CVEs, costly rework and legal disputes, and lost revenue due
    to blocked deals.

    title: 'AI SBOM, License & OSS Compliance Auditor'
    subtitle: >-
      Generate SBOMs, flag risky licenses and vulnerabilities, and ship PR-based
      fixes—built for Software Publishers (NAICS 513210).
    ctaText: Start Free Scan
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - 'Manual SBOM creation is slow, inconsistent, and quickly out of date.'
    - >-
      Risky licenses slip into releases and trigger legal exposure late in the
      cycle.
    - Vulnerability alerts are noisy and lack context or prioritization.
    - Fixing dependency issues across repos is tedious and error-prone.
    - >-
      Customers and auditors demand SBOMs and evidence you can’t produce
      instantly.
    - Release gates fail late due to hidden transitive dependencies.
    - Engineering time is lost chasing CVEs instead of shipping features.
  solution:
    - Automated SBOMs per commit and release in SPDX and CycloneDX formats.
    - License detection with policy enforcement and clear remediation guidance.
    - Exploitability-aware vulnerability triage with contextual prioritization.
    - >-
      One-click, AI-generated pull requests to upgrade, replace, or patch risky
      packages.
    - Continuous monitoring with CI/CD gates to prevent risky releases.
    - >-
      Audit-ready reports and change history for customers and compliance
      reviews.
    - >-
      Native integrations with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Jira,
      and Slack.
  features:
    - >-
      Instant SBOM generation (SPDX/CycloneDX) from source, lockfiles, and
      containers.
    - >-
      License policy enforcement (allow/deny), obligations, and compatibility
      checks.
    - >-
      AI PRs for safe upgrades, version pinning, and package replacements with
      summaries.
    - 'Prioritized alerts using severity, reachability, and exploit signals.'
    - Signed SBOMs and attestations for supply chain trust.
    - CI/CD quality gates with break/notify modes and per-project thresholds.
    - 'Policy-as-code with exceptions, approvals, and expiry windows.'
    - >-
      Language coverage: npm, PyPI, Maven/Gradle, Go, RubyGems, NuGet, Cargo,
      and more.
    - 'Repo, monorepo, and multi-repo workspace support.'
    - Private registries and vendored dependencies scanning.
    - 'Exportable, audit-ready reports (JSON, PDF) with evidence and timelines.'
    - SaaS or private cloud deployment options.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect your repos and registries (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure
      DevOps).
    - Import or define your license and vulnerability policies.
    - 'Auto-generate SBOMs on every commit, PR, and release.'
    - Review prioritized issues with clear license obligations and CVE impact.
    - Approve AI-generated PRs to upgrade or replace risky dependencies.
    - Enforce gates in CI/CD and publish SBOMs to customers as needed.
    - Export audit-ready reports and maintain evidence automatically.
    - Monitor continuously—auto-close resolved items and track drift.
