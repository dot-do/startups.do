  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned harvest delays from wet fields reduce harvestable days by 10–30%
      in wet seasons, causing grain losses, quality downgrades, and higher
      drying costs.
    - >-
      Getting machinery stuck costs $1,000–$5,000 per incident in tow fees, lost
      time, and damage, with safety risks for operators.
    - >-
      Soil compaction from ill-timed traffic can reduce next-season yields by
      5–20% and raise fuel use by 10–15%, yet timing decisions are made with
      coarse weather data and gut feel.
    - >-
      Existing tools show rainfall/soil moisture but don’t translate them into
      machine-specific trafficability or safe entry paths and windows.
    - >-
      Large farms and custom harvesters need coordinated routing for combines,
      grain carts, and trucks; current workflows are ad-hoc and fragmented
      across apps.
    - >-
      Regulatory and sustainability pressures (e.g., EU soil protection) demand
      documented risk mitigation and compaction-avoidance practices, which most
      farms cannot evidence today.
  solution:
    - >-
      High-resolution trafficability and compaction risk maps (10–20 m grid)
      updated daily, using fused SAR/optical satellite, weather forecasts, soil
      maps, DEM, drainage layers, and optional in-field sensors.
    - >-
      Machine-aware recommendations: model bearing capacity vs. axle loads, tire
      pressure, tracks vs. tires, and grain cart weights to output go/no-go
      guidance by machine.
    - >-
      Dynamic path planning: suggest low-risk field entry points, headland
      approaches, grain cart staging, and in-field haul routes to minimize wet
      spots and slopes.
    - >-
      Time-window optimization: 0–120 hour forecast of safe operating windows
      per field, confidence scored, with alerts as conditions change.
    - >-
      Integrations and data import/export: John Deere Operations Center, Climate
      FieldView, Trimble, AgLeader; shapefile/GeoJSON/KML support;
      mobile/offline use.
    - >-
      Evidence and audit: exportable logs of decisions, routes, and risk levels
      for insurers, sustainability programs, and regulatory compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Make every harvest day count. TerraTrac AI predicts field trafficability and
    compaction risk by machine and load, pinpoints low-risk entry points and
    paths, and recommends optimal time windows—reducing stuck events by up to
    50%, increasing safe harvestable days by 10–20%, and protecting yields next
    season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, proprietary dataset that pairs machine telemetry and
    outcomes with SAR/weather/soil features, enabling physics-informed ML models
    that outperform generic moisture maps. OEM integrations and insurer
    partnerships create switching costs and evidence-based incentives. Regional
    calibration and routing tuned by real-world stuck-event logs become hard to
    replicate.
