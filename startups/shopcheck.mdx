    submission to the design team.
  targetUsers:
    - Detailers
    - PMs/Submittal Coordinators
    - QC
  triggers:
    - New shop/erection drawing batch ready
  inputs:
    - Shop/erection drawings (PDF/DWG)
    - IFC/Tekla/SDS2 model (optional)
    - Contract drawings and specs
  steps:
    - 'Extract member marks, sizes, holes, camber, coatings from shops'
    - Compare against contract docs and spec tolerances
    - Flag mismatches and missing data; create comment log
    - Generate submittal cover sheet and compile package
    - Export BCF issues (optional)
  tools:
    - PDF/DWG parsers
    - IFC compare (BCF)
    - LLM for spec rule checks
    - Excel/Docx automation
  outputs:
    - Variance report and comment register
    - Marked-up shop PDFs
    - Submittal cover sheet
  pricingModel:
    - Per sheet or per tonnage tier
    - Per submittal package

  problem:
    - >-
      High return rate on shop/erection drawing submittals (commonly 20–40%
      returned with comments) causes schedule slippage and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Manual pre-checks are inconsistent and slow; shortage of senior checkers
      increases risk of missed nonconformances.
    - >-
      Frequent spec/code mismatches (e.g., bolt grade/finish, weld size,
      connection type, camber, tolerances) lead to RFIs, rework, and
      backcharges.
    - >-
      Multiple revisions per submittal (2–3 cycles typical) add 1–3 weeks to
      approval; field impacts can cost $5k–$50k per issue.
    - >-
      Contract docs are complex and fragmented (plans, specs, addenda, RFIs,
      ASIs); extracting applicable requirements is error-prone.
    - >-
      GC/Owner pressure to compress schedules reduces QA thoroughness; quality
      risk shifts downstream to erectors and fabricators.
    - >-
      Existing tools focus on coordination/clash, not on contract compliance of
      shop drawings; rule-based macros are brittle across projects.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or auto-ingest contract documents (plans, specs, general notes,
      addenda, RFIs/ASIs) and shop/erection drawings/models.
    - >-
      AI parses drawings/specs and runs a structural QA rule set (steel +
      precast) to detect mismatches, omissions, and tolerance issues.
    - >-
      Generates a pre-check report with location-based annotations, confidence
      scores, and suggested corrections/RFIs.
    - >-
      Revision-aware differencing to highlight new/unchanged items, reducing
      re-review time.
    - >-
      Integrations with Tekla, SDS/2, Revit/IFC, Bluebeam, Procore/Autodesk
      Construction Cloud for seamless workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI for checkers; learn-from-feedback to adapt to
      firm- and project-specific standards.
    - >-
      Configurable rule packs by material (AISC/AWS/ASTM for steel; PCI/ACI/ASTM
      for precast) and by project spec overrides.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered pre-check that reads your shop/erection drawings and compares
    them to project contract docs, flagging nonconformances before submission.
    Target outcomes: 30–50% fewer review comments, 3–5 days faster approval
    cycle per package, and 5–10x ROI through avoided RFIs, rework, and
    expediting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized AI trained on structural steel and precast submittals with a
    growing, proprietary corpus of annotated reviewer comments and outcomes;
    deep CAD/BIM integrations that fit existing Tekla/SDS/2/Bluebeam workflows;
    and configurable rule packs aligned to AISC/PCI practices—creating a
    feedback loop that quickly adapts to each firm and project, and is hard for
    generalist tools to replicate.

  character: >-
    Structural steel and precast concrete contractors (PMs, detailers,
    fabricators) who want shop/erection drawings approved on the first pass.
  problem: >-
    Manual pre-checks miss spec/scope conflicts, leading to RFIs, rework,
    resubmittals, delays, back-charges, and margin erosion under schedule
    pressure.
  guide: >-
    We get the cost of a redlined submittal. Our AI aligns with AISC/PCI
    practices and your project’s contract docs, highlighting nonconformance with
    clear citations. Built with input from fabricators/detailers, with optional
    PE review and private, secure processing.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload contract docs (plans/specs/addenda/RFIs/ASIs/models) and your
    shop/erection drawings.

    2) Run AI pre-check: flags nonconformance/missing info/clashes and cites
    exact spec/plan pages; outputs a fix list.

    3) Resolve items; export a clean transmittal and exception log for the
    design team.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on one package or book a 20-minute demo. Transitional:
    Download the pre-check checklist and sample report.
  success: >-
    Higher first-pass approvals, fewer RFIs, tighter schedules, protected
    fab/erection windows, documented quality, stronger GC/EOR relationships, and
    steadier cash flow.
  failure: >-
    Without it: missed conflicts, resubmittals, idle crews, blown float,
    back-charges, LD exposure, and strained designer/GC trust.
