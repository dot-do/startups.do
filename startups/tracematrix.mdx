  problem:
    - >-
      Protocol authoring is slow and manual: 60–70% of V&V engineer time is
      spent writing and formatting test protocols rather than testing.
    - >-
      Traceability gaps: linking requirements, risk controls (ISO 14971),
      standards (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, IEC 62304), and tests is error-prone;
      15–30% of protocols require rework after RA/QA review.
    - >-
      Change management pain: requirement changes trigger days of manual impact
      analysis across protocols and trace matrices.
    - >-
      Result summarization delays: V&V Summary Reports (VSRs) and deviation
      roll-ups can take 2–6 weeks post-execution, delaying releases and audits.
    - >-
      Variant explosion: many SKUs/options force duplicative protocol edits;
      parameterization is weak in current tools.
    - >-
      Siloed tools: ALM (Jama/DOORS/Polarion), QMS/EDMS, and test management
      (TestRail/Xray) are not integrated, leading to duplicated data and
      inconsistent evidence.
    - >-
      Audit readiness risk: audit trails, e-signatures, and data integrity
      (ALCOA+) often require manual collation, increasing observation risk.
    - >-
      Inconsistent quality: protocol style and acceptance criteria vary by
      author and team; onboarding new test engineers is slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted protocol generation from requirements, risk controls, and
      standards—consistent templates with parameterized steps, expected results,
      and acceptance criteria.
    - >-
      Automated traceability matrices linking URS/SRS/HRS, risk mitigations,
      tests, defects, and standards; continuous sync with ALM.
    - >-
      Change impact analysis to identify affected protocols/steps when
      requirements or risks change; one-click update proposals.
    - >-
      Execution result ingestion from test management tools and instrument logs;
      AI summarization into VSRs with pass/fail by requirement, deviations,
      trends, and CAPA links.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workflows with redlines, comments, and Part
      11-compliant e-signatures and audit trails.
    - >-
      Secure on-prem/VPC deployment options; data never leaves customer
      boundary; SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001-aligned controls.
    - >-
      Pre-validated “CSV package” (intended use, requirements/specs, risk
      assessment, IQ/OQ/PQ, validation plan/report) to shorten internal
      validation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-ready, fully traceable V&V test protocols and auto-summarize
    executed results/deviations in hours instead of weeks—integrated with your
    ALM/QMS, compliant with 21 CFR Part 11/Annex 11 and GxP data integrity.
    Reduce protocol authoring time by 60–80%, cut rework by 50%, and accelerate
    audit prep by 2–4 weeks per release.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary instrument-focused test ontology and template library built with
    reference OEMs, combined with pre-validated CSV packages and deep ALM/QMS
    integrations that competitors lack. Early auditor-accepted outputs and
    benchmarked ROI data establish credibility. Human-in-the-loop guardrails and
    deterministic templates minimize AI risk in regulated contexts.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: QA/RA leaders, V&V managers, systems/test engineers at analytical
      laboratory instrument OEMs (e.g., chromatography, mass spectrometry,
      spectroscopy, particle analysis, balances, rheometers).
    - >-
      Regulated device segments: IVD/clinical diagnostics instrument
      manufacturers with higher CSV rigor (ISO 13485, 21 CFR 820).
    - >-
      Mid-market and growth-stage instrument startups (50–1000 employees)
      needing faster, audit-ready V&V without large documentation teams.
    - >-
      Contract design/manufacturing organizations (ODM/CDMO) building
      instruments for OEMs.
    - Validation services/CSV consultancies serving the above manufacturers.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct enterprise sales to QA/RA/V&V leadership at top 200 analytical/IVD
      OEMs via targeted ABM.
    - >-
      Partnerships with ALM/QMS vendors and CSV consultancies (co-sell,
      implementation, and validation services).
    - >-
      Industry conferences and publications: Pittcon, SLAS, Analytica, AACC;
      webinars and whitepapers on AI in CSV/Part 11 compliance.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    V&V managers, QA/RA leads, and test engineers at analytical laboratory
    instrument manufacturers who need faster, fully traceable, audit-ready
    protocols and results summaries.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual protocol authoring and results collation are slow,
    inconsistent, and hard to trace to URS, FRS, risks, and design outputs;
    IQ/OQ/PQ packages take too long; deviations live in scattered spreadsheets.

    Internal: Teams worry about audit gaps, version confusion, and duplicated
    effort instead of actual testing.

    Philosophical: Engineers should validate instrument performance, not wrestle
    with paperwork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of regulated releases, change control,
    and inspections.

    Authority: Our AI-driven templates align with GxP, ISO 17025, ISO 13485, and
    21 CFR Part 11 expectations, embed traceability matrices, and follow ALCOA+
    data integrity with audit trails and versioning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sources: requirements and risks (e.g., DOORS, Jama, Polarion),
    design outputs, and your templates.

    2) Auto-generate: risk-based, traceable protocols (IQ/OQ/PQ or custom V&V)
    with step-level criteria and data capture fields.

    3) Execute and capture: ingest results, evidence, and deviations from your
    tools or structured forms.

    4) Summarize and export: consolidated results/deviation reports, coverage
    metrics, and e-signature–ready packages to your eQMS, LIMS, or ALM.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and scope a pilot on one instrument
    release.

    Transitional: Download a sample protocol and summary pack plus a Part
    11–ready documentation checklist.
  success: >-
    - End-to-end traceability from URS/FRS and risks to test steps, results, and
    deviations.

    - Consistent, audit-ready IQ/OQ/PQ or V&V packages.

    - Shorter V&V cycles and fewer document defects.

    - Real-time coverage and deviation insights for go/no-go decisions.

    - Confident audits, smoother submissions, and faster releases.
  failure: >-
    - Audit findings and CAPAs from missing traceability or data integrity
    issues.

    - Slip dates caused by document rework and version chaos.

    - Unclear deviations leading to repeated investigations.

    - Burnout from manual paperwork and weekend crunches.
