  title: Tax Document OCR & Data Extraction to Workpapers
  description: >-
    Parse W-2, 1099, 1098, K-1 and other tax docs to structured fields mapped to
    import templates for common tax software.
  targetUsers:
    - CPA/EA tax firms
    - Outsourced workpaper teams
  triggers:
    - Document upload to portal
    - Batch processing window
  inputs:
    - Scanned or native PDFs (W-2/1099/1098/K-1)
    - Tax software import specs (Drake/ProConnect/UltraTax)
  steps:
    - OCR and key-value extraction per form type
    - Normalize payer/payee names and EIN/TIN
    - Validate totals and cross-field checks
    - Map to software-specific CSV/XML templates
    - Route low-confidence fields to reviewer
    - Export workpapers and mapping logs
  tools:
    - 'OCR (AWS Textract, Google DocAI)'
    - LLM for field normalization
    - Form-specific parsers
    - Spreadsheet/CSV generator
  outputs:
    - Per-form structured JSON/CSV
    - Software import files
    - Exception queue and confidence report
  pricingModel:
    - Per-document ($0.50–$3)
    - 'Volume bundle (per 1,000 pages)'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.3
  risks:
    - OCR errors on low-quality scans
    - Mapping mismatches with software versions
    - PII handling and retention policies
  dependencies:
    - Access to up-to-date import templates
    - Secure file storage
    - Client consent for automated parsing
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual keying of tax documents (W-2, 1099, 1098, K-1) into workpapers
      costs 8–20 minutes per return and drives staffing spikes during a 12–14
      week season.
    - >-
      Error-prone data entry (1–3% field error rates) leads to notices, rework,
      and potential penalties; firms lack systematic confidence scoring and
      validation.
    - >-
      Legacy scan-and-import tools are vendor-locked, limited in document
      coverage, or require pristine scans; modern clients submit phone photos,
      mixed PDFs, and state variants.
    - >-
      Firms need outputs mapped to multiple tax software import templates
      (Lacerte, ProSeries, UltraTax, CCH Axcess/ProSystem fx, Drake, TaxSlayer
      Pro), but mapping is fragmented and brittle.
    - >-
      Security and compliance requirements (FTC Safeguards Rule, IRS Pub 4557,
      SOC 2) make DIY OCR risky; few tools offer audit trails, retention
      controls, and US-only data processing.
    - >-
      K-1s and consolidated 1099s are complex, multi-page, and semi-structured;
      most tools underperform without human review workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Document intake via API, portal, email, and watch-folder with automatic
      classification of common tax forms (W-2, 1099 family, 1098, K-1, 5498,
      state equivalents).
    - >-
      Form-specific parsers combining OCR + layout models + tax-aware rules;
      confidence scoring at field and document level.
    - >-
      Validation layer: SSN/EIN formats, payer/payee cross-checks, totals
      reconciliation (e.g., W-2 boxes sum checks), and mismatch flags vs
      prior-year data (optional).
    - >-
      Direct export mapped to import templates for Lacerte, ProSeries, UltraTax,
      CCH Axcess/ProSystem fx, Drake, TaxSlayer Pro; CSV/JSON and Excel
      workpaper outputs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: route low-confidence fields/pages to reviewer queue;
      side-by-side source view; single-keystroke corrections feed continuous
      learning.
    - >-
      Security-by-design: SOC 2 roadmap, FTC Safeguards alignment, encryption at
      rest/in transit, audit logs, role-based access, IP allowlists, US/EU data
      residency options, configurable retention.
    - >-
      Seasonal autoscaling and burst capacity; SLA-backed processing under 60
      seconds/doc at p95 during peak weeks.
    - >-
      Admin analytics: throughput, auto-accept rate, error rates by form/field,
      per-client ROI reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    High-accuracy, compliance-grade tax document OCR with built-in
    classification, validation, and direct mapping to major tax software import
    templates, delivering 70–90% time savings per return, measurable confidence
    scores, and season-ready autoscaling.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built tax document parsers and up-to-date import mappings across
    multiple tax suites, reinforced by proprietary labeled datasets and a
    calibrated human-in-the-loop engine that maintains high accuracy on complex
    forms (K-1, consolidated 1099) while meeting FTC Safeguards/SOC 2
    requirements and peak-season SLAs.

    Tax preparation firms (NAICS 541213) who want cleaner, faster workpapers by
    converting client tax documents into structured, ready-to-import data.
  problem: >-
    External: Client documents arrive as mixed PDFs/scans; manual entry into
    workpapers is slow and error-prone. Internal: Busy-season backlog and review
    anxiety. Philosophical: Tax pros should advise clients, not retype forms.
  guide: >-
    We understand busy-season chaos and review pressure. Built by tax tech
    veterans and ML engineers, our security-first service (encryption, audit
    logs, role-based access) parses W-2, 1099, 1098, K-1, and more, mapping
    fields to common tax software import templates.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload or forward client docs (portal, email, API). 2) AI extracts and
    validates fields, flags anomalies, and assembles workpaper-ready exports. 3)
    Import into your tax software and review with an audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 15-minute demo or start a pilot on a real client set.
    Transitional: Download sample mappings and try the sandbox.
  success: >-
    Returns move faster with fewer errors; staff time shifts from data entry to
    review and advisory; consistent, audit-ready workpapers; smoother reviews;
    happier clients; scalable busy season.
  failure: >-
    Manual keying persists, causing bottlenecks, rework, missed fields, staff
    burnout, compliance risk, and client dissatisfaction.
