  problem:
    - >-
      Commercial banks still track many financial and affirmative/negative
      covenants manually (spreadsheets, email ticklers), creating 5–15% missed
      or late covenant tests per year in mid-market/CRE portfolios.
    - >-
      Borrower financials arrive in unstructured formats (PDFs, emails, portal
      uploads); staff spend 30–90 minutes per package to extract figures and
      recalculate ratios, increasing cycle time and error risk.
    - >-
      Breaches or reporting misses are sometimes detected weeks late, elevating
      credit risk and delaying remediation; median time-to-detect can exceed
      15–30 days for smaller/regional banks.
    - >-
      Waiver/notice drafting is repetitive but legally sensitive; analysts and
      counsel spend 2–4 hours per letter, driving high non-value-add workload
      and outside counsel fees.
    - >-
      Existing LMS/LOS covenant modules capture due dates and ratios but do not
      reliably parse covenant language variations or auto-draft tailored waiver
      language with correct conditions and fees.
    - >-
      Regulatory expectations (SR 11-7 model risk, GLBA/FFIEC, auditability)
      make deploying AI risky without explainability, controls, and validation
      artifacts.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (LMS, DMS, email, borrower portals) create gaps in
      audit trails and SLA adherence for covenant testing and notifications.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest borrower documents from email, SFTP, DMS, or borrower portal; parse
      PDFs/Excels and normalize financials with human-in-the-loop validation.
    - >-
      Map each facility’s covenant package to a standardized covenant ontology;
      extract thresholds, calculation methods, cure periods, and reporting
      calendars.
    - >-
      Continuously test covenants (financial and non-financial) upon receipt of
      data or at scheduled intervals; flag breaches/misses with confidence
      scores and evidence pins.
    - >-
      Trigger workflow for analysts/approvers; provide explainable calculations
      and redlines to the underlying covenant text.
    - >-
      Auto-draft waiver/notice letters based on breach type, facility, and
      policy—populate dates, fees, conditions precedent, and cure periods—ready
      for counsel/credit officer review.
    - >-
      Sync status and documents back to LMS/LOS and DMS; maintain immutable
      audit logs for regulators and internal audit.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards: upcoming covenant tests, past-due items, breach
      trends, waiver cycle times, and operational KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Bank-grade AI that continuously monitors borrower covenants across C&I/CRE
    portfolios, detects breaches/misses with explainable evidence, and
    auto-drafts waiver/notice letters in minutes—reducing detection time by
    >80%, documentation effort by >70%, and audit risk, with SR 11-7-aligned
    controls and seamless LMS integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A bank-validated covenant ontology and waiver template library co-developed
    with leading regional banks and counsel, plus an SR 11-7-aligned model
    governance package and out-of-the-box integrations to major LMS/LOS
    platforms—reducing procurement friction and time-to-value relative to
    generic AI or horizontal doc tools.

    Commercial bank credit officers, portfolio managers, and loan operations
    leaders who must ensure covenant compliance and timely notices across
    growing loan portfolios.
  problem: >-
    External: Covenant monitoring is manual and scattered across LOS,
    spreadsheets, and document vaults—breaches surface late and letters take
    hours to draft. Internal: Teams worry they’ll miss something and dread
    exams. Philosophical: Accountability in banking shouldn’t rely on heroics or
    manual busywork.

    We’ve sat in credit and risk and know the stakes. Our banking-grade AI—built
    for NAICS 522110, SOC 2, explainable, and audit-ready—monitors covenants
    continuously and drafts waiver/notice letters for review.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect secure data feeds (loan docs, core/LOS, financials). 2) Configure
    covenant rules; AI parses, tracks, and detects breaches/misses. 3) Receive
    alerts and pre-drafted letters; review, e-sign, and archive with a full
    audit trail.

  success: >-
    Real-time covenant coverage, faster resolutions, consistent and compliant
    correspondence, cleaner exams, recovered fee income, stronger borrower
    relationships, and 40–60% time saved per account.
  failure: >-
    Missed breaches lead to exam findings, fee leakage, last-minute scrambles,
    inconsistent letters, higher legal exposure, staff burnout, and reputational
    damage.
