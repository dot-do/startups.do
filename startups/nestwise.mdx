  problem:
    - >-
      High material waste: typical scrap rates of 8–18% in die-cut paper
      converting due to non-optimal impositions, poor nesting, and inconsistent
      grain/tolerance handling.
    - >-
      Manual, slow layout creation: 20–90 minutes per job spent by
      prepress/engineering to create and verify nests, with high rework when
      machine limits are misinterpreted.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge risk: experienced planners/die makers retiring; process
      knowledge is not codified, leading to variability in yields and quality.
    - >-
      Machine constraints not consistently enforced: clamp margins,
      nicks/bridges, gripper clearances, die chase limits, and
      stripping/blanking rules often discovered at press, causing make-ready
      waste and delays.
    - >-
      Inaccurate quotes and margin leakage: quoting uses average yields rather
      than job-specific nests, causing underbids and overruns.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain: CAD dielines (CF2/DXF/PDF), ERP/MES, CAM for
      die-making, and press settings are not integrated, causing duplicate entry
      and errors.
    - >-
      Carbon and sustainability pressure: customers request verifiable
      reductions in waste and CO2 per order; current reporting is manual and
      unreliable.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven nesting/imposition engine that optimizes for yield, make-ready
      time, and press constraints, with explicit parameters for grain direction,
      nicks, gutters, clamps, gripper, die chase, stripping and blanking.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware simulation: validates every candidate layout against
      machine-specific capabilities and die-making limits to avoid on-press
      surprises.
    - >-
      Quoting integration: one-click yield estimation from dieline to quote with
      confidence intervals and risk flags; pushes item-level yields and scrap to
      ERP.
    - >-
      Auto-generation of production assets: exports die layout files (CF2/DXF),
      press mark patterns, nick/bridge placements, and reports for die room and
      press crews.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: model improves from accepted/rejected layouts and
      post-job data (actual scrap, make-ready time) to tune for each
      plant/machine.
    - >-
      Deployment options: cloud with on-prem agent for firewall-protected file
      shares; full on-prem optional for ITAR/IP-sensitive customers.
    - >-
      Implementation plan: 2-week discovery (constraints, libraries), 2–4 week
      pilot on 50–100 historical jobs, then go-live on new work with
      side-by-side validation for 4 weeks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce paper waste and make-ready time with AI-optimized die-cut impositions
    that respect grain, tolerances, and machine limits—validated automatically
    and delivered to your existing CAD/ERP workflow in minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Machine-specific AI models trained on anonymized historical jobs and
    validated with OEM press constraints, producing layouts that balance yield
    and make-ready time better than generic nesting tools; tight ERP/CAD
    integrations that make results immediately usable in quoting and production.

  character: >-
    Production planners and operations leaders at converted paper product
    manufacturers (NAICS 322299) who must hit yield, quality, and on-time
    targets across die-cut jobs.
  problem: >-
    Manual imposition/nesting wastes stock and time: grain and flute direction
    are violated, tolerances get missed, and machine limits (chase size, clamp
    margins, rule height) are ignored—creating overruns and schedule risk. It’s
    frustrating to watch costs rise just to keep quality. No one should have to
    choose between waste and compliance.
  guide: >-
    We understand die-cut realities—grain, caliper, kerf, nicks/bridges, bleed,
    and press/slotter constraints—and we speak your CAD/CAM. Our AI-driven
    optimizer, built with manufacturing engineering know-how, aligns layouts to
    your machines and standards.
  plan: >-
    1) Share dielines, stock specs, and machine constraints. 2) Receive
    optimized impositions/nests with grain and tolerance compliance plus yield
    and setup KPIs. 3) Approve and export cut files, step-and-repeat, and job
    tickets into your CAD/CAM/ERP. Agreement: confidentiality protected; start
    with a low-risk pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a pilot optimization. Transitional: Request a sample layout
    analysis for a current job.
  success: >-
    Higher yield per sheet, faster changeovers, fewer re-cuts, verified
    grain/tolerance compliance, predictable schedules, lower material spend, and
    a smaller waste footprint.
  failure: >-
    Continuing to burn paper, bust tolerances, jam machines, miss ship dates,
    and erode margins due to manual, suboptimal nesting.
