leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual note-taking consumes 15–30% of meeting time and yields inconsistent
      minutes; action items are often missed or ambiguous.
    - >-
      Decisions are rarely captured in an auditable format, causing rework and
      accountability gaps; 1 in 4 projects suffers delays due to unclear
      ownership post-meeting.
    - >-
      Follow-ups fall through the cracks when tasks are not synced to the team’s
      systems (Asana/Jira/Planner/Trello), reducing completion rates by 20–35%.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (Meet/Teams/Zoom + Docs + Task app + Email) create
      duplicate work and context switching, costing ~2–4 hours per employee per
      week.
    - >-
      Generic AI note takers focus on transcripts, not decision clarity, task
      owners, or deadlines; admins still spend time editing and chasing updates.
    - >-
      Compliance and privacy concerns (PII, HR/legal meetings) require granular
      redaction, data residency, and audit trails that many tools lack.
    - >-
      Poor speaker diarization and domain jargon reduce accuracy for
      multi-speaker meetings, leading to low trust and low adoption.
    - >-
      Multi-lingual/global teams need reliable summaries in English plus local
      languages to align distributed stakeholders.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click or auto-join capture in Zoom/Teams/Google Meet; or upload
      audio/recordings.
    - >-
      AI pipeline: high-accuracy ASR + speaker diarization + domain-adapted
      models to extract decisions, action items, owners, and due dates;
      confidence scores with human-in-the-loop review when needed.
    - >-
      Smart assignment: resolve assignees via calendar/attendee list; suggest
      due dates based on meeting cadence and workload signals (calendar
      availability).
    - >-
      Sync to systems of record (Asana, Jira, Monday, ClickUp, MS Planner,
      Trello, Salesforce tasks, Outlook/To Do); bi-directional updates to keep
      status current.
    - >-
      Automated follow-ups: nudges in Slack/Teams and email; weekly digest of
      overdue/at-risk items; escalation rules for critical decisions.
    - >-
      Templates and governance: standardized minute templates by meeting type
      (staff, project, QBR, HR), approval workflow, versioning, and decision
      registry with audit logs.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SSO/SAML, RBAC, data residency options, redaction
      of PII, SOC 2 Type II and GDPR alignment; private cloud/VPC deployment for
      regulated orgs.
    - >-
      Analytics: meeting hygiene scores, decision throughput, action item
      completion rates, and time saved; exportable for QBRs and audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, audit-ready minutes and action items delivered within minutes and
    auto-synced to your task systems—so decisions stick and follow-ups get done.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feedback-driven, domain-adapted decision/action extraction model trained
    on admin/ops meeting data plus a governance-first workflow (approval,
    decision registry, audit logs) deeply integrated with enterprise task
    systems—creating a quality, compliance, and workflow moat that generic note
    takers lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
