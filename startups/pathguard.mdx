leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly 3‑week lookaheads are manually built in Excel/PowerPoint, taking
      4–8 hours per week per project and often diverging from the CPM master
      schedule.
    - >-
      Near‑critical paths and cascading risks are missed; typical updates focus
      only on Longest Path, leading to late discovery of slippage (often >2–4
      weeks after first warning signals).
    - >-
      What‑if analysis (resequencing, overtime, added crews) is slow and
      requires expert schedulers; teams rarely test multiple scenarios in OAC
      meetings.
    - >-
      Procurement/submittal lead times, weather risk, and resource conflicts are
      poorly linked to the schedule, causing avoidable outages and idle crews.
    - >-
      Owners and GCs lack objective, early indicators of milestone slip
      probability and can’t quantify risk mitigation ROI in real time.
    - >-
      Schedulers face heavy admin work (XER/MPP cleaning, logic checks, float
      path analysis) instead of higher‑value planning and coordination.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse master schedules (P6 XER/XML, MS Project MPP/XML, Asta) and run
      automated schedule health/risk diagnostics (logic quality, near‑critical
      paths, negative float, out‑of‑sequence).
    - >-
      Generate an actionable 3‑week lookahead aligned to Last Planner practices:
      constraints log, handoffs, needed approvals/submittals, material
      deliveries, and crew plans.
    - >-
      Quantify slip risk for milestones and work packages (probability bands
      over 1–12 weeks) using historical patterns, float consumption,
      near‑critical convergence, resource contention, lead times, and weather
      seasonality.
    - >-
      One‑click what‑if scenarios: resequence activities, apply added
      crews/OT/2nd shift, enforce logic changes, prioritize
      submittals/procurement; compare finish dates, risk deltas, and cost/time
      trade‑offs.
    - >-
      Push actions into field tools (Procore Observations/Tasks, ACC Issues) and
      track closeout; publish weekly OAC meeting packets (PDF/PowerPoint) and
      live dashboards.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from actuals (updates, progress curves, RFIs, delivery
      dates) to recalibrate risk and recommendations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce schedule surprises and admin churn by turning your CPM schedule into
    an action‑ready 3‑week plan with quantified risk and instant
    what‑ifs—integrated with your field workflows (Procore/ACC) in under 2
    weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of labeled schedule histories spanning
    commercial/institutional projects that links planned logic with realized
    outcomes, procurement, and weather—enabling accurate early‑warning risk and
    practical what‑ifs. Deep field integrations convert insights into closed
    actions, not just reports, and our Last Planner‑aligned lookahead generator
    bridges CPM and site execution.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    GC/CM project teams (PMs, supers, schedulers) delivering commercial and
    institutional buildings who want early visibility into slippage and
    reliable, master-aligned 3‑week lookaheads.
  problem: >-
    CPM schedules hide risk until it’s a crisis; manual lookaheads are slow,
    stale, and disconnected from the master. Resequencing, RFIs, and late
    deliveries cascade across trades—causing missed milestones, weekend work,
    LDs, claims, and margin erosion.
  guide: >-
    A construction‑aware AI built with veteran schedulers and supers. We speak
    P6/MSP, read your logic, and translate risk into clear actions your team can
    take before delays spread.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload the master schedule (P6 XER/XML or MSP). 2) Receive risk‑ranked
    slippage alerts, root‑cause drivers, and what‑if impacts. 3) Auto‑generate
    actionable 3‑week lookaheads aligned to the master; export to
    PDF/Excel/Procore.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot on one active project—or book a 20‑minute demo and get a
    complimentary schedule risk scan.
  success: >-
    Proactive control of the schedule; reliable weekly work plans; fewer
    surprises and change orders; less overtime; aligned subs and confident
    owners; milestones met and margins protected.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: scattered lookaheads, cascading delays, weekend work,
    LDs, claims, and shrinking profit.

  problem:
    - 'Master schedules are massive, infrequent, and hide emerging delays.'
    - '3-week lookaheads are manual, inconsistent, and instantly stale.'

    - 'Auto-generate actionable 3-week lookaheads by area, trade, and crew.'
    - 'Flag float erosion, near-critical paths, and milestone exposure.'
    - 'Run what-if scenarios for resequencing, crew levels, and weather impacts.'
    - 'Surface constraints: submittals, inspections, permits, and procurement.'

      Constraint extraction: prerequisites, RFIs, submittals, inspections,
      permits.
    - Procurement tracker for long-lead items with needed-by exposure.
    - 'Milestone protection: gate checks and handoff clarity.'
    - 'Change impact diff: see what moved since last update.'
    - Automated alerts to email/Slack when risk thresholds are crossed.
