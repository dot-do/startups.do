leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      NCR triage is slow and inconsistent across machining, assembly, coating,
      hydrotest, and FAT; average cycle time 10–30 days causes WIP buildup,
      missed ship dates, and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis quality is variable; 5-Why/Fishbone outputs are often
      generic, leading to 15–25% repeat nonconformances within 6–12 months.
    - >-
      Quality knowledge is siloed in PDFs, email threads, and tribal know-how;
      lessons learned are not reused across cells, shifts, or sites.
    - >-
      Manual data wrangling from QMS/ERP/MES/test stands consumes 20–40% of
      quality engineers’ time, limiting preventive improvement work.
    - >-
      CAPA actions are not prioritized by risk/impact; critical
      pressure-containing defects can be under-triaged, increasing safety and
      compliance exposure (API Q1/Q2, ISO 9001).
    - >-
      Suppliers generate a large share of NCRs; inconsistent supplier feedback
      loops delay containment and drive rework costs.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks near-real-time visibility into quality cost drivers (COQ,
      scrap/rework, recurrence), slowing corrective investments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified AI triage engine that ingests NCRs from QMS and correlates with
      ERP/MES/test stand data to auto-classify defect type, criticality, and
      likely source process.
    - >-
      Root-cause inference using a domain-trained causal model and similarity
      search across historical NCRs to suggest most probable causes with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      CAPA recommender library mapped to API Q1/Q2 and ISO 9001, proposing
      containment, corrective, and preventive actions with expected impact and
      effort.
    - >-
      Supplier and machine attribution that highlights recurring patterns by
      vendor, cell, operator, tool, coating line, or test rig.
    - >-
      In-line assistant embedded in QMS NCR/CAPA forms to reduce engineer time
      on narrative, coding, 5-Why, and evidence gathering.
    - >-
      Risk-based prioritization that escalates pressure-containing and
      safety-critical NCRs and flags potential systemic issues across sites.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: tracks CAPA effectiveness and feeds outcomes back
      into the model; federated learning enables cross-site insights with data
      privacy controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut NCR cycle time by 30–50% and reduce repeat nonconformances by 20–40% by
    turning fragmented manufacturing and test data into actionable root-cause
    and CAPA recommendations tailored to oilfield equipment processes and
    API/ISO requirements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific cause/CAPA knowledge graph trained on oilfield
    manufacturing NCRs with federated learning across sites, combined with
