  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs and authorized distributors struggle to attach the right spare kits
      to quotes and work orders, leaving 5–15% aftermarket revenue unrealized.
    - >-
      Cross-referencing part supersessions and equivalents is slow and
      error-prone; outdated or missing mappings drive wrong-part shipments and
      returns (2–5% of order lines).
    - >-
      Service teams lack asset-specific guidance; recommendations are generic
      and ignore serial number, duty cycle, and environment, increasing downtime
      risk and emergency orders.
    - >-
      Obsolescence and slow-moving inventory tie up working capital; 10–20% of
      service inventory often has 12+ months of no movement.
    - >-
      Quoting and order entry are slowed by manual BOM lookups and engineering
      approvals, extending quote cycle times from hours to days.
    - >-
      Upgrade identification is reactive; EOL migrations, safety bulletins, and
      performance upgrades are not systematically surfaced to the right assets
      and accounts.
    - >-
      Installed-base data is fragmented across ERP, EAM/CMMS, PLM, CPQ, and
      spreadsheets; data quality issues (duplicates, legacy part numbers) block
      scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven recommender embedded in CPQ, commerce, and service work order
      flows: asset-specific spare kits, supersession cross-references, and
      upgrade offers based on service history, environment, and criticality.
    - >-
      Domain-specific knowledge graph of parts, BOMs, supersessions, alternates,
      and regulatory/EHS bulletins; continuously updated from PLM, ERP, and OEM
      notices.
    - >-
      Criticality and risk scoring model: prioritizes recommended
      safety-critical spares and lead-time risk items; flags stockout exposure
      and downtime impact.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: tracks accept/decline, outcomes, returns, failures;
      improves recommendations and pricing sensitivity over time.
    - >-
      Decision support and economics: shows ROI, downtime avoided, compatibility
      checks, and warranty implications for upgrades and kit options.
    - >-
      Low-friction integrations: certified connectors for SAP S/4 and ECC, SAP
      CPQ/Commerce, Oracle EBS and Fusion, IFS, Infor, IBM Maximo, ServiceMax,
      Siemens Teamcenter/PLM; batch and API options.
    - >-
      Governance and explainability: audit trail of why a recommendation was
      made, with links to supersession bulletins, engineering changes, and
      service notes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Grow aftermarket parts and upgrades revenue by 5–12%, cut returns and
    wrong-part incidents by 20–40%, and reduce obsolescence by 15–30% with AI
    that recommends the right kits, supersessions, and upgrades for every
    serialized asset, embedded directly in your quoting, service, and commerce
    workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, domain-specific supersession and upgrade knowledge
    graph fed by multi-source OEM bulletins, PLM changes, and real transaction
    outcomes, embedded directly in OEM quoting and service workflows. As
    adoption grows, de-identified outcome data improves precision, creating a
    defensible data network effect and high switching costs. Deep certified
    integrations and upgrade playbooks by asset family further raise barriers to
    entry.

  character: >-
    Aftermarket leaders at oil & gas field machinery OEMs (service, parts,
    reliability) responsible for uptime, customer trust, and profitable
    parts/upgrade revenue across the installed base.
  problem: >-
    They struggle to know the right spares and upgrades per serial
    number—engineering supersessions are complex, data is scattered
    (ERP/PLM/CMMS/field logs), and criticality varies by application—leading to
    stockouts, obsolete inventory, missed upgrades, and costly downtime.
  guide: >-
    Installed-Base Spare Parts & Upgrade Recommender is an AI service tailored
    to NAICS 333132, combining BOM/ECN history, service records, failure modes,
    and operating context to recommend spare kits, cross-reference
    supersessions, and propose risk-based upgrades—secure, explainable, and
    enterprise-ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and define criticality (BOMs, ECNs, service logs, install
    base). 2) Pilot on a target product line with measurable KPIs. 3) Deploy
    recommendations into catalogs, CPQ, e-commerce, and field service, with
    ongoing monitoring and refinement.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute discovery and data readiness review to launch a 4–6
    week pilot.
  success: >-
    Teams quote complete, correct kits; planners cut obsolescence and expedites;
    customers gain uptime; sales capture targeted upgrades; leadership gets
    clear install-base intelligence and predictable aftermarket growth.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams rely on tribal knowledge, ship wrong or obsolete parts,
    pay expedite fees, miss upgrade revenue, and risk customer churn when
    equipment fails at critical moments.
