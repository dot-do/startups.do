  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or generic workforce tools produce crew rosters that miss maritime
      rest, watchkeeping, and qualification rules, causing compliance exposure
      and rework.
    - >-
      Fatigue risk is not quantified; operators lack proactive alerts when
      duty/rest patterns approach unsafe thresholds.
    - >-
      Union CBAs and seniority bidding make schedules complex; late changes due
      to weather, maintenance, and absenteeism drive overtime and missed
      sailings.
    - >-
      Safety managers spend hours assembling audit evidence (duty logs, rest
      records, training/endorsement validity).
    - >-
      Schedulers lack real-time visibility into crew certifications, route
      familiarization, and medical/fit-for-duty constraints.
    - >-
      Public agencies face pressure to reduce cancellations and overtime, but
      have few diagnostics to show improvement or justify staffing levels.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven roster generation that respects maritime duty/rest rules,
      vessel/route qualifications, CBAs, and seniority bidding.
    - >-
      Embedded fatigue risk scoring with circadian and cumulative hours logic;
      configurable thresholds and alerts for planners and supervisors.
    - >-
      Qualification and currency tracking (licenses, endorsements, route
      familiarization, drills, medicals) tied directly to assignability.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test schedule changes, weather disruptions, and
      staffing scenarios with predicted compliance and cost impact.
    - >-
      Automated compliance reports (duty/rest, assignment logs, exception
      justifications) for USCG/Transport Canada and internal audits.
    - >-
      Mobile crew app for schedule visibility, swap requests,
      standby/extra-board availability, and push alerts with rule-aware
      approvals.
    - >-
      Integrations to payroll/timekeeping (e.g., UKG/Kronos, ADP), HRIS, access
      control/T&A, and dispatch; SSO with Okta/Azure AD.
