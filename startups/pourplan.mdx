leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-cost schedule slippage: Large slab and wall pours commonly overrun by
      1–3 hours, driving pump standby ($250–$400/hour) and ready-mix truck idle
      charges ($100–$200/hour) and overtime labor.
    - >-
      Load sequencing and spacing errors: Incorrect truck spacing causes
      cold-joint risk or slump loss; rejected loads can cost $150–$300 per load
      plus disposal and schedule recovery.
    - >-
      Weather and traffic uncertainty: Unanticipated heat, cold, wind, or
      congestion changes placement rates and set times, yet few contractors
      operationalize real-time weather/traffic into pour logistics.
    - >-
      Fragmented planning tools: Foremen and supers rely on spreadsheets,
      whiteboards, radio/SMS, and experience; no specialized tool optimizes pump
      locations, truck slotting, and crew allocation end-to-end.
    - >-
      Coordination overhead: Dispatch with producers, pump vendors, finishers,
      and inspection windows takes hours per pour and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Documentation gaps: As-builts, pour cards, and inspection logs are
      inconsistent, complicating QA/QC and claims. Compliance for hot/cold
      weather concreting (per ACI) is rarely embedded in planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI pour breakdown and sequence: Converts drawings/quantities and site
      constraints into optimal pour segments and order based on placement rates,
      pump reach, site access, and finish requirements.
    - >-
      Pump layout optimizer: Suggests primary/secondary pump positions, boom
      reach verification, outrigger footprints, matting needs, and contingency
      positions; flags crane/powerline conflicts.
    - >-
      Truck slotting engine: Calculates delivery cadence by mix design, travel
      time, batch plant capacity, and target placement rate; issues dynamic slot
      adjustments from live traffic/plant telemetry.
    - >-
      Crew planning: Allocates crews by task (place, vibrate, finish, saw-cut,
      cure, QC/inspection), skill mix, and union rules; projects overtime and
      recommends shift splits.
    - >-
      Weather-aware scheduling: Integrates forecasted temp, wind, RH,
      precipitation, and solar load to recommend start times, admixture guidance
      prompts, bleed/finish windows, and curing plans.
    - >-
      Field execution toolkit: Mobile checklists, pour cards, live dashboards,
      and alerts (SMS/WhatsApp/push) for trucks, pump operators, and finishers;
      automated after-action report.
    - >-
      Integrations: Procore/Autodesk Build/Bluebeam for plans and RFIs,
      ready-mix dispatch (e.g., Command Alkon/Sysdyne/BCMI), traffic
      (Google/HERE), weather (NOAA/DTN), telematics (Geotab).
    - >-
      Compliance and QA/QC: Embedded ACI hot/cold weather concreting checklists,
      slump/temperature sampling cadence, and inspection windows; stores photos,
      test results, and sign-offs.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: Stress-tests pours under different crew sizes, pump
      counts, start times, and mix designs; outputs cost/schedule deltas and
      risk scores.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plan pours in minutes, not hours: AI-optimized pour sequencing, pump
    locations, truck slot schedules, and crew plans that adapt in real time to
    weather and traffic—reducing idle time 20–40%, cutting rejected loads
    10–25%, and improving schedule reliability.
