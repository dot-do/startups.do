leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-severity recall risk from allergen cross-contact or mislabeling in
      mixed-nut/peanut environments; manual checks miss edge cases under time
      pressure.
    - >-
      Siloed data (production schedule, sanitation logs, label specs) prevents
      comprehensive pre-op risk assessment before line start.
    - >-
      Changeovers between allergen sets (e.g., almond to peanut, peanut to
      peanut-free) are complex; validation and verification steps are
      inconsistent across shifts and lines.
    - >-
      Labels change frequently (promotions, suppliers, formulations);
      last-minute swaps aren’t cross-checked against allergen matrices reliably.
    - >-
      Audits (FDA FSMA, SQF/BRCGS) demand objective evidence and 21 CFR Part
      11-compliant records; current paper/digital-hybrid systems are incomplete
      or hard to retrieve.
    - >-
      Pre-op approvals and line clearances are slow and error-prone, causing
      delays or approvals without full verification.
    - >-
      Training drift across shifts leads to inconsistent SOP adherence; CAPAs
      repeat due to weak verification and trending.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of real-time cleaning effectiveness (CIP/OPC) and
      environmental swab trends for allergen residues.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingests production schedules (ERP/MES) and maps each run’s allergen
      profile to prior runs and cleaning requirements (validated matrices).
    - >-
      Pulls/validates sanitation and cleaning verification (CIP parameters, swab
      results, visual inspections, chemical concentrations) to confirm allergen
      removal efficacy before approval.
    - >-
      Automates label verification: cross-checks current label rev/spec
      (Loftware/NiceLabel/PLM) vs formula/allergen matrix, flags mismatches and
      obsolete artwork.
    - >-
      Generates dynamic, product- and line-specific pre-op checklists and
      requires digital approvals with e-signature and time/user stamps.
    - >-
      Provides a real-time risk score and blocks line start until critical
      controls pass; suggests corrective actions and additional verifications if
      risk is high.
    - >-
      Creates complete audit trails and export packs (FSMA Preventive Controls,
      BRCGS/SQF modules) with objective evidence and traceability.
    - >-
      Offers CAPA workflows with trend analysis (recurring failure modes by
      line/shift/product).
    - >-
      Mobile app (online/offline) for operators/QA to capture photos, swab
      results, and complete checklists at the line.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce allergen recall risk and changeover delays by automatically checking
    every run against schedules, sanitation evidence, and labels—then issuing
    audit-ready, 21 CFR Part 11-compliant pre-op approvals. AC4 acts as a
    real-time gatekeeper that prevents starting a run unless cross-contact risks
    are verified and documented.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A pre-validated allergen knowledge graph and changeover matrix specific to
    nut/peanut operations, combined with turnkey integrations to ERP/MES/label
    platforms and audit-ready evidence generation. Backed by an advisory board
    of former SQF/BRCGS auditors and sanitation validation experts, enabling
    faster approvals from auditors and insurers and shorter time-to-value than
    generic QMS tools.
