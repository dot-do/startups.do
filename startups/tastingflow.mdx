  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable walk-in traffic leads to frequent under/overstaffing,
      causing either labor waste or poor guest experiences.
    - >-
      Managers spend 3–6 hours/week manually building schedules in spreadsheets
      with little data support.
    - >-
      Seasonality (harvest, holidays, tourism flows) and weather swings (heat,
      rain, smoke) drive large demand variance that’s hard to anticipate.
    - >-
      Basic booking systems capture reservations but not the true mix of
      reservations vs. walk-ins or day-of cancellations/no-shows.
    - >-
      Labor costs in tasting rooms (often 20–30% of room revenue) are rising;
      overtime and last-minute shift changes inflate costs further.
    - >-
      Compliance constraints (e.g., California meal/rest breaks, split shifts)
      make manual cost optimization error-prone.
    - >-
      No winery-specific forecasting tools exist that combine bookings, weather,
      events, and local tourism indicators to create actionable, compliant
      schedules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integrations pull bookings (e.g., Tock, CellarPass), POS
      check-ins/sales (e.g., Commerce7, WineDirect, Square), historical
      footfall, local events, and weather forecasts.
    - >-
      Hourly demand forecasts at 2–6 week horizons with daily updates and
      same-day nowcasts; target MAPE ≤12–15% on weekly horizons.
    - >-
      Optimization engine converts demand into role-based staffing plans (hosts,
      associates, educators) respecting labor-law constraints, skills, breaks,
      and budgets.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning to simulate weather shifts, club events, promos,
      and capacity limits; auto-recommend adjustments.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts for sudden demand deltas (e.g., group bus arrival,
      weather change) with quick-fill shift suggestions.
    - >-
      Dashboards tracking labor cost % of tasting-room revenue, wait times,
      conversion to club signups, and forecasting accuracy.
    - >-
      API/webhooks to push schedules into common scheduling tools (When I Work,
      7shifts, Homebase, Deputy) or export CSV.
    - >-
      ROI reporting: quantified savings from reduced overtime, avoided
      understaffing, and improved guest throughput/upsell.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Winery-specific AI that predicts hourly tasting room traffic and auto-builds
    compliant, cost-optimized rosters from your bookings, POS, and
    weather—reducing labor costs 8–15% while cutting guest wait times and
    schedule-building time by 75%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    POS traffic, weather, and regional event signals across multiple AVAs, plus
    deep integrations into wine-industry systems (Commerce7, WineDirect, Tock)
