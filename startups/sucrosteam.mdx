  problem:
    - >-
      Beet sugar factories spend 30–50 USD per ton sugar on energy; 60–75% of
      that is steam for evaporation and crystallization. Setpoints for steam
      header splits, effect loading, vacuum, and crystallizer duty are often
      based on heuristics and conservative margins, not data.
    - >-
      Multiple-effect evaporators and crystallizers run below theoretical
      efficiency due to fouling, suboptimal vapor bleed strategies, bottlenecks,
      and variability in juice purity/temperature; operators lack real-time
      guidance to rebalance loads while respecting constraints.
    - >-
      Plants struggle to quantify and sustain savings because of seasonal
      campaigns, changing beet quality, and weather effects; measurement and
      verification (M&V) is rarely rigorous, undermining trust in continuous
      optimization programs.
    - >-
      Existing APC/AI tools are generic, require heavy configuration, or lock
      into OEM/DCS stacks; sugar-specific thermodynamics (boiling point
      elevation, supersaturation, color formation, scaling risk) are not
      embedded, limiting performance and adoption.
    - >-
      Electrical loads (vacuum systems, crystallizer drives, condensate return)
      are not co-optimized with steam, missing 3–8% electricity saving
      potential.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a sugar-thermodynamics–aware advisory engine that recommends steam
      header splits (HP/MP/LP), vapor bleed routing, effect loading, and vacuum
      targets to minimize total energy cost subject to throughput, purity, BPE,
      and fouling constraints.
    - >-
      Crystallization optimizer that sets heat duty targets by pan/crystallizer,
      manages supersaturation bands and seeding strategies, and synchronizes
      vacuum and cooling profiles to reduce steam and power while maintaining
      crystal size distribution (CSD) and color.
    - >-
      Soft sensors for Brix, purity, viscosity, and BPE using plant historian
      data to improve observability of quality constraints without adding
      hardware.
    - >-
      Closed-loop readiness: start with advisory-only (operator confirmation),
      then optional APC layer for automated setpoint moves within guardrails.
    - >-
      M&V module using IPMVP Option C with normalization for beet quality (pol),
      ambient temperature, and throughput; provides baselines, control periods,
      confidence intervals, and guaranteed-savings reports.
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud data pipeline integrating DCS and historians (e.g., OSIsoft
      PI, AVEVA, Ignition), with on-prem edge for low latency and cloud for
      modeling, optimization, and benchmarking.
    - >-
      Operator UX designed for shift handover: ranked advice with rationale,
      constraint heatmaps per effect/crystallizer, and one-click acceptance with
      setpoint write-back permissions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Sugar-specific AI that continuously advises the lowest-energy setpoints for
    evaporation and crystallization—cutting 8–15% steam and 3–8% electricity per
    ton of sugar—while honoring product quality and process safety, with
    auditable M&V and pay-for-performance pricing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A sugar-specialized optimization stack (thermodynamics, supersaturation
    kinetics, anti-scaling heuristics) trained on multi-plant, multi-campaign
    datasets with validated M&V baselines—enabling faster deployment, stronger
    operator trust, and guaranteed, auditable savings that generic APC/AI tools
    or OEM add-ons can’t match.

  character: >-
    Beet sugar factory managers and process engineers who must hit cost, energy,
    and quality targets without risking throughput or crystal quality.
  problem: >-
    External: Rising steam and power costs, CO2 pressure, variable beets, and
    complex multi‑effect evaporators make setpoints hard to choose (steam header
    splits, effect loading, vacuum targets, crystallizer heat duty). Internal:
    Teams are stuck guessing and firefighting across shifts. Philosophical:
    Making sugar shouldn’t waste energy or compromise crystal quality.
  guide: >-
    We understand campaign variability, pan-floor constraints, and the risk of
    boilovers. Our team blends sugar process expertise with industrial AI and
    has delivered measured energy cuts in beet factories. The advisory engine
    learns from your historian/DCS to recommend optimal steam and power use
    while respecting plant limits.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & baseline: Integrate with historian/DCS, validate data, and
    establish current steam/power per ton sugar. 2) Optimize: Deploy AI advisory
    to recommend steam header splits, effect loading, vacuum targets, and
    crystallizer heat duty; deliver setpoint guidance to dashboard or DCS. 3)
    Prove & scale: M&V of savings, operator coaching, and optional closed‑loop
    optimization. Low‑risk: no CAPEX, keep your constraints, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 4–8 week pilot this campaign. Transitional: Request a sample
    savings report and readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    8–15% lower steam per ton sugar, 5–10% lower electricity, steadier pans and
    vacuum, fewer boilovers, reduced molasses losses, maintained or improved
    throughput and purity, lower CO2 intensity, and fast payback within the
    campaign.
  failure: >-
    Continued overspend on steam and power, missed CO2 targets, unstable
    crystallization and off‑spec massecuite, higher molasses losses, unnecessary
    CAPEX, and operators stuck firefighting instead of optimizing.

  problem:
    - >-
      Static setpoints waste energy as slice rate, purity, and ambient
      conditions change.
    - >-
      Evaporator effects are unevenly loaded; header splits aren’t retuned after
      stops or fouling.

      Manual tuning can’t keep up with hourly variability; trade-offs aren’t
      visible in real time.
