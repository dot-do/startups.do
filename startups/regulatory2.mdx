leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented, manual compliance data: Material usage, waste shipments,
      training, exposure records, and production data live in separate systems
      (ERP/MES, spreadsheets, paper binders), making filings slow and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      High regulatory complexity for a niche process: Manufacturers must
      navigate EPA (TRI, RCRA, stormwater), OSHA (lead standard 1910.1025,
      300/300A logs), DOT/PHMSA hazmat registration/records, and state-specific
      rules without dedicated in-house EHS teams.
    - >-
      Costly and unpredictable consultant spend: Many plants rely on external
      consultants for filings/audit prep ($50k–$150k/year/site), with variable
      quality and limited operational visibility.
    - >-
      Audit risk and downtime: Inspections (EPA/OSHA/state) can result in
      findings due to incomplete records or missed thresholds, causing rework,
      potential fines, and production interruptions.
    - >-
      Limited executive visibility: Leadership lacks dashboards tying regulatory
      risk and readiness to production realities (e.g., lead usage, waste
      volumes, exposure trends).
  solution:
    - >-
      Data aggregation: Connect to ERP/MES (job travelers, material usage),
      waste vendor portals (e-Manifest), time/training systems, and document
      repositories to assemble a single source of truth.
    - >-
      AI extraction and calculations: Extract quantities for lead and other
      reportables, compute TRI thresholds, hazardous waste generator status,
      stormwater sampling calendars, and OSHA 300/300A logs.
    - >-
      Pre-built ammo-specific templates: Auto-draft TRI Form R data tables, RCRA
      Biennial Report sections, Tier II inventories, SPCC evidence lists, and
      OSHA lead standard recordkeeping binders.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: Internal EHS specialist or customer reviewer
      validates every package before submission. The platform never auto-files
      without sign-off.
    - >-
      Audit-prep workspaces: One-click “audit binder” creation (evidence, SOPs,
      permits, training logs, exposure monitoring summaries) with timestamps and
      chain-of-custody.
    - >-
      Alerts and calendars: Renewal/filing calendars (TRI, Tier II, Stormwater
      MSGP, PHMSA registration), permit conditions tracking, exposure sampling
      reminders, and training expirations.
    - >-
      Security and traceability: Role-based access, immutable logs, evidence
      retention policies, and customer-controlled data export for regulator
      requests.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce compliance prep time by 60–80% and external consultant spend by
    30–50% while increasing first-pass filing acceptance to 95%+ by
    automatically compiling plant data into audit-ready packages for
    EPA/OSHA/PHMSA filings—reviewed by humans before submission, with a
    defensible audit trail tailored to ammunition manufacturing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammunition-specific rules engine and labeled document corpus built from real
    plant artifacts, plus pre-built integrations to the ERPs and waste systems
    most used in this niche—enabling higher extraction accuracy, faster
    deployment (<30 days), and audit-ready packages that generic EHS tools or
    consultants cannot match at similar cost/speed.
  customerSegments:
