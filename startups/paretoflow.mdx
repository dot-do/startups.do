  problem:
    - >-
      Loss data is fragmented: free‑text scrap/downtime reasons differ by line,
      shift, and plant; weekly Pareto building in Excel takes hours and is
      error‑prone.
    - >-
      ERP/MES reason codes are incomplete; operators type synonyms/abbreviations
      (e.g., gels vs. contaminants), preventing reliable cross‑plant comparison.
    - >-
      Improvement cadence is inconsistent; top losses aren’t translated into
      focused countermeasures with owners/due dates, so the same issues recur.
    - >-
      Plants can’t quickly segment losses by
      product/resin/tooling/operator/shift to find leverage points for targeted
      actions.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks a single, trustworthy weekly view of material scrap %,
      downtime hours, and the true Top 5 losses that cover 70–85% of losses.
    - >-
      Opportunity cost: 0.5–1.5 pp scrap and 3–8% unplanned downtime persist due
      to slow analysis and weak closed-loop follow‑through.
  solution:
    - >-
      Low‑lift connectors pull weekly production, scrap, and downtime from
      ERP/MES/historian; no PLC change required.
    - >-
      AI normalizes free‑text codes into a film/lamination loss taxonomy
      (material, machine, method, manpower, environment) with confidence scores
      and audit trail.
    - >-
      Auto‑generated Weekly Loss Pack: true Pareto by
      line/product/resin/shift/operator, covering 70–85% of total loss in Top 5
      categories.
    - >-
      Countermeasure engine maps each loss to focused actions (e.g., SMED for
      changeovers, die cleaning cadence for gels, treater checks for adhesion)
      with owners/dates.
    - >-
      Closed-loop action tracker with reminders; measures impact vs. baseline
      and updates ROI automatically.
    - >-
      Plant/enterprise rollups benchmark lines/plants; highlights anomalies and
      wins for rapid replication.
    - >-
      Security-first deployment: customer VPC or on-prem gateway; SSO; data
      residency options; SOC2 roadmap.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weekly, plant-ready loss intelligence from your ERP/MES that normalizes
    messy free-text codes into a standard film/lamination taxonomy and delivers
    prioritized Top 5 losses with recommended countermeasures and action
    tracking—cutting scrap by 0.5–1.5 percentage points and unplanned downtime
    by 3–8% within 3–6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built normalization and countermeasure engine for packaging film
    and lamination: prebuilt taxonomy, connectors, and playbooks that compress
    time-to-value to weeks, plus a weekly CI cadence that closes the loop from
    loss identification to verified savings—difficult for generic analytics
    tools or MES dashboards to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and CI leaders at plastics packaging film & sheet manufacturers (NAICS
    326112) who need a trusted weekly 80/20 on scrap and downtime to align teams
    and hit OEE, yield, and schedule.
  problem: >-
    External: Loss data lives in messy ERP/MES fields—free‑text reasons,
    duplicates, slow reports—so Paretos arrive late and countermeasures scatter.
    Internal: You’re tired of arguing about numbers and firefighting without
    proof of impact. Philosophical: People should fix processes, not clean
    spreadsheets; machines should make good film, not waste resin and hours.
  guide: >-
    We know the realities of film and lamination lines—changeovers, gels, die
    lines, windup breaks, adhesive issues—and the chaos of tribal reason codes.
    Scrap & Downtime Pareto Agent blends plastics process know‑how with AI to
    normalize codes, trend losses, and surface the true top three each week.
    Secure, read‑only, and proven in pilots to drive focused action.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Read‑only link or CSV from ERP/MES; map lines, products, shifts,
    and reason synonyms. 2) Normalize & analyze: Auto‑classify free‑text, build
    a standard taxonomy, compute weekly Pareto by line/shift/product, flag
    spikes. 3) Act: Issue top‑3 countermeasures with owners and checklists,
    track follow‑through and impact. Data stays in your cloud; no PLC changes;
    start with a 30‑day, one‑line pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo and launch a 30‑day pilot on one line.
    Transitional: Download a sample weekly Pareto pack and the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    A single source of truth for scrap and downtime; consistent reason taxonomy
    across plants; aligned weekly focus on the vital few; faster PDCA/A3; lower
    scrap and unplanned downtime; higher OEE and throughput; resin savings;
    fewer meetings and emails; on‑time shipments; stronger margins and calmer
    shifts.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing, keep cleaning spreadsheets, and keep pouring resin into the
    dumpster while overtime climbs, shipments slip, and margins erode—until
    competitors who focus the 80/20 pass you by.
