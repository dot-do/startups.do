leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual detour design is slow (often 8–24 hours per detour), error-prone,
      and requires scarce planner time.
    - >-
      Information fragmentation: roadwork/event notices live in PDFs, emails,
      permitting portals, and GIS; mapping data and service data live elsewhere
      (Esri, CAD/AVL, GTFS editors).
    - >-
      High risk of non-compliant temporary stops (ADA slope/landing clearance),
      illegal maneuvers, and bus-infeasible streets (weight/turn
      radius/clearance).
    - >-
      Inconsistent rider communications and signage; delays push changes after
      service has already started, eroding trust and increasing call center
      volume.
    - >-
      GTFS/GTFS-RT updates and operator bulletins are often manually assembled
      and out-of-sync with what is actually operated.
    - >-
      Coordination overhead with DOTs, public works, police, event organizers,
      and contractors; no shared workflow or audit trail.
    - >-
      Measuring detour impact (OTP, boardings retained, safety incidents) is
      difficult; no feedback loop to improve future detours.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of planned roadwork/event notices from emails, PDFs,
      permitting portals, and GIS feeds; NLP parses dates, extents, and
      restrictions.
    - >-
      Impact detection: identifies affected routes/trips, stop closures, and
      service windows; simulates OTP risk using historic speeds and constraints.
    - >-
      Constraint-based detour builder: proposes multiple feasible detour paths
      considering bus restrictions (turn radii, grades, clearances, weight, lane
      widths), traffic controls, and layover constraints.
    - >-
      ADA-aware temporary stop siting: evaluates sidewalks, crosswalk proximity,
      slope/curb/landing clearance, lighting, and safe dwell; flags compliance
      issues and alternatives.
    - >-
      Signage package generator: printable PDFs with QR codes, multilingual
      templates, operator bulletins, and work orders; digital assets for
      DMS/e-ink signs.
    - >-
      GTFS/GTFS-RT package: edits shapes/stops/calendar_dates, temp_stop flags,
      route/stop alerts, and feeds to trip planners; automatic validation
      (MobilityData rules).
    - >-
      Approval workflow: roles/permissions, versioning, internal and external
      review (DOT/police), and timeboxed publishing; audit log for compliance.
    - >-
      Publishing and notifications: pushes to CAD/AVL, rider apps, websites,
      SMS/email lists, social, and Waze CCP; synchronized
      activation/deactivation windows.
    - >-
      Performance tracking: monitors OTP delta, ridership retention within 400m,
      complaints, and operator incident reports; stores outcomes to improve
      suggestions.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors: Esri, Swiftly, Trapeze/Vontas, Clever Devices, GMV,
      Optibus, Transit App, Google Transit, one.network/INRIX/HERE/TomTom
      closures where available.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn roadwork and events into safe, ADA-aware, operator-vetted detours with
    auto-generated temp stops, signage, and one-click GTFS/GTFS-RT updates—in
    minutes, not days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving detour knowledge graph (closures → detours →
    outcomes) combined with bus-aware constraint routing and ADA siting models,
    plus deep integrations that publish synchronized GTFS and signage in
    minutes. This historical feedback loop and integration footprint are
    difficult and time-consuming for competitors to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      listed on vendor marketplaces (Esri Marketplace, AWS Marketplace).
    - >-
      Participation in APTA, CTAA, TRB, regional transit tech forums; present
      case studies on OTP and complaint reductions.
    - >-
      State and cooperative procurement: Sourcewell, NASPO ValuePoint, Cal-ITP
      Mobility Marketplace to reduce purchasing friction.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transit operations managers, planners, and dispatchers at bus, shuttle, and
    BRT agencies who must keep routes reliable during planned closures and
    events.
  problem: >-
    External: closures force manual detours, ad-hoc temp stops, and error-prone
    GTFS edits; Internal: teams are stretched and worry about rider confusion;
    Philosophical: riders deserve clear, safe, predictable service even when
    streets change; Villain: detour chaos from fragmented notices and late
    updates.
  guide: >-
    Planned Detour Builder + GTFS Package understands the pressure of
    coordinating ops, safety, and rider comms; we bring standards-aligned GTFS
    expertise, risk checks, and integrations with common scheduling, CAD/AVL,
    and work-zone data sources.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect closure sources or upload details. 2) AI proposes policy-aware
    detours, temporary stops, and signage. 3) You review and approve. 4)
    One-click publish GTFS updates, operator bulletins, print kits, and rider
    alerts. 5) Monitor with audit trail and rollback.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot on your next planned closure.
    Transitional: Download the Detour Playbook and implementation checklist.
  success: >-
    Approved detours in hours instead of weeks; accurate GTFS in minutes; clear
    operator instructions and ADA-conscious signage; fewer call-center spikes;
    predictable service and higher rider trust; clean audits and fewer
    surprises.
  failure: >-
    Without it: last-minute scrambles, spreadsheet detour maps, wrong turns,
    missing or non-compliant signage, late GTFS pushes, missed trips, overtime
    costs, and public frustration.
