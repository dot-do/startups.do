  title: Photometric QA and IES Package Builder
  description: >-
    Validates and fixes IES/LDT files, computes BUG/spacing criteria, and
    generates a QA report; can estimate photometry from CAD for early-stage
    review.
  targetUsers:
    - Optical Engineering
    - Product Management
    - Quality
  triggers:
    - New or revised IES uploaded
    - Pre-certification QA run
    - Distributor requests full IES pack
  inputs:
    - IES/LDT files
    - Fixture geometry/CAD (optional)
    - 'Optic/LED package data (lumen, CCT, CRI)'
    - Target certifications/thresholds
  steps:
    - Parse IES/LDT; check format integrity and metadata completeness
    - >-
      Compute zonal lumens, BUG rating, spacing criteria, percent uplight; flag
      anomalies
    - >-
      Auto-fix metadata (lumens, tilt, luminaire size) where possible; version
      control
    - >-
      Optional: estimate photometry from CAD + LED package using Radiance for
      preliminary review
    - Generate QA report and corrected IES pack; push to shared drive/PLM
  tools:
    - Python IES parsers (iesparser)
    - Radiance CLI or Honeybee (optional)
    - Pandas/NumPy/Matplotlib
    - Cloud storage (S3/Google Drive/SharePoint)
  outputs:
    - QA report (PDF) with pass/fail and flags
    - Corrected IES/LDT files
    - 'Summary CSV (BUG, SC, lumens)'
  pricingModel:
    - Per-file or per-SKU fee
    - Monthly subscription for unlimited checks with fair-use cap
    - One-time setup for templates and rules

  risks:
    - Approximated photometry may be misused as certified data
    - Edge-case IES formats may fail parsing
    - Liability if corrections are incorrect
  dependencies:
    - Access to latest IES/LDT files
    - CAD/geometry only if estimation is needed
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      5–20% of manufacturer IES/LDT files contain format/metadata errors (e.g.,
      angle sequencing, tilt flags, lumen mismatch) leading to DLC/specifier
      rejections, 2–6 week launch delays, and $2k–$10k in re-test costs per SKU.
    - >-
      Manual photometric QA takes 30–90 minutes per file using spreadsheets and
      viewers; batch auditing 1,000 files consumes 4–8 engineer-weeks and is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Early-stage designs lack timely photometric feedback until prototypes;
      typical teams incur 1–3 extra lab cycles and slip 4–12 weeks when
      distributions miss targets (BUG, UGR, SC).
    - >-
      Fragmented standards and formats (IES LM-63, IES TM-33, EULUMDAT, regional
      metadata) create packaging rework; missing fields block DLC LUNA/IDA
      submissions and cause agent/specifier RFIs.
    - >-
      Internal PLM/PIM/catalog exports regress silently (e.g., wrong multiplier,
      wrong units, missing keywords) causing downstream calculation errors in
      DIALux/Relux/AGi32 and field returns.
    - >-
      Labs and agents receive heterogeneous file quality; trust suffers, sales
      teams spend time firefighting instead of selling.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated validator/auto-fixer for IES LM-63, TM-33 XML, and EULUMDAT
      (LDT) with a rules engine aligned to IES/CIE/DLC requirements.
    - >-
      Computation of BUG (TM-15), Spacing Criteria (SC0/SC90), UGR tables, DLC
      LUNA/IDA flags, and regional compliance checks; generates a signed QA
      report (PDF/JSON) with pass/fail traceability.
    - >-
      AI-assisted photometry estimation from CAD (STEP/IGES/SolidWorks export)
      and LED package data for early design reviews; outputs draft distributions
      with confidence bands for pre-DLC checks.
    - >-
      Batch processing at scale (10–100k files) with API/CLI and PLM/PIM
      connectors; CI-style gates to block bad exports.
    - >-
      Packaging to multiple targets in one run (IES, LDT, TM-33 XML) + metadata
      normalization, digital signatures, and versioning.
    - >-
      White-label QA badge and hosted share links for agents/specifiers;
      optional private S3/Azure Blob delivery and hash-based integrity checks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, standards-compliant, lab-trusted photometric packages. Validate,
    auto-fix, and publish IES/LDT/TM-33 with verified BUG/SC/UGR in minutes;
    reduce file rejections by 80%+, cut launch delays by 2–6 weeks, and trim 1–2
    lab cycles via AI photometry estimated directly from CAD.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific rules knowledge base and training corpus pairing CAD,
    lab-measured photometry, and real-world IES/LDT errors, plus deep
    integrations with photometric labs and lighting software. This combination
    enables accurate auto-fixes, credible QA badges, and early-stage AI
    estimates that general-purpose tools and in-house scripts cannot replicate
    quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Lighting fixture manufacturers (commercial, industrial, institutional),
    in‑house photometry teams, and test labs who need clean, standards‑aligned
    photometric data (IES/LDT) fast to win specs and reduce risk.
  problem: >-
    External: Messy or nonconforming IES/LDT files, missing BUG and Spacing
    Criteria (SC), bad headers/orientation, AGi32/DIALux import errors, lab
    backlogs, and no early photometry for design reviews.

    Internal: Deadlines slip, RFIs pile up, and confidence with specifiers
    erodes.

    Philosophical: Photometric data should be as reliable and accessible as the
    hardware—QA should be fast, objective, and repeatable.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know late or invalid photometry stalls approvals and triggers
    costly loops between design, lab, and marketing.

    Authority: Built by lighting engineers and AI specialists; validates against
    IES LM‑63 and computes BUG per IES TM‑15; supports IES/LDT (EULUMDAT);
    checks common pitfalls; outputs AGi32/DIALux‑friendly packages; produces
    detailed QA reports; optional human review; API and dashboard workflows.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload IES/LDT or CAD. 2) AI validates/fixes files, estimates
    photometry from CAD when needed, and computes BUG/SC. 3) Receive corrected
    files, a QA report, and a ready‑to‑send package. 4) Iterate via API or
    approve final with a versioned audit trail.

    Agreement: Secure handling (NDA‑friendly), change diffs before acceptance,
    you control release; flexible pricing (pay‑as‑you‑go or volume); no lock‑in.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free validation or request an API key today.

    Transitional: Download a sample QA report + corrected IES and book a
    15‑minute fit call.
  success: >-
    - Clean, standards‑aligned IES/LDT every time

    - Faster spec approvals and fewer RFIs

    - Early‑stage photometry from CAD so design, lab, and marketing move in
    parallel

    - Accurate BUG and spacing criteria; fewer lab re‑shoots

    - Consistent packages for AGi32, DIALux, and PIM/website publishing

    - Traceable QA with diffs/versioning; shorter time‑to‑quote and
    time‑to‑listing
  failure: >-
    - Files rejected by agencies/tools; weeks lost to rework

    - Lab re‑shoots and file churn delay launches

    - Inconsistent data across spec sheets, BIM, and web

    - Missed bids, eroded specifier trust, and warranty risk from incorrect
    photometry/BUG
