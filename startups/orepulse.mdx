  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on crushers, mills, and slurry pumps contributes 3–8%
      lost plant availability in gold/silver processing, costing an estimated
      $30k–$150k per hour of lost throughput.
    - >-
      Calendar- or run-hour-based maintenance doesn’t reflect duty cycles or ore
      hardness variability, leading to both premature overhauls and missed
      failures.
    - >-
      Existing vibration routes are periodic (weekly/monthly) and miss
      fast-developing faults; portable data collection is inconsistent in harsh
      and remote conditions.
    - >-
      High false-alarm rates from generic alarm thresholds create alert fatigue;
      reliability teams ignore alarms or revert to manual checks.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across SCADA/DCS, PLCs, PI/AVEVA historians, and CMMS (SAP
      PM, Maximo, Infor), preventing closed-loop maintenance execution.
    - >-
      Limited on-site connectivity and cybersecurity constraints make purely
      cloud-based analytics impractical; models must run reliably at the edge.
    - >-
      Root-cause knowledge is tribal; post-failure investigations don’t
      consistently translate into asset- or ore-specific predictive models.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy ruggedized, intrinsically safe vibration, motor current, and
      temperature sensing on targeted assets; integrate to existing historians
      via OPC UA/Modbus where available.
    - >-
      Run physics-informed, asset-specific ML models on an edge gateway for
      real-time anomaly detection, fault classification (e.g., bearing,
      imbalance, misalignment, lubrication, cavitation), and remaining useful
      life (RUL).
    - >-
      Fuse process context (ore hardness, feed rate, density, slurry % solids,
      pump NPSH) to minimize false alarms and adapt thresholds.
    - >-
      Auto-generate and update work orders with severity, lead time, parts
      lists, and task plans in CMMS (SAP, Maximo, Infor) via secure APIs;
      include attachments (spectra, trend plots).
    - >-
      Provide reliability dashboards with actionable KPIs (downtime avoided,
      MTBF, false alarm rate), failure libraries, and FMEA-linked
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Deliver remote condition monitoring support and quarterly model tuning
      reviews; close the loop with post-work verification to improve models.
    - >-
      Offer outcome-based pilot with success criteria (e.g., ≥25% reduction in
      unplanned events, ≥5-day median lead time for bearing faults, ≤0.3 false
      positives per asset-month).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime for crushers, mills, and pumps by 20–40% with
    sensor-fusion AI that predicts failures days to weeks in advance and
    automatically generates risk-prioritized work orders in SAP/Maximo —
    delivering payback in under 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, labeled dataset of crusher/mill/pump failures tied
    to CMMS work orders and outcomes, enabling asset- and ore-specific models
    with superior early-warning lead times; combined with closed-loop WO
    automation, OEM partnerships, and an outcome-based pricing model that
    incumbents and generic APM tools struggle to match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and maintenance leaders at gold and silver ore mines who need crushers,
    mills, and pumps to run with maximum uptime and predictable costs.
  problem: >-
    Villain: unplanned failures in rotating assets. External: bearing wear,
    misalignment, cavitation, and slurry abrasion cause sudden breakdowns.
    Internal: constant firefighting, overtime, safety risk, and missed ounce
    targets. Philosophical: mission‑critical assets shouldn’t fail silently when
    data can warn you days in advance.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we know a seized pump or tripped mill can wipe out a shift and
    budget. Authority: reliability engineers + data scientists using ISO‑aligned
    condition monitoring, proven in heavy process industries, integrating with
    SCADA/PI and CMMS (SAP, Maximo, EAM). Transparent reporting and measurable
    outcomes.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: map critical assets, connect vibration/current/temperature data
    (sensors or existing signals) to our platform. 2) Model: baseline behavior,
    detect anomalies, and set action thresholds within weeks. 3) Act:
    auto‑generate prioritized CMMS work orders with fault type, severity, and
    lead time; review in monthly reliability huddles. Agreements: clear ROI
    targets, data security/SLA, no lock‑in pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: start a 90‑day pilot on your most critical line. Transitional:
    request a sample anomaly report and downtime ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Higher uptime and throughput, fewer emergency callouts, lower maintenance
    cost per ton, extended asset life, safer operations, and a proactive culture
    backed by clear, auditable work orders.
  failure: >-
    Continued surprise breakdowns, lost ounces and revenue, blown maintenance
    budgets, rush‑part premiums, longer rebuild cycles, and avoidable safety
    incidents.
