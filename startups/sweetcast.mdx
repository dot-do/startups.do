leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Seasonal peaks (Halloween, Easter, Christmas, Valentine’s) cause
      simultaneous stockouts and overstock; typical post-holiday write-offs run
      8–20% of seasonal inventory.
    - >-
      Pre-book windows, long vendor lead times (12–24 weeks), MOQs, and
      display-pack constraints make ordering risky and manual.
    - >-
      SKU-by-customer forecasting at scale is spreadsheet-driven,
      time-consuming, and ignores promo/display lift and local seasonality.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, EDI, spreadsheets) slows decisions and impedes
      accurate, timely replenishment.
    - >-
      Temperature/melt risk and shelf-life constraints complicate summer
      shipping and freshness management, hurting service levels.
    - >-
      Labor spikes for kitting/display builds and DC capacity bottlenecks before
      holidays aren’t planned alongside demand.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to sell-thru by account leads to poor end-of-season
      liquidation planning and margin erosion.
  solution:
    - >-
      Train per-SKU, per-customer models with multi-holiday seasonality,
      promo/display lift, weather, and local events; reconcile to category/DC
      totals.
    - >-
      Auto-generate weekly purchase proposals by DC/vendor (PO-ready) that honor
      MOQs, case/pallet packs, display units, lead times, vendor allocations,
      and budget constraints.
    - >-
      Pre-season booking optimizer for seasonal lines (12–24 weeks out) to size
      orders and allocation plans by account; scenario planning for promo,
      price, and service-level tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Freshness-aware and melt-window routing logic to avoid spoilage and summer
      service failures.
    - >-
      Exception workflows for buyer overrides with explainable drivers, audit
      trail, and learning from overrides.
    - >-
      Rapid ERP/EDI connectors (P21, NetSuite, Dynamics, SAP B1; SPS
      Commerce/TrueCommerce) and data health diagnostics for fast onboarding.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict SKU-by-customer holiday demand and auto-generate
    purchase/replenishment proposals that respect vendor lead times, MOQs, pack
    sizes, display kits, and shelf-life—cutting stockouts 20–40% and seasonal
    leftovers 25–50% within one season, with go-live in under 8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built for confectionery’s holiday cadence with pre-trained seasonal
