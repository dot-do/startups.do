leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering releases BOMs from CAD/PDM that do not match ERP item master
      (part numbers, revisions, UoM, alternates), causing 5–15% of releases to
      require late ECOs and 2–5 days of rework per incident.
    - >-
      Compliance data (RoHS/REACH SVHC) is missing or stale at release;
      declarations live in spreadsheets/email, creating audit risk and delays in
      EU shipments and SCIP submissions.
    - >-
      Duplicate and near-duplicate parts proliferate due to inconsistent naming
      and attribute standards, inflating inventory by 2–8% and complicating
      sourcing.
    - >-
      Manual cross-checking across CAD/PDM/PLM and ERP is slow and error-prone;
      no automated “quality gate” exists prior to ECO/ECR approval.
    - >-
      Supplier alternates/AML-AVL and lifecycle status (obsolete/NRND) are not
      validated against the current BOM, leading to last-minute purchasing fires
      and expedite costs.
    - >-
      No single audit trail ties engineering decisions to compliance and data
      quality, making it hard to pass customer/ISO audits and to calculate
      first-time-right release rate.
  solution:
    - >-
      SaaS platform that ingests BOMs from CAD/PDM and compares them to ERP item
      master and AML/AVL in minutes; flags and ranks discrepancies with auto-fix
      suggestions.
    - >-
      AI-powered entity matching maps CAD items to ERP items despite
      naming/revision scheme differences; learns from user decisions to improve
      precision over time.
    - >-
      Rules engine enforces company-specific attribute policies (UoM,
      descriptions, lifecycle status, alternates, commodity codes) and industry
      compliance (RoHS/REACH).
    - >-
      Compliance enrichment workflow: validates material declarations against
      SVHC list, tracks supplier declarations and expirations, and computes
      BOM-level coverage and risk score.
    - >-
      Pre-release “quality gate” integration: block or warn in PDM/PLM on
      ECO/ECR unless thresholds (e.g., >95% compliance coverage, zero critical
      mismatches) are met.
    - >-
      Change impact analysis: highlights downstream effects (purchasing, lead
      times, cost rollups) for proposed part changes/substitutions before
      release.
    - >-
      Audit-ready logs and dashboards: evidence of checks, approvals, and
      compliance status tied to each release.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A pre-release digital quality gate that automatically reconciles CAD/PDM
    BOMs to ERP, fixes data mismatches, and verifies RoHS/REACH coverage—so pump
    OEMs release first-time-right, reduce ECOs 30–50%, and are audit-ready by
    design.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific matching models and rules tuned for pump and dispensing
    equipment, plus prebuilt PDM/ERP quality-gate plugins that block bad
    releases at source. Accumulating proprietary mapping datasets and duplicate
    catalogs drive superior accuracy and faster time-to-value that generic
    MDM/iPaaS tools cannot match.

  character: >-
    Ops and engineering leaders at measuring, dispensing, and other pumping
    equipment manufacturers who want CAD/PDM BOMs to match ERP items and
    compliance data before release.
  problem: >-
    External: CAD–ERP BOM mismatches, missing attributes, and RoHS/REACH gaps
    cause delays, ECO churn, and audit risk. Internal: teams waste hours
    reconciling data and dread late surprises. Philosophical: releasing a BOM
    you can trust shouldn’t be this hard.
  guide: >-
    We understand fluid-handling product structures and the pressure of
    compliant, first-pass releases. Our AI checks multi-level assemblies and
    compliance metadata, with clear explanations. Prebuilt rules for RoHS/REACH
    and connectors to common CAD/PDM and ERP systems, plus white-glove
    onboarding, make adoption low-risk.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Read-only link to CAD/PDM and ERP. 2) Check: AI flags structure
    mismatches, missing attributes/UoM, duplicates, lifecycle issues, and
    RoHS/REACH evidence gaps. 3) Resolve: Guided fixes and a release-ready
    report with audit trail. Optional: start with a 2-week pilot on one product
    family.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute discovery and pilot scope. Transitional: Download
    the BOM-to-ERP readiness checklist and sample compliance rules; request an
    ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Accurate, compliant BOMs on first release; fewer ECOs and line stops; faster
    NPI; clean RoHS/REACH documentation; audit-ready traceability; improved
    on-time delivery and customer confidence.
  failure: >-
    Without it: last-minute BOM scrambles, costly rework and delays,
    non-compliance exposure, failed audits, missed ship dates, and eroded trust.
