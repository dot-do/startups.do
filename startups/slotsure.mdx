  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers receive inconsistent lead-time quotes (variance often ±4–8 weeks),
      causing cancellations, reorders, and discounting.
    - >-
      Order slotting is manual (spreadsheets/whiteboards) and not
      constraint-aware, leading to frequent reschedules and overtime.
    - >-
      Plants struggle to account for real bottlenecks (line, station,
      changeovers, component shortages) and supplier lead times when quoting.
    - >-
      Backlog grows in spikes; high-margin orders aren’t prioritized optimally;
      capacity is left idle in some stations while others choke.
    - >-
      ERP/MES/CPQ stacks lack real-time Capable-to-Promise (CTP) at
      configuration level; quoting is disconnected from execution.
    - >-
      Operations leaders lack visibility into achievable throughput and quote
      reliability KPIs across plants/lines.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI/OR engine that scores incoming dealer orders (margin, strategic
      priority, penalty risk) and assigns them to build slots subject to
      capacity, materials, and changeover constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time ATP/CTP lead-time quoting at order-entry via API/portal; returns
      firm promise dates with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization (MIP/CP-SAT) + ML models predicting station times,
      scrap/rework, supplier lead-time risk, and execution slippage.
    - >-
      Constraint library tailored to RV/towable assembly (frame/axle pairing,
      floorplan options, appliance availability, changeover rules).
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning: simulate demand spikes, supplier delays,
      additional shifts, or line rebalance before committing quotes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop feedback: compare promised vs actual; self-learning updates to
      routing times and supplier reliability, improving accuracy monthly.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quote lead times you can keep. Slot orders automatically to maximize margin
    and on-time delivery under real manufacturing constraints (line, station,
    options, and suppliers). 90-day deployment with measurable gains:
    ±5-business-day P95 quote accuracy, 30–50% reduction in schedule changes,
    and +2–4% throughput without capex.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Hybrid optimization + ML tuned to RV/towable constraints with a reusable
    constraint library and prebuilt ERP/CPQ connectors enabling <90-day go-live.
    Accruing data network effects (supplier reliability and station performance
    benchmarks) drive quote accuracy beyond generic APS tools. Transparent,
    auditable promises build trust with dealers and Ops, creating switching
    costs.
