  problem:
    - >-
      Creative misalignment before shoots causes 20–40% of projects to require
      reshoots or extra retouching, adding $3k–$25k per project.
    - >-
      Pre-production visualization takes 3–10 days using manual Photoshop comps,
      delaying approvals and increasing holding/crew costs ($5k–$15k/day).
    - >-
      Moodboards and references don’t translate to actionable shot lists,
      angles, and lighting notes, leading to on-set ambiguity.
    - >-
      In-house e‑commerce studios need to produce 50–500 SKUs/week with
      consistent brand look; manual comps don’t scale.
    - >-
      Existing AI image tools generate on-brand concepts but not from the
      client’s actual product shots, causing mismatch and legal/brand risk.
    - >-
      Stakeholder approvals happen in email/slide decks; no version control or
      asset lineage makes compliance and re-use difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Web app and plugins (Photoshop, Capture One) that ingest product shots
      (PNG/TIFF/RAW), auto-mask, and place into AI-generated or licensed
      backplates matching reference style.
    - >-
      AI-powered layout engine: suggests compositions, lens equivalence, horizon
      line, and crop variants driven by brand style and references.
    - >-
      Relighting and material-aware shadows/reflections to plausibly match scene
      light/color temperature and ground the product.
    - >-
      Reference-to-frame generator: upload mood/reference boards; generate 10–50
      on-brand style frames using your product in matching style/angle.
    - >-
      Approval workflow: threaded comments, versioning, legal flags, and
      stakeholder approvals with audit trail.
    - >-
      Shot list and lighting notes generator: converts approved comps into shot
      lists, lens/focal length targets, lighting diagrams, and prop lists;
      exports to PDF, CSV, or Asana/Shotgrid.
    - >-
      Brand style learning: fine-tune on past approved comps and campaigns for
      consistent look; enforce color/branding guidelines.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: licensed backplate sourcing, asset lineage,
      watermarking, and consent fields for model/property usage.
    - >-
      On-set assist: export overlays/grids to Capture One/Live View, ensuring
      frames match pre-approved comps; real-time tick-off tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Photorealistic style frames from your real product shots and your reference
    scenes in minutes—plus approvals, shot lists, and lighting notes—so teams
    align before shoot day. Cut pre-pro time by up to 50% and reduce reshoots by
    ~30%, with export-ready decks that plug into existing photo workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A product-first pipeline that uses the client’s actual product assets with
    controllable relighting and composition—plus approvals and on-set
    overlays—creates a closed loop from reference to frame to shot. The
    accumulating dataset of approved comps-to-final outcomes fine-tunes
    recommendations per brand, improving realism, approval odds, and on-set hit
    rate over time.
  customerSegments:
