    notes/SAR narratives for analyst review.
  targetUsers:
    - BSA/AML
    - Fraud Ops

    - New AML/fraud alert from monitoring system
    - Transaction anomaly detected
  inputs:
    - Alert metadata and rules hit

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fraud/AML alert volumes are high and noisy; 60–90% of alerts are false
      positives, overwhelming small BSA teams.
    - >-
      Analysts spend 30–60 minutes per alert to gather context across core,
      digital banking, card, ACH/wire, KYC, and case systems; swivel-chairing
      causes inconsistency and errors.
    - >-
      SAR narratives are time-consuming (45–120 minutes) and often fail examiner
      expectations for clarity, chronology, and indicators, increasing rework
      risk.
    - >-
      Existing AML suites prioritize detection/case management; they lack
      explainable triage ranking and regulator-ready narrative drafting tailored
      to CU workflows.
    - >-
      Credit unions face hiring/retention constraints; meeting NCUA/FFIEC
      expectations with limited headcount is difficult without automation.
    - >-
      Model risk management, auditability, and data security deter AI adoption
      without vendor-provided controls and documentation.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted triage ranks AML/fraud alerts by predicted materiality and
      regulatory relevance, highlighting the top X% most likely to result in SAR
      filing.
    - >-
      Automated context aggregation: pulls linked accounts, counterparties, KYC,
      transactions (ACH, wires, card), devices/geo, and historical cases;
      resolves entities; surfaces unusual patterns against member baseline.
    - >-
      Narrative drafting: generates structured SAR narratives
      (who/what/where/when/how/why), timelines, red flags/typologies, dollar
      totals, and filing rationale aligned to FinCEN guidance; includes
      citations linking each sentence to source data.
    - >-
      Investigation workspace: one-screen review with evidence snippets, risk
      factors, and suggested next steps; analysts edit/approve with
      auto-versioning and audit trails.
    - >-
      Model governance & controls: regulator-grade documentation,
      human-in-the-loop approvals, change logs, challenge process,
      bias/validation reports, and data residency options (single-tenant VPC).
    - >-
      Integrations SDK: prebuilt connectors for Symitar, Fiserv DNA/Premier,
      Q2/Alkami digital, card processors (FIS, Fiserv), ACH/wire systems, and
      popular AML/case tools; flat-file/SFTP fallbacks.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2 Type II, SSO/SAML, field-level encryption, PII
      redaction policies, role-based access; option to run on customer cloud
      (AWS/Azure/GCP) with no training on customer data by default.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut alert handling time by 40–70% and improve SAR narrative quality to
    examiner-ready standards by ranking alerts, auto-aggregating context, and
    drafting fact-based, cited narratives—seamlessly layered on top of your
    existing AML stack with full auditability and human-in-the-loop controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Combination of prebuilt CU-native integrations, a curated cross-institution
    typology and narrative library built with SMEs, and a regulator-ready model
    governance package that reduces adoption friction and exam risk;
    human-in-the-loop design with sentence-level citations builds unique trust
    and training data flywheel.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: U.S. credit unions with assets >$250M (approx. 1,600
      institutions) with in-house BSA/AML and fraud operations.
