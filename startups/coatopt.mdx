  problem:
    - >-
      Lost sales from stockouts/backorders in coatings SKUs with long lead times
      and volatile supply; branch line-fill rates commonly <90%.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone substitutions cause rework/returns due to
      incompatibility (tint base, resin system, mixing ratios, VOC, catalyst).
    - >-
      Branch assortments are legacy-driven; slow movers consume working capital
      while high-velocity SKUs face outages; turns often <3.0.
    - >-
      Regional regulations (e.g., CARB/SCAQMD VOC limits), climate, substrate
      mix, and contractor preferences vary by branch, making uniform assortments
      ineffective.
    - >-
      ERP and e-commerce systems lack coatings-specific attributes and
      cross-refs; catalog data is incomplete or inconsistent (TDS/SDS locked in
      PDFs).
    - >-
      Rebate/line review targets versus demand reality create over-assortment
      and SKU duplication (multiple “equivalents” across brands).
  solution:
    - >-
      Build a coatings product knowledge graph by parsing supplier TDS/SDS and
      mapping critical attributes (resin system, solvent/waterborne, VOC,
      base/tint compatibility, sheen, catalyst ratio, pot life, recoat window,
      substrate, application method, pack size, regulatory zones).
    - >-
      Ingest branch-level demand, lead-time, and returns data from ERP/WMS to
      cluster branches by climate, contractor mix, and product usage; recommend
      a core assortment per branch/DC with service-level targets and vendor
      constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time substitution recommender: given a backorder/stockout, return
      ranked substitutes with compatibility scores, callouts of differences, and
      required add-ons (e.g., catalyst, reducer) to preserve margin and
      safety/regulatory compliance.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimization: respect tint-system compatibility (e.g.,
      colorant family/deep base), VOC caps by region, hazmat shipping,
      shelf-life, and supplier rebate targets.
    - >-
      APIs and UI: Embedded recommendations in ERP order entry and e-commerce;
      buyer workbench for line reviews; explainability panel citing TDS
      attributes and reasons for/against substitution.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: Track acceptance, return rates, and outcomes to
      refine models; auto-flag risky substitutions and surface supplier data
      gaps.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Coatings-specific AI that understands chemistry, tint systems, and
    regulations to deliver branch-level core assortments and technically safe
    substitutions—boosting line fill rate 3–5 points, recapturing 1–2% of sales
    lost to stockouts, and improving GMROI 10–20%, with seamless ERP/e-commerce
    integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A coatings-specific knowledge graph built from normalized TDS/SDS across
    brands, continuously labeled by real substitution outcomes and returns;
    VOC/regulatory intelligence by region; and prebuilt ERP connectors. This
    data-network effect and domain tuning are hard for generic planners to
    replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
