leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual skip tracing is slow and inconsistent; investigators spend 30–90
      minutes per file aggregating data from multiple tools (TLOxp, CLEAR, LPR,
      court, utilities).
    - >-
      Contact data quality is poor; 30–50% of numbers/addresses are stale,
      causing wasted dials/door-knocks and compliance risk (wrong-party
      contacts).
    - >-
      Cross-source correlation and ranking is ad hoc; teams lack an objective,
      auditable way to prioritize the next best recovery action.
    - >-
      Compliance exposure is high; lenders and agencies must prove permissible
      purpose, respect cease-and-desist/TCPA flags, handle SCRA/bankruptcy
      checks, and maintain audit trails.
    - >-
      Case systems (RDN/MBSi/Clearplan) are siloed from enrichment tools;
      duplicate data entry and lack of feedback loops hinder learning and
      performance.
    - >-
      Limited access to ALPR/location signals creates missed recovery windows
      and low hit rates on high-risk segments.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click enrichment: ingest a case (name, DOB, VIN/plate, loan details)
      and automatically pull from FCRA/GLBA-permissible sources (credit headers,
      utilities, telco, LPR, NCOA, DMV/DPPA, court, bankruptcy/SCRA, property
      records, email, social signals).
    - >-
      Entity resolution and confidence scoring: deduplicate, link
      associates/cohabitants/garages, verify phones/addresses/employers, and
      score contactability and likelihood-of-asset-presence.
    - >-
      Ranked recovery hypotheses: generate a prioritized list (e.g., where/when
      to knock, likely garage location, worksite window, associate address) with
      probability, evidence, and compliance notes.
    - >-
      Action sequencing: recommended next best actions (call, letter, field
      visit, LPR stakeout) with TCPA/FDCPA/UDAP checks and documented
      permissible purpose.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: outcomes from RDN/MBSi/Clearplan and agent notes
      flow back to retrain models and improve rankings over time.
    - >-
      Auditability and governance: immutable logs of data sources, reasons,
      timestamps, user actions, retention controls, and granular role-based
      access.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compliance-first AI that automates multi-source enrichment and produces
    ranked, auditable recovery hypotheses—cutting time-to-locate by 30–50%,
    increasing verified hits by 15–30%, and reducing wrong-party
    contacts—plug-and-play with RDN/MBSi/Clearplan and major data vendors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop recovery outcomes from integrations create a proprietary
    feedback dataset that competitors without workflow access cannot easily
    replicate; combined with a compliance-by-design engine and deep partner
    integrations, this yields superior, auditable rankings and faster
    time-to-value.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Auto lenders (prime/subprime) and captives handling pre- and
      post-charge-off (collections and recovery)

      nationwide repossessions
    - 'Independent repossession agencies (small to mid-size, 5–100 agents)'
    - Buy-Here-Pay-Here (BHPH) dealers with in-house collections/recovery
    - Credit unions and regional banks managing delinquent auto portfolios
    - 'Equipment finance lenders (light equipment, powersports)'
  channels:

    Process: 1) Connect case data via API or secure upload; 2) Configure
    jurisdictional and policy rules; 3) Receive enriched identities, asset
    linkages, and ranked recovery hypotheses with confidence scores and source
    citations; 4) Integrate into case workflows and field ops. Agreement:
    audit-ready logs, source transparency, human-in-the-loop review, and
    controls aligned to FCRA/GLBA/DPPA and regional privacy requirements.
