  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers of tanks, armored vehicles, and components face high risk of
      inadvertent ITAR/EAR violations due to manual, error-prone document and
      CAD handling across PLM, M365, email, and supplier portals.
    - >-
      Export control classification (USML/ECCN) and labeling are slow (often
      2–10 days turnaround) and inconsistent, delaying bids, design reviews, and
      supplier collaboration.
    - >-
      CAD and technical data are hard to sanitize; engineers over-share or block
      work due to uncertainty, creating either compliance exposure or
      operational friction.
    - >-
      Recipient screening is fragmented (identity, citizenship, org, location,
      denied party lists), resulting in gaps and audit findings.
    - >-
      Compliance teams lack end-to-end, immutable audit trails tying
      classification decisions, approvals, and distribution to specific users
      and versions for investigations and disclosures.
    - >-
      Existing DLP/MIP tools lack deep CAD awareness and USML Category
      VII/600-series specifics, forcing costly manual review.
    - >-
      Frequent regulatory updates (BIS/EAR, USML revisions, sanctions) outpace
      static policies, making it difficult to keep rules current across systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multimodal classifier for documents, drawings, and CAD that detects
      ITAR/EAR scope and proposes USML Category VII and 600-series ECCNs (e.g.,
      0A606/0E606) with confidence scores and rationale.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workflow: configurable thresholds for
      auto-approve, escalate, or require dual control; side-by-side rationale
      and citations to regs and prior decisions.
    - >-
      Automated labeling and access control: applies MIP/Titus labels and ABAC
      policies to files, PLM items, and emails; enforces US Person/geo
      restrictions; blocks or quarantines disallowed transmissions.
    - >-
      Recipient and transaction screening: real-time checks against
      BIS/OFAC/State DDTC lists, citizenship/ITAR US Person status, org
      affiliation, data location, program/TAA restrictions, and contract
      clauses.
    - >-
      Redaction and shareable derivatives: CAD decimation/simplification,
      feature removal, metadata scrubbing, drawing masking/watermarking, and
      document redaction to produce non-controlled or EAR99 versions where
      possible.
    - >-
      Immutable audit trail: hash-chained, time-stamped records of
      classifications, policy evaluations, user actions, and distribution
      events; exportable for disclosures and audits (WORM storage/QLDB-like).
    - >-
      Connectors and in-path enforcement: native integrations for Teamcenter,
      Windchill, Enovia, NX/Creo/CATIA/SolidWorks, SharePoint/OneDrive,
      Outlook/Exchange, SFTP/MFT, Slack/Teams, Box/Egnyte Gov, SIEM/SOAR, DLP,
      and CASB.
    - >-
      Policy and rule engine continuously updated with BIS/EAR/USML changes and
      company-specific carve-outs (licenses, TAAs, MLAs, NDA program lists).
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem/air-gapped, SCIF-friendly, or AWS
      GovCloud/Azure Government; US Persons-only support; NIST 800-171/CMMC
      alignment; path to FedRAMP Moderate/High and DoD IL5.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native, CAD-aware export control guardian that auto-classifies ITAR/EAR
    technical data, proposes accurate USML/ECCN tags, enforces access and
    routing across your toolchain, screens recipients in real time, and produces
    redacted, shareable artifacts—backed by an immutable audit trail—cutting
    violations and cycle time without slowing engineering.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Defense-CAD-native classifiers trained on a proprietary, adjudicated corpus;
    prebuilt enforcement across PLM/CAD/email; immutable audit vault; and US
    Persons-only operations with Gov-ready architectures. Early ATOs and
    design-partner references in armored vehicle programs create high switching
    costs and credibility.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Program, engineering, and export-compliance leaders at armored vehicle,
    tank, and component manufacturers who must move technical data
    quickly—without violating ITAR/EAR.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual classification and routing of CAD and technical data is
    slow, error-prone, and rules/partners change constantly. Internal: One
    mistaken share can trigger fines, debarment, program delays, and lost trust.
    Philosophical: Mission-critical work should be both fast and fully
    compliant.
  guide: >-
    We understand the burden of export control in high-tempo defense programs.
    Our AI-powered classifier and routing agent, tuned to ITAR/EAR policy and
    identity context, prevents leaks before they happen, enforces access labels,
    and proves due diligence with a complete audit trail.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PLM/PDM, DMS, cloud drives, and email; define jurisdictions,
    USML/ECCN policies, and approved parties. 2) Auto-classify CAD/docs as
    ITAR/EAR, propose USML/ECCN, apply labels, and continuously screen
    recipients. 3) Route or block shares, generate redacted exportable versions,
    and capture tamper-evident logs for audit and oversight.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a secure pilot with your sample files. Transitional: Schedule
    a compliance readiness demo and risk snapshot.
  success: >-
    Confidently share CAD and tech data, reduce manual review, speed partner
    onboarding, maintain chain-of-custody, pass audits, protect IP, and keep
    programs on schedule.
  failure: >-
    Accidental exports, costly fines and stop-work orders, IP leakage, rework,
    delays in foreign military sales, and lasting reputational damage.
