  title: Warranty Claims Triage and Root-Cause Clustering
  description: >-
    AI clusters incoming warranty claims, extracts failure modes, prioritizes
    issues, and drafts actions for service and engineering.
  targetUsers:

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual warranty triage is slow and inconsistent: OEMs take 2–10 days to
      cluster and route new issues; seasonal spikes (spring/fall) create
      backlogs that delay corrective actions.
    - >-
      Dealer notes are unstructured and noisy; 25–40% of claims are miscoded by
      symptom/cause, making trend detection and cost attribution unreliable.
    - >-
      Repeated failures persist: 10–20% of warranty cost is driven by a small
      number of recurring, poorly-identified failure modes that escape early
      detection.
    - >-
      Engineering feedback loops are weak; FMEA updates and design change
      requests lag by weeks, extending detection-to-correction lead time and
      increasing field exposure.
    - >-
      Warranty spend is material: typically 1.5–3.0% of revenue in outdoor power
      equipment; a 10% reduction can improve EBIT by 50–150 bps.
    - >-
      Electrification adds complexity: battery/BMS, controllers, and charging
      introduce new failure signatures not captured by legacy taxonomies.
    - >-
      Field images, IoT/telematics, and parts returns are underutilized; current
      tools rarely combine these data to prioritize actions by risk and cost.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/Warranty modules (SAP/Oracle) provide record-keeping but
      limited automated clustering, failure-mode extraction, or action drafting
      tailored to OPE.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from warranty systems, dealer DMS, parts returns,
      telematics/BMS, and images; normalize to an OPE-specific schema.
    - >-
      AI/ML pipeline to auto-cluster issues (symptom→cause→part→model→lot),
      extract failure modes mapped to FMEA taxonomy, and score
      severity/occurrence/detectability.
    - >-
      Risk-based prioritization combining incident rate, warranty cost, safety
      flags, seasonality, and customer impact to generate a Top N issue list per
      product line weekly.
    - >-
      Action drafting assistant: creates first-draft containment plans, service
      bulletins, parts hold notices, and engineering tickets with root-cause
      hypotheses and required data.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration with PLM/ALM (e.g., Teamcenter, Windchill),
      ERP/Warranty modules (SAP/Oracle/IFS), and ticketing (Jira, ServiceNow) to
      track corrective actions to closure.
    - >-
      Dealer assistance: suggest claim coding, likely cause, and diagnostic
      steps to improve first-time fix and reduce miscodes at submission.
    - >-
      Anonymized benchmarking (opt-in clean room): compare failure-mode rates,
      time-to-detect, and parts MTBF vs. industry peers without exposing PII or
      brand data.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review for safety-critical clusters and model updates;
      governance workflows and audit trails for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut warranty cost and cycle time by automatically clustering claims,
    extracting failure modes from unstructured dealer notes, images, and sensor
    logs, and drafting prioritized corrective actions—purpose-built for outdoor
    power equipment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically trained warranty language model and failure taxonomy tailored
    to outdoor power equipment, reinforced by human-in-the-loop reviews and
    opt-in cross-OEM benchmarking. Integration depth with dealer DMS and PLM/ERP
    workflows shortens D2C in ways generic analytics tools cannot. Early
    partnerships with Tier-1 engine/battery suppliers provide unique visibility
    into emergent electrification failure modes.

  character: >-
    Warranty, service, and quality leaders at NAICS 333112 OEMs (lawn and garden
    tractors and equipment) who want early, reliable visibility into emerging
    failures to protect brand, reduce cost, and support dealers and owners.
  problem: >-
    Claims arrive noisy and unstructured across dealers and channels; true
    failure modes hide in free text; teams triage manually, prioritize on
    anecdotes, fix too late, and warranty costs climb.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived your warranty firefights. Our team blends OEM reliability
    expertise with production-grade NLP/ML, proven on millions of claims, to
    deliver auditable failure-mode clusters and secure, enterprise-ready
    deployment.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect claims, parts returns, and field notes—no system rip-and-replace.
    2) AI clusters issues, extracts failure modes, quantifies impact, and drafts
    service/engineering actions. 3) Your team reviews weekly, publishes
    bulletins/ECNs, and tracks closure. Pilot live in 6–8 weeks.
  callToAction: >-
    Request a demo and start a 60-day pilot using 12 months of claims; get a
    prioritized issue map and draft actions by week two.
  success: >-
    Detect emerging failures 4–12 weeks sooner, cut triage time 70%, shorten
    time-to-root-cause 50%, reduce warranty spend 5–15%, deliver clearer dealer
    guidance, and raise owner satisfaction.
  failure: >-
    Without this, signal stays buried: repeat repairs, late fixes, recall risk,
    parts misstocking, dealer frustration, engineering backlogs, and brand
    erosion.
