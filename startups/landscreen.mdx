  title: Land Deal Screen & Quick Underwriting
  description: >-
    5–30 minute AI screen for raw or entitled land: comps, yield, residual land
    value, absorption, and red flags with a concise memo.
  targetUsers:
    - Land Acquisition Manager
    - Division President
    - Finance/Feasibility Analyst
  triggers:
    - New parcel lead/email
    - CSV of parcels dropped into shared drive
    - Prospector form submission
  inputs:
    - Site address/APN
    - 'Target product (sf, price band, attached/detached)'
    - 'High-level costs (impact/fees, dev cost/lot, hard $/sf)'
    - Zoning/entitlement notes
    - Absorption target
  steps:
    - Geocode and pull parcel/ownership/zoning
    - Fetch nearby new-home comps and active supply; estimate achievable ASP
    - Estimate lot yield from acreage/zoning/setbacks using heuristics
    - Project absorption using local sales pace and seasonality
    - Compute residual land value and sensitivity table
    - Generate 1–2 page memo with maps and risk flags
  tools:
    - Google Maps Geocoding & Elevation
    - County GIS/Assessor APIs (where available)
    - ATTOM/Redfin/Zillow data feeds (licensed)
    - US Census/ACS API
    - ESRI ArcGIS/ArcGIS Online
    - LLM for memo drafting
    - Python/Excel model
  outputs:
    - 'Underwriting XLS (yield, absorption, RLV)'
    - Memo PDF with assumptions and risk flags
    - Comp set CSV and map images
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per deal screen (e.g., $300–$1,000)'
    - Monthly retainer for unlimited within cap
    - 'Add-on: deep-dive pro forma'

  risks:

    - Basic cost assumptions from builder
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Land teams spend 2–6 hours per deal gathering comps, zoning, fees, and
      constraints across fragmented sources, delaying LOIs and letting
      competitors lock up sites first.
    - >-
      Underwriting quality varies by analyst and market; leadership lacks a
      standardized, comparable memo and audit trail across divisions.
    - >-
      Missed red flags (floodplain, wildfire, wetlands, concurrency/utility
      limits, fee shocks, policy changes) trigger late kills or costly
      re-trades.
    - >-
      Comps and absorption assessments rely on manual, stale research; yield and
      residual land value (RLV) estimates are inconsistent across product types.
    - >-
      Data licensing and GIS expertise are non-core but required to underwrite
      land quickly and accurately.
    - >-
      Builders can’t economically screen the long tail of opportunities; only a
      small fraction of leads get vetted, reducing hit rate on the best sites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve web app and API: input address/APN/parcel polygon or upload a
      broker package; returns a 1–2 page memo plus detailed annexes in 5–30
      minutes.
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion: parcel, ownership, topography,
      flood/wildfire/wetlands, schools, utilities, zoning/land-use, fees, comps
      (new home, resale, finished lot), permit pipeline, and competitive
      communities.
    - >-
      Scenario engine: tests multiple product/lot configurations (e.g., SFD
      40'/50'/60', townhomes) with density/yield ranges and costs to compute
      residual land value bands.
    - >-
      Absorption model: benchmarks against comparable subdivisions and nearby
      new-home community sales velocity with seasonality and price elasticity.
    - >-
      Red-flag detection: environmental, entitlement complexity, policy/fee
      risk, utilities/concurrency constraints, access/ingress-egress, HOA/CCRs,
      split zoning, overlays.
    - >-
      Concise memo: executive summary, comps table, yield/absorption/RLV with
      confidence ranges, deal breakers and diligence list, map snapshots, and
      export (PDF/Excel/CSV).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop option: a senior analyst reviews and upgrades the memo
      for critical LOIs or IC decks within 24 hours.
    - >-
      Integrations: push results to Salesforce/Lasso/Dealpath; notifications to
      Slack/Teams/Email; GIS exports to Esri shapefiles/GeoJSON.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Go/no-go land screen in 5–30 minutes with bank-ready comps, yield, residual
    land value, absorption, and red flags—delivered as a concise, standardized
    memo. Reduce analyst time by 80%, expand deal coverage 2–3x, and improve bid
    accuracy and speed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Builder-calibrated underwriting models trained on proprietary outcomes data
    and analyst feedback from pilot partners, combined with a standardized
    IC-ready memo format and deep integrations into builder land
    pipelines—delivering consistent, defensible go/no-go decisions in minutes,
    not hours.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    For‑sale homebuilder land/acquisition team that needs fast, defensible deal
    screens to hit growth and margin targets.
  problem: >-
    External: Land packages outpace analyst capacity; comps are noisy;
    entitlements unclear; underwriting is slow/expensive. Internal: Pressure to
    say yes; fear of overpaying or passing on winners. Philosophical: Builders
    should make same‑day, data‑backed calls with clarity and discipline.
  guide: >-
    Builder‑trained analysts + AI, built for NAICS 236117 workflows. We speak
    yield, residual land value, and absorption. The engine compresses a
    first‑pass underwrite into 5–30 minutes using local comps, program
    assumptions, and risk cues. Private by design; NDA‑ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload an address/parcel and basic program. 2) Receive a 5–30 minute AI
    screen: comps, yield, residual land value, absorption, red flags, concise
    memo. 3) Act: go/no‑go, set offer, or trigger full due diligence. Agreement:
    no process change; pay‑per‑screen or plan; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Upload a parcel to run your first screen or book a 15‑minute demo.
    Transitional: Download a sample memo and methodology.
  success: >-
    Make confident same‑day decisions; sharpen offers; avoid dead LOIs; catch
    red flags early; speed the land cycle; improve hit rate and margin; let your
    team focus on negotiation and entitlements, not spreadsheets.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing; overpay; miss hidden risks; burn analyst hours; re‑trade or
    write off deals; slow lot flow; lose quarters to bad dirt.

    title: Land Deal Screen & Quick Underwriting
    subtitle: >-
      For for‑sale housing builders. AI screens raw or entitled land in 5–30
      minutes—comps, yield, residual land value, absorption, red flags, and a
      concise memo.
    ctaText: Screen a Deal
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - You’re flooded with parcels but underwriting bandwidth is thin.
    - Manual comping and zoning review burn days.
    - Assumptions vary by analyst; decisions aren’t apples‑to‑apples.
    - 'Red flags surface late, after time and money are sunk.'
    - Brokers want fast answers; you miss LOI windows.
    - Cost to chase dead deals kills hit rate.
    - Market shifts make stale comps risky.
    - 'Data is fragmented across MLS, assessor, zoning, and permits.'
  solution:
    - 'Turn any APN, address, or polygon into an actionable screen in minutes.'
    - Standardize comps and assumptions for consistent buy boxes.
    - 'Instant yield, residual land value, and absorption forecasts.'
    - Automated zoning/entitlement checks to de‑risk early.
    - Clear red‑flag callouts with confidence scores.
    - 'One‑page memo for IC, lender, or seller—auto‑generated.'
    - Export to Excel/PDF and push to your pipeline tools.
    - Scale deal flow without adding headcount.
  features:
    - 'Parcel input: address, APN, lat/long, or drawn boundary.'
    - 'Uploads: plats, site plans, broker packages (PDF).'
    - 'Comp engine: MLS, assessor, new‑home closings, and land trades.'
    - Zoning/entitlement parsing from municipal codes and permits.
    - 'Product presets: detached, townhomes, condos, build‑to‑sell.'
    - 'Pro forma knobs: costs, fees, margins, target IRR, lot size.'
    - Residual land value and land‑per‑front‑foot metrics.
    - Absorption modeling by submarket and price band.
    - 'Scenario/sensitivity: pricing, costs, pace, rates.'
    - 'Red‑flag detection: access, flood, wetlands, utilities, density caps.'
    - 'Map layers: schools, comps, pipeline, FEMA/flood, HOAs.'
    - 'Memo generator: highlights, comp set, underwriting summary, next steps.'
    - 'Exports and integrations: PDF, Excel, API, webhooks, Salesforce.'
    - 'Team controls: templates, permissions, audit trail.'
  steps:
    - 'Drop a pin, APN, or draw the parcel.'
    - Select product type and set assumptions (or use your template).
    - AI builds the comp set and parses zoning/entitlements.
    - 'Review yield, residual, absorption, and sensitivities.'
    - Scan red flags and site constraints on the map.
    - Export the memo and push to your deal pipeline or draft an LOI.
