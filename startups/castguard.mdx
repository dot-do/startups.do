  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned die or shot sleeve failures cause high-cost downtime (often
      $1,000–$3,000/hour per press) and missed deliveries.
    - >-
      Most maintenance is scheduled by calendar or rough cycle thresholds, not
      by actual condition or process signals, leading to premature replacements
      or late interventions.
    - >-
      Tooling lifecycle data (die cards, cycle counts, sleeve wear) is
      fragmented across PLCs, spreadsheets, CMMS, and tribal knowledge, reducing
      traceability and forecast accuracy.
    - >-
      Presses run diverse alloys and part programs; shifts and operators vary;
      it’s hard to detect process drift that accelerates die cracking,
      soldering, or sleeve wear.
    - >-
      Limited ability to forecast maintenance windows and order lead-times
      results in expedited tooling costs, premium freight, and excess inventory.
    - >-
      Shot profiles (plunger velocity, fill time, intensification pressure) are
      rarely analyzed continuously for predictive insights due to lack of
      specialized analytics.
    - >-
      Existing PdM tools focus on motors/bearings, not die/sleeve wear
      mechanisms (thermal fatigue, erosion, soldering, abrasion) specific to
      nonferrous die casting.
    - >-
      Plants struggle to quantify ROI of maintenance actions, hampering
      continuous improvement and budget justification.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to press PLCs and shot monitoring systems to ingest cycles,
      plunger velocity, fill time, intensification pressure, thermocouple data,
      lubricant usage, and operator inputs.
    - >-
      Create an asset graph that links presses, dies, sleeves, inserts, and part
      programs to actual cycle histories and maintenance records (die cards,
      CMMS).
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models predict risk of die cracking, soldering,
      washout/erosion, sleeve ID wear, and plunger tip failure by combining
      cycle counts with process conditions and thermal exposure.
    - >-
      Deliver asset-level risk scores (0–100) and forecast maintenance windows
      (with confidence intervals) for each die and sleeve; simulate deferral
      impact on risk and scrap.
    - >-
      Automate alerts to CMMS for planned work orders and spare reservations;
      sync BOMs and inventory for sleeves, plunger tips, coatings, and inserts.
    - >-
      Dashboards for MTBF, tool life vs. target, scrap drivers, and process
      drift by part, alloy, lubricant, and press; multi-plant benchmarking.
    - >-
      Edge gateway for on-prem collection with optional cloud analytics; works
      with minimal new sensors by leveraging existing shot monitor/PLC signals.
    - >-
      Rapid pilot playbook: 6–8 weeks from kickoff to live predictions on 3–5
      presses, with weekly value tracking and ROI report.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predictive maintenance specifically for dies, shot sleeves, and consumables
    in nonferrous die casting. We forecast maintenance windows and risk using
    cycles and condition data to cut unplanned downtime by 20–40%, extend
    sleeve/die life by 10–20%, and reduce scrap 5–10%, with failure alerts 24–72
    hours in advance and maintenance scheduling you can trust.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary corpus linking cycle-by-cycle shot profiles to specific
    die/sleeve failure modes, combined with physics-informed ML tuned to
    nonferrous die casting. Prebuilt connectors to common press/shot monitors
    and CMMS compress deployment to weeks. Early OEM/tooling supplier
    partnerships create data network effects and switching costs.
