leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Change impacts are scattered across PLM, ERP/MRP, MES, QMS, DMS, and
      supplier portals, making cross-system analysis slow and error-prone
      (typical ECO cycle time 20–45 days).
    - >-
      Undetected impacts drive scrap/rework and line stops (0.2–1.0% of COGS in
      avoidable material disposition is common during late-stage ECOs).
    - >-
      Configuration/effectivity and multi-plant routings cause partial or
      incorrect impact coverage (variant BOMs, supersessions, alternates, and
      phantom BOMs frequently missed).
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance gaps (e.g., ISO 9001/AS9100, ITAR/EAR, RoHS/REACH,
      DFARS/NIST 800-171) surface late due to siloed document control and lack
      of traceability to parts/changes.
    - >-
      Human dependency risk: tribal knowledge and manual spreadsheets don’t
      scale to complex product structures (10k–100k+ part BOMs).
    - >-
      Audits and customer PPAP/FAI-like demands require demonstrable, auditable
      impact rationale, which current tools seldom provide.
    - >-
      Supplier changes and long lead components aren’t tied to ECOs quickly,
      causing excess/obsolete inventory and missed buy-plan updates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified connectors ingest product, process, and compliance data from PLM
      (e.g., Teamcenter, Windchill, 3DEXPERIENCE), ERP/MRP (e.g., SAP, Oracle,
      IFS, Infor), MES/QMS/DMS, and supplier data sources.
    - >-
      Graph-based digital thread models parts, configurations, effectivity,
      routings, documents, training, suppliers, and inventory by plant and
      date-code/lot.
    - >-
      AI-driven impact engine: identifies directly and indirectly affected
      parts, alternates/supersessions, time-phased inventory/buys/WIP, affected
      routings/operations/tooling, and linked documents/SOPs/training.
    - >-
      Risk scoring and what-if simulation: scenario runs estimate cost,
      lead-time, and compliance risk; suggests mitigation (use-up plans, lot
      segregation, alternate sourcing, phased effectivity).
    - >-
      Compliance intelligence: rulesets for ISO 9001/AS9100, ITAR/EAR,
      RoHS/REACH, DFARS/NIST 800-171, UL/CE/SAE mappings; flags gaps in records,
      training, and doc linkages when ECOs propagate.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: pushes actionable tasks into PLM/ERP workflows
      (approvals, buy plan changes, disposition, training updates) with full
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: explainable results with trace links back to
      source systems; configurable approval thresholds and sign-offs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, auditable ECO/ECN impact analysis across BOMs, routings,
    inventory, documents, training, suppliers, and compliance—delivered in
    minutes, not weeks—reducing change-related scrap and cycle time by 20–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Manufacturing and engineering leaders in NAICS 336999 (All Other
    Transportation Equipment) who must implement ECO/ECNs across complex,
    safety-critical assemblies without disrupting production or compliance.
  problem: >-
    Every change ripples across multi-level BOMs, routings, inventory,
    documents, and compliance. Manual analysis is slow and error-prone, leading
    to missed where-used items, wrong effectivity, shortages, rework, delays,
    and audit risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand high-mix, low-volume transportation equipment and the pressure
    of zero-defect, on-time delivery. Engineering Change Impact Analyzer is an
    AI service that unifies ERP/PLM/MES data and produces clear, auditable
    impact reports tailored to 336999 operations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely integrate ERP/PLM/MES/PDM and import recent ECO/ECNs.
    2) Analyze: AI maps where-used, alternates, effectivity, routing and
    capacity, inventory at risk, impacted documents, and compliance obligations;
    returns risk scores and recommended actions. 3) Execute: Route approvals,
    set cut-in, update document packs, notify suppliers, and track outcomes with
    closed-loop metrics.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute pilot using a real ECO. Secondary: Download a
    sample impact report and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Full visibility of change impacts; faster approvals; fewer shortages and
    line stops; reduced scrap and expedite costs; on-time implementations;
    audit-ready traceability across BOMs, routings, inventory, documents, and
    compliance.
  failure: >-
    Persist with spreadsheets and guesswork; overlook affected parts and
    documents; trigger rework, delays, write-offs, and potential noncompliance;
    erode margins and customer trust.
