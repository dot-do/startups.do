leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual cue sheet creation is slow and error-prone: 2–8 hours per 60-minute
      episode, with 10–30% of cue sheets returned by networks/PROs for
      corrections, delaying payments to composers and publishers by months.
    - >-
      Mixes/EDLs rarely line up cleanly: re-conforms, reel splits,
      drop-frame/non-drop-frame, and multi-version deliveries cause timecode
      drift and mismatches that are hard to reconcile by hand.
    - >-
      Metadata fragmentation: Libraries, composers, and post teams store track
      metadata (IPI/CAE, ISWC, PRO splits) in disparate systems; missing or
      stale data leads to rejected cue sheets and lost royalties.
    - >-
      Compliance burden: Each PRO/network requires slightly different formats
      and fields; staying current and validating requirements is costly for
      small post teams and indie producers.
    - >-
      Scale challenges: High-volume unscripted/reality, promo, and OTT
      deliverables need cue sheets at scale; manual workflows don’t keep up,
      creating backlog and audit risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Upload final mixes (WAV/AIFF/MP4), EDLs/AAF/XML from
      Avid/Premiere/Resolve, and optional stems; import library/composer
      metadata via CSV/API.
    - >-
      Detect & align: AI/DSP models detect music regions, down to -20 LUFS
      under-dialog thresholds; proprietary timecode alignment handles
      re-conforms, reel splits, and drop/non-drop discrepancies within ±5
      frames.
    - >-
      Identify: Match cues to supplied metadata via filename/ISRC/ISWC/track ID;
      optional third-party fingerprinting (e.g., ACRCloud/BMAT) for blind
      recognition.
    - >-
      Enrich: Auto-fill composer/publisher shares, PRO affiliations, IPI/CAE,
      ISWC, ISRC, cue type (BG/Feature/Theme), and usage notes; flag
      conflicts/missing fields for human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      Validate: Real-time schema validation per network/PRO requirements;
      preflight checks for cue length rounding, overlapping cues, and timing
      continuity.
    - >-
      Export & submit: One-click export to PRO-ready CSV/XLSX/PDF/XML;
      per-network templates; optional direct submission via partner integrations
      where available.
    - >-
      Audit trail: Versioned cue sheets, change logs, reviewer sign-off, and
      delivery receipts per episode/film.
    - >-
      Scale: Batch processing and API endpoints for high-volume providers; SSO,
      user roles, and project templates for studios/post houses.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate PRO-ready cue sheets in minutes—not days—by auto-detecting and
    timing music from mixes/EDLs, verifying metadata, and exporting to the exact
    formats required by ASCAP/BMI/SESAC/SOCAN/PRS, with frame-accurate timecodes
    and built-in compliance checks. Reduce manual effort by 80–90% and cut
    rejection rates below 2%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned detection and timecode alignment models trained on real mixed
    program audio and re-conform scenarios, plus authoritative metadata
    partnerships with libraries/publishers and up-to-date PRO/network validator
    templates—making exports accepted on first submission. Early integrations
    into NLE/DAW workflows reduce friction and create stickiness.

    Music supervisors, post supervisors, and music editors at film/TV
    productions and audio post houses who must deliver accurate cue sheets fast.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual cue sheets from mixes/EDLs are slow, error‑prone, and
    inconsistent across networks and territories.

    Internal: Fear of missed cues and split errors that cause disputes,
    rejections, and late nights.

    Philosophical: Creators deserve every royalty—administration shouldn’t steal
    creative time.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the 2 a.m. delivery crunch and the chaos of messy
    metadata and versioning.

    Authority: Purpose‑built AI for cue detection and timing, human‑in‑the‑loop
    QA, enterprise security, and PRO‑ready exports (ASCAP, BMI, PRS, SOCAN) plus
    common network templates—trusted by post teams on series, films, and promos.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Upload a mix/printmaster and/or EDL (from common NLEs) or connect your
    storage.

    2) AI detects cues, in/out/timecode, durations, and source; auto‑matches
    titles, ISRC/ISWC, libraries, and splits.

    3) Review conflicts, confirm splits, and approve.

    4) Export PRO‑ready CSV/XML/PDF and network‑specific templates; optional
    API/webhook submission and audit trail.

    Agreement:

    - Your audio and metadata remain yours; private by default with access
    controls.

    - Clear logs, versioning, and support SLAs.

    cue sheet from test media; Use the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    - Accurate cue sheets in minutes, not days.

    - Fewer rejections and faster royalty payouts.

    - Clean metadata, version control across cuts/localizations, and a
    searchable archive.

    - Happy composers and producers; reduced admin; more time for creative work.
  failure: >-
    - Missed cues and split errors leading to rejected sheets and delayed
    payments.

    - Lost royalties and disputes with composers/publishers.

    - All‑nighters before delivery and reputational risk with
    networks/platforms.

    - Fragmented spreadsheets and no audit trail.
