leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      5–15% of daily baked goods typically remain unsold at close, leading to
      waste or deep last‑minute discounts that erode brand and margins.
    - >-
      Markdown decisions are manual, inconsistent, and made under time pressure
      by staff without data (weather, events, foot traffic) to forecast demand
      or set guardrails.
    - >-
      Static POS “happy hour” discounts and one‑size‑fits‑all “surprise bags”
      fail to optimize per‑SKU sell‑through or preserve margin.
    - >-
      Most bakeries lack a simple way to push coordinated time‑boxed offers
      across POS, delivery platforms, Google Business Profile, and in‑store
      signage.
    - >-
      No clear measurement of discount effectiveness, price elasticity, or true
      profit impact; owners cannot quantify waste cost vs. discount revenue.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate to POS to ingest real‑time sales, on‑hand counts, historical
      velocity by SKU, and scheduled production; augment with weather, local
      events, and foot‑traffic signals.
    - >-
      Forecast per‑SKU, per‑store demand by time block; recommend a dynamic
      markdown ladder (e.g., 10% at T‑120, 20% at T‑60, 30% at T‑30) with
      minimum price and brand guardrails.
    - >-
      Auto‑push markdowns to POS menus, delivery platforms (DoorDash/Uber Eats),
      Google Business Profile Offers/Posts, Instagram Stories templates, and
      in‑store dynamic QR signage.
    - >-
      Offer “smart bundles” (e.g., 3‑pack of mixed pastries) to improve
      attachment and maintain perceived value instead of blanket deep cuts.
    - >-
      Provide a staff mobile app: item tagging, photo capture, quick bundles,
      one‑tap “last call,” and pick/pack for online offers.
    - >-
      Run A/B tests by SKU/store/day; learn price elasticity and optimize
      discount ladders; weekly insight emails with clear actions (adjust bake
      sheet, earlier cutoffs, bundling tips).
    - >-
      Compliance and brand guardrails: minimum margin thresholds, rounded prices
      (.25/.50), excluded premium SKUs, allergy/labeling prompts.
    - >-
      Optional: integrate with Too Good To Go or similar as a final safety net
      for remaining inventory, using data‑driven trigger points rather than
      default use.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Clear 30–60% more end‑of‑day units with 5–10% less margin erosion by
    auto‑forecasting demand and pushing guardrailed, channel‑synced
    markdowns—fully integrated with your POS and delivery platforms in under one
    week.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, cross‑channel dataset of perishable bakery SKUs at sub‑hour
    granularity combined with guardrailed markdown algorithms; pre‑built POS and
