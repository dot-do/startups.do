  problem:
    - >-
      Margin leakage from volatile cocoa/sugar/packaging prices is not visible
      until month-end; finance and ops can’t react quickly to protect margins.
    - >-
      Costing lives in spreadsheets or generic ERP modules that don’t model
      confectionery-specific yields (tempering losses, enrobing overrun, shell
      molding losses, changeover scrap, rework).
    - >-
      Standard costs are outdated; SKU-level actual margin vs standard is hard
      to reconcile because waste codes and rework aren’t tied to recipes and
      machine conditions.
    - >-
      Quoting and price updates lag commodity price swings by weeks, risking
      unprofitable contracts and missed surcharges.
    - >-
      Procurement can’t quantify savings scenarios (vendor substitution, pack
      size changes, fat/sugar blends) on margin impact per SKU.
    - >-
      New product development can’t quickly simulate line feasibility and margin
      at target volumes with realistic yields and labor/overhead loads.
  solution:
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box data connectors to common ERPs/MES (SAP B1, Dynamics 365
      BC/FO, NetSuite, Epicor, Infor; Ignition/Wonderware) to auto-sync BOMs,
      routings, purchase price history, work orders, and waste.
    - >-
      Confectionery-specific digital twin of each recipe/line: models tempering,
      enrobing pickup %, shell thickness, inclusions, changeover loss, rework,
      cooling losses, and packaging scrap.
    - >-
      Real-time cost rollups per batch/SKU, including materials, labor,
      overhead, and yield-adjusted usage; margin waterfall from list price to
      net.
    - >-
      Scenario engine: simulate 5–50% raw price spikes, vendor switches,
      formulation tweaks (fat content, sugar blends), and line parameter changes
      to quantify margin impact before executing.
    - >-
      AI recommendations: priority-ranked actions (e.g., reduce enrober curtain
      by 0.2 mm on SKU X; switch to Vendor B pack film) with expected $/year
      impact and confidence range.
    - >-
      Alerts and guardrails: notify when forecasted margin for a SKU/order falls
      below thresholds; suggest price updates or run plan changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, SKU-level margin intelligence and what-if simulation
    purpose-built for confectionery lines using purchased chocolate—detect
    margin erosion within hours, simulate commodity price swings and yield
    improvements, and recommend actions that lift gross margin by 1.5–4.0
    percentage points within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary confectionery yield models and parameter libraries calibrated
    across multiple enrobing/tempering platforms, enabling accurate simulations
    from day one; integrated margin waterfall tying procurement, operations, and
    pricing in one tool; anonymized benchmarking that improves recommendations
    and is difficult for generalist costing tools or ERPs to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Confectionery manufacturers buying chocolate who need real-time recipe
    costing, yield insight, and margin control across SKUs.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile cocoa/ingredient prices, variable yields, complex BOMs,
    and spreadsheet chaos. Internal: uncertainty about true unit costs and where
    margins leak. Philosophical: makers shouldn’t have to guess profitability to
    craft great chocolate.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we know enrobing pick-up, shell thickness, temper loss, and
    decorative waste make costs slippery. Authority: an AI model tuned for
    confectionery, transparent calculations aligned with standard costing, and
    optional ERP/MES integration.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect ERP/purchasing/production data. 2) Map recipes, pack
    sizes, and yield factors. 3) Auto-calc cost/unit and margin per SKU. 4)
    Simulate material price changes and yield improvements. 5) Monitor, alert,
    and optimize. Agreement: clear data ownership, pilot-first onboarding, and
    exportable results.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a demo and start a 4-week pilot on your top SKUs.
    Transitional: Get a sample scenario report and costing template.
  success: >-
    Know exact cost/unit and margin by SKU and run size; price with confidence;
    prioritize high-impact yield fixes; negotiate ingredient buys with facts;
    protect margins during price swings; align Ops, R&D, and Finance on one
    source of truth.
  failure: >-
    Carry hidden losses into every batch; react too late to cocoa spikes; set
    wrong prices; waste chocolate in scrap and rework; rely on brittle
    spreadsheets; miss easy margin wins.
