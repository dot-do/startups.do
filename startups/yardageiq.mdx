  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers lose sales because customers can’t easily match patterns with
      suitable fabrics, notions, and correct yardage online or in-store without
      expert help.
    - >-
      Staff time is spent on repetitive consultations (pattern recommendations,
      yardage math, substitutions), causing long wait times and abandoned
      purchases.
    - >-
      Inaccurate yardage estimates lead to returns, waste, and customer
      dissatisfaction; most calculators aren’t inventory-aware or
      pattern-specific.
    - >-
      E-commerce discovery for fabrics and patterns is poor (filters don’t
      capture drape, stretch, nap, print scale, repeat), hurting conversion and
      AOV.
    - >-
      Independent retailers lack resources to build/maintain integrations
      between POS/e-commerce, pattern catalogs, and recommendation engines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Embed a customer-facing chat on web/mobile and in-store kiosks that asks
      for project intent, size, skill level, and style preferences.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware recommendations: rank patterns and compatible fabrics
      based on drape, stretch, fiber, width, print repeat/scale, nap, and
      availability.
    - >-
      Deterministic yardage engine: compute yardage for selected pattern
      size/view with match allowances, shrinkage, directional prints, nap, and
      interfacing/lining; add safety margins by config.
    - >-
      Instant cart builder: add fabric yardage, pattern (paper/PDF), and
      notions/thread to retailer’s cart with variant and quantity precision.
    - >-
      Staff Assist mode: lets associates scan a bolt or pattern, get yardage and
      compatible matches fast; supports barcode scanning and camera-based print
      detection.
    - >-
      Analytics and A/B testing: track session-to-cart conversion, AOV uplift,
      attach rates, and consult time saved; export to POS/BI.
    - >-
      Integrations: POS/e-comm (Shopify/WooCommerce/Lightspeed/Square), pattern
      catalogs, distributor feeds, and inventory systems.
    - >-
      Safety & trust: deterministic calculator with test suites,
      retailer-configurable tolerances, guardrails against hallucinations, and
      optional accuracy guarantee credits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Conversational pattern and fabric expert that knows your inventory,
    calculates accurate yardage for any size/view with print-matching, and
    builds ready-to-checkout carts—boosting conversion 10–20%, AOV 12–25%, and
    cutting staff consult time in half.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deterministic, audited yardage engine tied to real inventory and pattern
    specs, plus a growing, licensed dataset of pattern parameters and fabric
    attributes. As more retailers onboard, the system gains unique compatibility
    mappings, performance data, and substitution outcomes that general-purpose
    chatbots can’t replicate. Accuracy guarantee and partner distribution
    relationships further raise switching costs.
