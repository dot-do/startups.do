  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from failures in wells, separators, tank batteries, and
      field compressors causes lost production and costly truck rolls, with many
      issues detected hours late due to alarm fatigue and sparse field coverage.
    - >-
      SCADA alarm floods and static thresholds generate high false
      positives/negatives in dynamic shale operations (chokes, slugs, paraffin,
      hydrate formation), overwhelming operators and delaying action.
    - >-
      Root cause is often unclear across interconnected assets (well → separator
      → tank battery → compressor), leading to trial-and-error troubleshooting
      and prolonged MTTR.
    - >-
      Existing analytics are generic or asset-siloed; they lack upstream gas
      domain context, causality, and action recommendations that fit field
      procedures and CMMS workflows.
    - >-
      Methane-emitting events (e.g., tank venting, VRU failures, compressor
      blowdowns) are underdetected or underattributed, risking EPA compliance
      penalties and ESG underperformance.
    - >-
      Integration friction with historians/SCADA and lack of edge-resilient
      solutions create deployment delays and cybersecurity concerns.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous, physics-informed anomaly detection on SCADA/historian tags for
      wells, separators, tank batteries, and field compressors (edge or cloud).
    - >-
      Causal graph and failure-mode library tailored to upstream natural gas to
      isolate likely root cause across asset chain and surfaces.
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks with ranked actions (e.g., inspect heater-treater
      temperature control loop; verify VRU suction pressure; adjust choke per
      recommended setpoint band).
    - >-
      Alarm noise management: dynamic thresholds and state-aware suppression to
      reduce nuisance alarms while preserving critical alerts.
    - >-
      Emission-aware analytics: detect venting/flares, VRU outages, thief hatch
      openings; estimate methane-equivalent impact and cost of delay.
    - >-
      Operator cockpit and mobile workflow: integrates with CMMS (SAP
      PM/Maximo), work orders, and MOC; supports offline edge buffering.
    - >-
      SOC 2 Type II-ready security, OT-friendly deployment (Ignition/Kepware
      connectors, AVEVA PI/Aspen IP.21 historians).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect issues earlier, explain why, and tell crews what to do—end-to-end,
    domain-trained anomaly and root-cause intelligence for upstream natural gas
    assets that cuts downtime 20–40%, reduces alarm noise 50–70%, and quantifies
    methane/emission impact for compliance and ESG reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-trained causal models and action playbooks specific to upstream
    natural gas asset chains, with pre-built connectors and edge runtime that
    deploys in weeks—not months—plus a curated incident library mapping SCADA
    patterns to root causes and methane impact, improving with each deployment.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and production teams at Natural Gas Extraction operators (NAICS
    211130) who must keep wells, separators, tank batteries, and compressors
    running safely and profitably with limited staff.
  problem: >-
    External: Intermittent equipment/process issues hide in alarm floods; root
    causes are unclear across hundreds of tags.

    Internal: Teams are stretched thin, reacting late and second-guessing data.

    Philosophical: Your data should clearly tell you what’s wrong and what to
    do—before it costs you uptime, safety, or compliance.
  guide: >-
    We understand 2 a.m. callouts and SCADA alarm fatigue. Our team blends oil &
    gas automation experience with applied AI.

    Authority: Integrates with common historians/SCADA; learns per-asset
    baselines; provides explainable root-cause and action suggestions;
    deployable read-only (on‑prem or VPC) with security best practices.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Read-only gateway to SCADA/historian (e.g., OPC UA/Modbus).
    Choose a pilot set of sites.

    2) Learn: Baseline each tag; map dependencies across wells, separators,
    tanks, compressors.

    3) Act: Real-time anomaly alerts with likely causes and ranked actions in
    your tools (SCADA, email, SMS, Teams/Slack). Weekly review to tune.

    Assurance: No control writes, clear data-privacy terms, and defined SLAs.
  callToAction: |-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute discovery and start a 30‑day pilot.
    Transitional: Download the pilot checklist and ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    - Early detection of leaks, hydrate risks, separator dump failures, tank
    high-levels, sensor drift, compressor suction/discharge issues.

    - Fewer nuisance alarms; faster MTTR; fewer truck rolls; higher uptime and
    throughput; lower OPEX and flaring/venting.

    - Clear, auditable recommendations and post-event reports that support
    compliance and continuous improvement.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing downtime, lost gas, and alarm fatigue that hides real problems.
    - More emergency callouts, safety exposures, and environmental penalties.
    - Valuable data remains noise; teams burn out; production targets slip.
