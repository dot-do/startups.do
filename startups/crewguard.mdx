  problem:
    - >-
      Airlines routinely discover impending duty-time/FTL violations too late
      (often <60 minutes before departure), forcing last‑minute swaps, premium
      pay, and cancellations.
    - >-
      Schedulers juggle complex, evolving rule sets (FAR 117, EASA FTL, CAAC,
      DGAC, CBAs) across fleets, bases, and time zones, increasing human error
      and non-compliance risk.
    - >-
      Crew legality-driven disruptions increase reactionary delays; each minute
      of delay costs airlines roughly USD 60–100 (US DOT ranges; internal
      airline finance often uses USD 70–120/min including knock-on effects).
    - >-
      Existing crew systems primarily check legality deterministically at
      assignment time or near real-time; they rarely predict a future illegality
      risk window caused by upstream delays, curfews, MEL/CDL impacts, or duty
      creep 6–72 hours ahead.
    - >-
      Manual what-if analysis to resolve a legality risk typically takes 10–20
      minutes of scheduler time per event and still may miss optimal,
      cost-minimizing swaps.
    - >-
      Lack of early warning erodes On-Time Performance (OTP D0/A14), inflates
      crew-related cancellations, hotel and deadhead costs, and damages
      passenger experience and brand.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predictive legality risk scoring: ML-driven forecasts of delay, duty
      creep, curfew exposure, and downstream pairing conflicts at leg, duty, and
      trip levels.
    - >-
      Compliant swap generator: Optimization engine produces ranked swap/repair
      options (recrews, re-pairings, split duties, extension eligibility per
      CBA, standbys, reserve call-outs) with compliance proofs and cost/OTP
      impact.
    - >-
      Lead-time alerts: Early warnings delivered at thresholds (e.g., T–48h,
      T–24h, T–6h) to OCC tools and mobile for targeted intervention windows.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: Simulate pairings, legality impacts, and costs before
      committing, with explanations citing rule clauses (FAR 117/EASA FTL/CBA).
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: API/adapter pushes accepted swaps back to crew
      management systems (e.g., Jeppesen, Sabre, NetLine/Crew, AIMS, NAVBLUE)
      for immediate activation and crew notification.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance layer: Full traceability of decisions, rule
      references, and approvals to satisfy regulators and labor audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prevent crew legality-driven disruptions before they happen. CrewGuard AI
    predicts impending duty-time/FTL and CBA breaches 6–72 hours ahead and
    auto-generates compliant, cost-ranked swap options that schedulers can
    execute in one click—improving OTP, reducing cancellations and premium pay,
    and assuring auditable compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously validated, multi-jurisdiction legality engine with embedded
    CBA logic and explainability, combined with real-time predictive risk
    scoring and a swap optimizer pre-integrated with leading CMS platforms.
    Early partnerships and audit-grade traceability reduce buyer risk and
    accelerate adoption compared to generic analytics or in-house tools.
