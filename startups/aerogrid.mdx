leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Aeration is 50–70% of plant electricity use; most plants run conservative
      fixed setpoints and blower schedules, missing 10–25% savings potential.
    - >-
      TOU rates, demand charges, and DR programs are complex; operators lack
      tools to target the lowest-cost hours without risking permit compliance.
    - >-
      SCADA historians store rich data (DO, airflow, ammonia, flows), but plants
      lack analytics to translate data into actionable setpoint changes and DR
      event plans.
    - >-
      Manual M&V for energy projects is time-consuming; utilities require
      auditable savings for incentives and DR payments.
    - >-
      Staff shortages and shift work make consistent optimization difficult;
      knowledge is tribal and not encoded in software.
    - >-
      Integrating optimization with compliance constraints (BOD, NH3-N, TN, TSS)
      and process dynamics is non-trivial; generic energy tools ignore biology
      and hydraulics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an AI advisor that ingests SCADA/historian data and forecasts
      influent load, process response, and electricity prices to recommend
      hourly DO/ammonia setpoints and blower/pump schedules.
    - >-
      Provide DR playbooks with explicit kW targets, start/stop timing, and safe
      depth-of-curtailment by basin/zone, with automatic rollback on constraint
      violations.
    - >-
      Embed compliance guardrails (limits on DO minima, sludge age, ammonia
      breakthrough risk) and simulate predicted effluent outcomes before
      recommending actions.
    - >-
      Integrate tariff engines (TOU, demand, RTP) and DR program rules to
      optimize cost, not just kWh, including demand charge ratchets and
      coincident peaks.
    - >-
      Automate M&V: baseline modeling, savings calculation, and utility-grade
      reports aligned to IPMVP to unlock incentives and verify results.
    - >-
      Offer an operator-friendly interface (web and control room displays) with
      one-click acceptance of daily schedules, event alerts, and what-if
      scenarios.
    - >-
      Optional closed-loop mode via SCADA for safely automating setpoint changes
      with interlocks and fail-safe limits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compliance-safe energy and demand optimization for wastewater aeration:
    day-ahead schedules and real-time DR actions that cut 10–20% kWh and 50–500

    M&V and minimal operator burden.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, compliance-first optimizer trained on multi-plant aeration
    datasets with embedded M&V and tariff intelligence, plus pre-built SCADA
    connectors and DR aggregator partnerships—making us faster to deploy, safer
    to operate, and easier to fund via utility incentives than generic energy
    tools or one-off consulting.
