  problem:
    - >-
      Onboarding for trusts, fiduciaries, and custody accounts is slow (7–30
      days), manual, and error-prone across multi-party structures (settlors,
      trustees, beneficiaries, protectors, signers).
    - >-
      Fragmented tools for ID verification, sanctions/PEP screening, adverse
      media, and document collection increase handoffs and costs.
    - >-
      High false-positive rates (often 30–60%) overwhelm compliance teams and
      delay account opening.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-specific AML rules (FATF, BSA/AML, 5AMLD/6AMLD, MAS 626,
      HKMA, JFSC/GFSC, CIMA, FINMA, DIFC/ADGM) are complex to encode and
      maintain internally.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into UBO and complex ownership/control trees leads to
      missed risks and regulatory findings.
    - >-
      Periodic reviews and continuous monitoring are inconsistent; audit trails
      and explainability are insufficient for regulators.
    - >-
      Inconsistent customer experience for HNW/UHNW, family offices, and
      institutional signers leads to drop-off and poor NPS.
    - >-
      High and variable vendor costs (data checks, IDV, media) with little
      optimization or deduplication.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-guided onboarding workflows for trustees, settlors, beneficiaries,
      protectors, and authorized signers with dynamic questioning by role and
      jurisdiction.
    - >-
      Integrated identity verification (document + liveness + PEP/sanctions name
      matching) with configurable vendors and risk thresholds.
    - >-
      Sanctions/PEP/adverse media screening with NLP-based disambiguation and
      summarization, and explainable match scoring.
    - >-
      Automated UBO and control graphing (multi-layer, cross-jurisdiction) with
      data enrichment and link analysis.
    - >-
      Jurisdictional policy engine encoding FATF-aligned KYC/CDD/EDD
      requirements and local rules; version-controlled and auditor-readable.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring (sanctions, PEP, watchlists, adverse media) with
      periodic review scheduling and change alerts.
    - >-
      Case management with escalation, four-eyes checks, audit trails, and
      API/CSV export for regulators and auditors.
    - >-
      Risk scoring with human-in-the-loop overrides, justification capture, and
      model governance (bias/robustness).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-guided, regulator-aligned onboarding and KYC/AML screening purpose-built
    for trust, fiduciary, and custody activities that reduces onboarding time by

    control in minutes, and delivers explainable, audit-ready risk decisions
    with continuous monitoring.

  problem: >-
    Fragmented KYC/AML checks, manual document handling, and shifting
    regulations slow onboarding and raise risk; teams fear fines, lost clients,
    and reputational damage; verifying good parties while blocking bad actors
    should be simpler.

    We understand regulated onboarding pressures and audit scrutiny; our AI
    service streamlines the process with identity verification,
    sanctions/PEP/adverse media screening, and risk scoring, supported by clear
    evidence, privacy-by-design controls, and full audit logs.
  plan: >-
    Connect policies and data sources; launch AI-guided workflows for each
    party; screen, score, and approve with continuous monitoring and
    auto-generated audit trails.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo, or start a low-risk pilot in a secure sandbox with
    your policies and watchlists.
  success: >-
    Faster onboarding, fewer false positives, consistent decisions, and
    audit-ready evidence; happier clients, confident compliance, and scalable
    growth.
