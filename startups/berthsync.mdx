leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Hurry-up-and-wait inefficiency: Vessels frequently speed to arrive early
      and then wait at anchorage. On many trades 15–30% of port time is spent
      waiting, causing avoidable fuel burn and CO2 from sailing too fast.
    - >-
      Berth window misses and variability: Operators lack reliable,
      continuously-updated ETA and berth window alignment. Result: increased
      idle time, schedule knock-on effects, and demurrage/detention exposure.
    - >-
      Rising carbon and fuel costs: Fuel is 50–70% of voyage OPEX; ETS and CII
      add cost/constraints. Each ton of fuel emits ~3.114 tCO2. ETS exposure
      (EU) adds ~$70–90 per tCO2 on covered legs, turning optimization into
      direct cash savings.
    - >-
      Fragmented data and manual workflows: ETA, weather, currents, port
      congestion, and terminal plans are scattered. Operators rely on static
      plans, noon reports, and generic weather routing that ignore live berth
      availability.
    - >-
      Misaligned incentives and constraints: Charterparty laycans, RTA policies,
      and terminal visibility are not integrated into speed planning, leading to
      conservative buffers and suboptimal decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      High-accuracy, continuously-updated ETA with confidence bands using AIS,
      weather, currents, traffic, and port congestion signals.
    - >-
      Berth window forecasting: Predicts realistic Earliest/Latest Time of
      Berthing (ETB) from terminal plans, vessel queue, and operational
      disruptions; aligns ETA to the most probable service start.
    - >-
      Prescriptive speed optimization: Real-time, constraint-aware advice to
      speed up/slow down to hit the target window at minimum fuel/CO2,
      respecting safety, charterparty laycan, draft, ECA fuel rules, and engine
      curves.
    - >-
      Scenario engine: Trade-offs between time, fuel, CO2, ETS cost, and CII
      impact; runs what-if routes, speeds, and port sequencing.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: APIs and UI integrated into voyage management
      systems; alerts to ops desks, masters, and terminals; audit trail for
      compliance (SEEMP III/JIT).
    - >-
      Feedback loop and learning: Per-vessel digital twins calibrated with noon
      reports/sensor data; model continuously improves with voyage outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn hurry-up-and-wait into Just-In-Time arrivals. BerthSync AI continuously
    predicts ETA, forecasts berth window availability, and prescribes optimal
    speed profiles to meet the window with the least fuel/CO2—improving schedule
    reliability while cutting fuel and ETS cost.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Terminal-collaboration layer that ingests and predicts berth windows (not
    just ETAs), plus per-vessel digital twins calibrated with real outcomes. As
    data-sharing MoUs with terminals/PCS expand, we achieve unique visibility
    into service start times, producing superior window adherence and verifiable
    savings that general ETA or routing tools cannot match.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Fleet operations managers, voyage planners, and captains in deep‑sea freight
    who want to hit berth windows precisely while minimizing fuel and CO2.
  problem: >-
    Uncertain ETAs, shifting berth windows, weather, and congestion make
    arrivals risky. To avoid being late, ships over‑speed then wait at anchor,
    wasting fuel, CO2, and money. Meeting the window should be predictable, not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of port schedules, fuel bills, and emissions
    targets. Our maritime ops and AI team built a continuous ETA and speed
    advice service that uses AIS, weather, vessel particulars, and port data,
    and integrates with existing planning and bridge tools.
  plan: >-
    Connect AIS, schedules, weather, and vessel data. Receive continuous ETA
    forecasts and optimal speed up or slow down profiles to meet berth windows
    at minimum fuel and CO2. Act on reforecasts and alerts via dashboards or
    API.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo and scope a pilot on selected lanes. Download the ROI and
    emissions brief for stakeholders.
  success: >-
    On time arrivals without rush steaming, fewer anchorage hours, lower bunker
    spend and CO2, stronger schedule reliability, happier customers and ports,
    and auditable performance.
  failure: >-
    Missed berth windows, anchorage delays, rush steaming, excess fuel and
    emissions, penalties, unhappy customers, and ongoing operational stress.
