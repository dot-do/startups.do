  risks:
    - Specs misunderstood from drawings leading to misquote
    - Out-of-date pricebooks or supplier lead-times
    - Liability for pricing errors—require approval gates
  dependencies:

    - Product configuration rules and historical quotes
    - Security-approved file storage
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as multi-page PDFs/DWGs; manual takeoff and spreadsheet
      pricing create 1–3 day quote cycles and frequent backlogs
    - >-
      Experienced estimators are scarce; labor cost per RFQ is high (2–6 hours
      each) leading to missed bid deadlines and lower throughput
    - >-
      BOM errors and omissions (hardware sets, gaskets, finishes, fasteners)
      cause change orders and margin leakage (2–5% of project value)
    - >-
      Lead-time promises are inconsistent, not tied to supplier lead times or
      shop capacity, causing schedule slips and liquidated damages risk
    - >-
      Pricing is inconsistent across estimators; tribal knowledge is not
      captured in a reusable rules library
    - >-
      Poor traceability across revisions; assumptions/exclusions are not
      standardized, hurting professionalism and increasing dispute risk
    - >-
      Data is siloed; estimates don’t flow cleanly into ERP/MRP/CRM causing
      re-entry, delays, and errors
    - >-
      Small to mid-market fabricators lack IT resources to integrate drawing
      takeoff, costing, and quoting into one repeatable workflow
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parsing of PDFs/DWGs/IFC: detect elevations, opening schedules, door
      schedules, mullions/transoms, panel sizes, glazing types/thickness, finish
      notes, and hardware sets
    - >-
      Automated BOM builder: extrusions (by system), glass, hardware, gaskets,
      sealants, fasteners, anchors, fabrication steps; quantity takeoff with
      waste factors
    - >-
      Costing engine: material pricing via live supplier
      catalogs/EDI/email-quote parsing; labor hours from parametric rules
      (cut/drill/assemble/pack); overhead and freight; target margin with risk
      adjustments
    - >-
      Lead-time estimator: combines supplier lead times (aluminum, glass,
      coatings) with in-house capacity calendar and queue; outputs
      best-case/most-likely/commit windows
    - >-
      Quote generator: branded proposal with inclusions/exclusions,
      clarifications, alternates (value engineering options), payment terms, and
      revision tracking
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: confidence heatmap, discrepancy flags (missing
      hardware sets, ambiguous glazing), one-click edits, and versioning
    - >-
      Integrations: push accepted quotes to ERP/MRP job, create CRM
      opportunity/quote, sync supplier RFQs; eSignature to convert to order
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: compare awarded-job actuals to estimates; retrain
      models and recalibrate rules to reduce variance over time
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, consistent quotes for metal windows and doors: parse
    RFQs/drawings, auto-build a complete BOM, price materials and labor with
    vendor-aware rules, propose realistic lead times tied to capacity and
    suppliers, and output a polished, customer-ready quote with documented
    assumptions—integrated to your ERP/CRM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, fenestration-specific dataset and rules library spanning
    multiple aluminum systems and hardware sets; live supplier pricing/lead-time
    partnerships; closed-loop learning from awarded jobs to as-built actuals;
    deep ERP integrations and a human-in-the-loop review UX that delivers

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Estimators, project managers, and sales leaders at metal window and door
    manufacturers who need to turn complex RFQs into accurate, competitive
    quotes fast without sacrificing margin.
  problem: >-
    Manual takeoffs and pricing from PDFs/drawings are slow and error-prone;
    supplier volatility and inconsistent assumptions cause missed deadlines,
    rework, and margin leakage—when quoting should be fast, consistent, and
    confident.
  guide: >-
    A domain-tuned AI built for metal windows and doors that parses RFQs and
    drawings, builds the BOM, prices materials and labor, proposes lead time,
    and outputs a customer-ready quote with clear assumptions—secure, auditable,
    and aligned to your shop standards.
  plan: >-
    1 Connect RFQ sources and standards. 2 Configure pricing rules, labor rates,
    suppliers, and lead-time logic. 3 Review exceptions; approve AI-generated
    BOM, cost, lead time, and quote with assumptions. 4 Send proposal and learn
    from outcomes for continuous accuracy.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo and upload sample RFQs for a free benchmark; start a pilot to go
    from inbox to quote with confidence.
  success: >-
    Fast, consistent quoting; accurate BOMs and costs; clear assumptions and
    audit trail; reliable lead times; protected margins and higher hit rates;
    more capacity for engineering and selling.
  failure: >-
    Continue drowning in manual takeoffs, miss bid windows, introduce errors and
    chargebacks, erode margins, and burn out the team while competitors respond
    faster.
