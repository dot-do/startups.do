leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Forecast accuracy at SKU/size level is poor (typical WMAPE 25–40%) due to
      volatile construction/auto demand and long lead times.
    - >-
      Production plans are often infeasible: furnace/line capacities, campaign
      rules (thickness/color/coating), cutting patterns, and cold-repair
      downtimes are not fully modeled in Excel or generic APS tools.
    - >-
      High changeover time and scrap from suboptimal campaign sequencing (10–20%
      of available line time lost to changeovers on many plants).
    - >-
      Inventory imbalance: overstocks of slow-moving sizes and stockouts of fast
      movers; inventory turns stagnate at 4–6 with OTIF below 92%.
    - >-
      Planning cycles are slow (2–5 days per monthly S&OP), limiting scenario
      analysis and agility during demand swings.
    - >-
      Siloed processes between sales, planning, and plant operations lead to
      late expedites, premium freight, and missed service levels.
    - >-
      Existing tools lack glass-specific constraints (coater recipes, thickness
      jumps, tint changes, annealed vs. tempered flows) and require heavy manual
      maintenance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and normalization from ERP/MES (orders, shipments, BOM,
      routings, capacity calendars, maintenance windows), historians
      (temperatures, speeds), and market signals (construction permits, auto
      build schedules).
    - >-
      Probabilistic hierarchical forecasting (SKU-size → SKU → product family →
      region → total) with bias control; incorporates exogenous drivers
      (seasonality, macro indicators) and customer-level patterns.
    - >-
      Constrained production planning using MILP/CP optimization: furnace TPD
      capacities, campaign rules (thickness/tint/coat), changeover matrices,
      cutting yields, coater recipe sequencing, cold repair schedules, and labor
      shifts.
    - >-
      Scenario S&OP: simulate demand shocks, price/lead-time changes,
      maintenance events; quantify service levels, inventory, and line
      utilization impacts in minutes.
    - >-
      Automated safety stock and buffer positioning using service-level
      optimization (newsvendor and multi-echelon heuristics).
    - >-
      Collaborative workflows: consensus demand review, supply review, and
      executive S&OP with audit trails and role-based access; what-if sandboxes
      for planners.
    - >-
      APIs to push plans back to ERP/MES/APS (SAP, Oracle, Blue Yonder, Kinaxis,
      o9); alerting for plan violations and re-optimization triggers.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: monitor forecast error, plan adherence,
      changeover actuals; self-tune models and constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An industry-trained AI that forecasts SKU/size demand and automatically
    produces a capacity- and changeover-feasible production plan aligned to your
    furnaces and lines—cutting planning time from days to hours, improving OTIF

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and S&OP leaders at flat glass manufacturers who must keep OTIF
    promises while maximizing furnace pull and minimizing changeovers and cost.
  problem: >-
    Volatile SKU/size mix and short‑notice orders meet rigid furnaces and
    expensive changeovers; spreadsheet planning keeps teams reactive—driving
    stockouts, excess WIP, missed OTIF, and margin erosion.
  guide: >-
    Demand Forecasting & S&OP Co‑pilot: an AI planner built by glass
    manufacturing and S&OP experts. It understands furnace, lehr, cutting, rack,
    and changeover realities; transparent, auditable, and human‑in‑the‑loop.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: integrate orders, shipments, inventory, calendars, SKU/size
    catalog, furnace/line capacities, and changeover matrices. 2) Calibrate:
    train demand models, encode constraints, simulate scenarios, and align
    policies in a pilot. 3) Operate: publish rolling forecasts and a constrained
    13‑week plan by furnace/line/size; run daily replans and what‑ifs; review in
    S&OP. Commitments: data security, model transparency, human overrides,
    measurable ROI.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute discovery; share a sample dataset; receive a baseline
    forecast and trial constrained plan within 2–3 weeks.
  success: >-
    A plan everyone trusts: higher furnace utilization, fewer changeovers,
    toward 98%+ OTIF, lower inventory and expedites, stable schedules, and
    improved margin.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting—stockouts, hot runs, overtime and scrap, idle or
    overloaded lines, unhappy customers, and shrinking margins.
