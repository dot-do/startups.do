leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-mix/short-run orders create excessive sequence-dependent changeovers
      on slitters, sheeters, and die-cutters, inflating setup time by 15–35% of
      scheduled hours.
    - >-
      Manual Excel/whiteboard scheduling struggles with multi-constraint
      realities (operator skills, tooling availability, knife setups,
      grade/coating/color compatibility), leading to frequent rework and
      expediting.
    - >-
      Poor schedule stability causes 10–25% of orders to miss original promise
      dates, driving penalty fees and lost customer trust.
    - >-
      Overtime and weekend work are used as a pressure valve, adding 8–20% labor
      cost variability and eroding margins.
    - >-
      Schedules do not consider true setup matrices (e.g., paper grade to grade,
      width families, adhesive/ink clean-down), leading to unnecessary setups
      and additional scrap.
    - >-
      Reactive hot-order insertion cascades across cells, causing WIP pileups
      and starving/overfeeding downstream equipment.
    - >-
      Planner dependency risk: when a single expert is out, performance degrades
      and tribal knowledge isn’t captured.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MES APS modules are generic, difficult to tune for converting
      nuances, or too heavy to deploy, resulting in low adoption.
    - >-
      Lack of what-if simulation makes it hard to evaluate options for splitting
      lots, overtime usage, partial shipments, or alternate routing.
    - >-
      Unclear KPIs and feedback loops between plan and actual prevent continuous
      improvement of setup matrices and run-rate standards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Auto-build daily/weekly finite schedules that honor machine calendars,
      labor shifts, skill certifications, tooling/knife availability, and
      sequence-dependent setup matrices (grade, width, coating/ink, substrate).
    - >-
      Optimization engine combines mixed-integer programming with domain
      heuristics (family batching, minimal setup paths, cut-width compatibility)
      to minimize changeovers, lateness, and cost of overtime/expedite.
    - >-
      Live re-optimization when rush orders, breakdowns, or material delays
      occur; protects frozen windows to avoid shop-floor chaos.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox for planners: simulate overtime, alternate routings, lot
      splitting, or partial ship promises with instant KPI impacts.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: compare planned vs. actual to refine run rates,
      setup times, and changeover penalties automatically.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box connectors to common ERPs/MES (e.g., SAP, Infor, Epicor,
      Microsoft Dynamics) and machine/PLC signals for status and completion
      feedback.
    - >-
      Shop-floor execution views (tablet/TV) with sequence, setup checklist, and
      tooling notes; easy drag-drop with constraint-aware warnings.
    - >-
      Governance: lock/freeze windows, priority rules, due-date and
      customer-class SLAs, and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI scheduler for paper converting cells that automatically
    generates stable, finite, multi-constraint schedules that cut changeovers,
    lateness, and overtime—deployable in weeks with measurable ROI within one
    quarter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, empirically tuned changeover matrices and heuristics for
    slitters/sheeters/die-cutters, combined with a closed-loop learning pipeline
    that continuously refines setup and run-rate parameters from
    actuals—delivering faster time-to-value and more stable schedules than
    generic APS tools.
