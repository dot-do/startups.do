  problem:
    - >-
      Weather and soil variability create narrow, hard-to-predict windows for
      soil prep and planting, leading to missed opportunities, replanting, and
      yield loss.
    - >-
      Farmers rely on generic forecasts and rules of thumb; field-level soil
      temperature/moisture and crop-specific thresholds are rarely integrated
      into a simple, daily decision-support workflow.
    - >-
      Poor timing drives compaction, seedling disease risk, crusting, and uneven
      emergence, causing 2–6% yield penalties and 2–10% replant rates in row
      crops.
    - >-
      Scheduling people and equipment without clear, ranked windows causes idle
      time or rushed operations, elevating cost per acre and overtime.
    - >-
      Existing tools send weather data but do not convert it into field-specific
      “go/no-go” ratings or quantified risk scores with alerts.
    - >-
      Connectivity constraints (poor cell coverage) and multi-language crews
      limit adoption of complex, app-only tools.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest hyperlocal forecast (nowcast + 14-day) and historical weather, soil
      temperature/moisture (sensors + modeled), and crop-specific thresholds
      (e.g., GDU for emergence, soil trafficability, disease risk).
    - >-
      Generate field-level readiness and risk scores for soil preparation,
      planting, and early cultivation windows; rank days and intra-day slots
      (AM/PM) with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Deliver proactive alerts (SMS, push, email) when a window opens/closes or
      crosses user-defined thresholds; offline-friendly SMS for low-connectivity
      fields.
    - >-
      Offer a scheduling board that turns windows into task assignments by
      field, crew, and implement; integrates with operations software (e.g.,
      John Deere Operations Center, Trimble).
    - >-
      Provide post-event analysis that compares actual outcomes (emergence rate,
      replant incidents) vs. suggested windows for continuous model calibration
      and ROI tracking.
    - >-
      Enable calibration by crop/variety, soil type, drainage, tillage practice,
      and planting depth/row unit downforce to tailor thresholds to each
      operation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-specific, daily-ranked planting and soil prep windows with quantified
    risk scores and alerts that integrate forecast, soil temp/moisture, and
    crop-specific thresholds—reducing replant by 20–40%, improving stand
    uniformity, and increasing planted-on-time acres while simplifying crew and
    equipment scheduling.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feedback loop linking predicted windows to measured field outcomes at
    scale, building a unique, labeled dataset by crop/soil/region; embedded
    distribution via OEMs and retailers; and an offline-first alerting workflow
    that fits real-world field operations better than app-only competitors.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Farm managers, growers, and agronomists who must choose the best day and
    field to prep soil, plant, and cultivate—maximizing emergence and timing
    while minimizing risk and wasted passes.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile forecasts, cold/wet soils, and logistics make the
    “right window” a moving target.

    - Internal: Decision fatigue and second-guessing threaten narrow planting
    windows.

    - Philosophical: With good data available, farmers shouldn’t have to gamble
    on timing.
  guide: >-
    We understand one bad timing call can cost a season. Planting Window
    Optimizer combines hyperlocal forecasts, soil temperature/moisture, and
    crop-specific thresholds to rank daily windows across soil prep, planting,
    and cultivating. Built with agronomists, explains why a day scores high/low,
    and learns from your field history.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect your fields, crops, and data sources (weather, probes, stations).

    2) Set thresholds or use crop templates; choose operations
    (prep/plant/cultivate).

    3) Receive daily ranked windows and push alerts with clear reasoning.

    Agreement plan:

    - Your data stays yours; private and exportable.

    - You control thresholds and notifications.

    - Recommendations support—never replace—your judgment.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial and onboard your first field in 15 minutes.

    Transitional: Download a sample window report and subscribe for localized
    tips.
  success: |-
    - Plant on the best days for even emergence and strong stands.
    - Reduce compaction and replant risk; optimize fuel, labor, and equipment.
    - Hit maturity targets more consistently; schedule crews with confidence.
    - Sleep better knowing you won’t miss the window.
  failure: >-
    Avoid mudding in, seed rot after a cold rain, crusting, stand loss from late
    frost, wasted fuel/overtime, prevent-plant acreage, and costly rework due to
    poorly timed operations.
