  problem:
    - >-
      Late detection of quality drift (basis weight, moisture, caliper,
      formation) causes off-grade rolls and customer claims; mills often
      discover issues hours after they start due to slow lab cycles and noisy
      SPC charts.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis is manual, slow, and inconsistent; engineers sift
      through hundreds of tags and lab results with limited multivariate tools,
      leading to extended troubleshooting and production losses.
    - >-
      Alarm floods and single-variable SPC miss multivariate interactions (e.g.,
      steam box, headbox consistency, dryer section interactions), resulting in
      false negatives and operator fatigue.
    - >-
      Grade changes and furnish/recipe adjustments create transient instability;
      mills lack playbooks with predictive guardrails to shorten stabilization
      time.
    - >-
      Siloed data (QCS, DCS, PI historian, LIMS) and missing context (grade,
      basis weight targets, setpoint changes, maintenance events) slow analysis
      and learning.
    - >-
      Yield loss of 0.5–2.0% and energy/chemical overuse are common; at
      $600–1,000/ton and 300–600 t/day machines, this is $200k–$1.2M/year per
      machine in avoidable cost.
    - >-
      Quality claims and rework (0.1–0.5% of sales) damage customer
      relationships and tie up cash.
    - >-
      Mills lack in-house data science bandwidth to build, validate, and
      maintain robust multivariate models tailored to papermaking processes.

      adjustments, maintenance checks, or grade-change guardrails, with expected
      impact and risk score.
