  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ-to-quote cycle times are slow (often 24–72 hours) due to manual
      parsing of emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, and dielines (CF2/DXF/PDF).
    - >-
      Quoting accuracy depends on tribal knowledge of estimators; turnover or
      absence creates bottlenecks and inconsistent margins.
    - >-
      Determining optimal layout (n-up, rotation, grain, trims, waste) across
      available sheet and press sizes is time-consuming and prone to suboptimal
      yields (1–3% material waste).
    - >-
      Routing decisions across presses, die-cutters, folder-gluers, and optional
      stations (windowing, foil, emboss) are inconsistent; machine availability
      and setup times are not systematically optimized.
    - >-
      Existing MIS/ERP estimating modules require extensive manual data entry
      and don’t read dielines, causing rekeying errors and slow throughput.
    - >-
      Missed RFQs or delayed responses reduce hit rates vs. faster competitors,
      especially for brokers demanding same-day quotes.
    - >-
      Cost variance between quoted and actual (post-job costing) is high
      (±8–12%) due to inaccurate makeready, run speeds, and changeover
      assumptions.
    - >-
      Estimators spend significant time on non-value-add tasks (file hunting,
      spec clarification, duplicate data entry) rather than pricing strategy and
      customer communication.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified RFQ intake: auto-ingest from email inboxes and portals; NLP
      extracts specs (dimensions, board, caliper, colors, coatings, qty breaks,
      delivery terms).
    - >-
      Dieline analysis: parse CF2/DXF/PDF to detect cut/crease, blank size,
      perimeter/crease length, panel geometry, and nesting constraints; detect
      windows/holes/embellishments.
    - >-
      Auto layout/yields: compute optimal n-up across available sheet sizes and
      presses with grain/bleed/trim rules; simulate multiple layouts and choose
      highest contribution margin.
    - >-
      Routing engine: recommend equipment sequence (press, coater, die-cutter,
      stripper/blanker, folder-gluer, specialty ops) with setup/run time
      estimates based on machine library and historical actuals.
    - >-
      Costing and margin rules: materials (SBS/CCNB/Kraft), inks/coatings,
      tooling amortization, makeready, run rates; apply customer/product margin
      floors, rounding, and discount policies.
    - >-
      Quote composer: generate branded quote PDFs and emails with line-item
      breakdowns, alternates (board options, qty breaks), lead time, and
      validity; auto-log to CRM.
    - >-
      ERP/MIS integration: push BOM/routing to systems like EFI Radius/Packaging
      Suite, Aptean, PrintVis (BC), Amtech; pull price lists, machine rates, and
      inventory.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: compare quoted vs. actuals to tune speeds, setup
      times, and waste assumptions; learn customer-specific win/loss drivers.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit: maintain a rule audit trail; SOC 2-oriented logging;
      role-based approvals for margin exceptions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From RFQ to a costed, routable, ERP-ready quote in under 30 minutes: AI
    parses specs and dielines, optimizes yields and routing, and enforces margin
    rules—boosting hit rates while protecting profitability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built dieline geometry and layout optimization engine trained on
    packaging-specific datasets, combined with governed learning from post-job
    actuals—delivering continuously improving yield, speed, and margin control
    that generic RPA/MIS estimators cannot match.

    Estimators and sales teams at folding-carton manufacturers (NAICS 322219)
    who want to turn mixed‑format RFQs and dielines into fast, accurate,
    profitable quotes.
  problem: >-
    Manual quoting is slow and error‑prone—hand‑parsing dielines, calculating
    impositions/yields, building routings/BOMs, and applying margin rules across
    presses and finishing. The result: delayed responses, under‑quoting, margin
    leakage, and lost bids.
  guide: >-
    We understand RFQ chaos. Built by packaging engineers and pricing leaders,
    our AI reads RFQs and CAD dielines, models press/finishing constraints, and
    standardizes costing—integrating with your MIS/ERP for seamless handoff.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your RFQ inbox and MIS/ERP. 2) Upload or auto‑ingest RFQs and
    dielines (PDF/AI/DXF/CF2). 3) Receive a costed quote with routing,
    imposition, yields, waste, and margin rules—review, tweak, and send in
    minutes.

  success: >-
    Quotes in minutes; higher win rates; protected margins; standardized costing
    across plants; reduced estimator workload; clean audit trail; faster, more
    confident pricing.
  failure: >-
    Slow, inconsistent quoting; mis‑spec’d jobs; under‑quoted work; margin
    erosion; estimator burnout; lost customers and revenue.
