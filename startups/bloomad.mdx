leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Owners spend 6–10 hours/month manually creating and tuning Google + Meta
      ads; most lack channel expertise, leading to inefficient spend.
    - >-
      Local intent queries (e.g., “flower delivery near me”, “same‑day roses
      [city]”) are competitive; CPCs range $2–$8 in mid‑sized US metros, causing
      wasted budget without tight geo/keyword controls.
    - >-
      Inventory and seasonality (Valentine’s, Mother’s Day, funerals, weddings)
      change weekly; most florists don’t update ads/creatives accordingly,
      depressing CTR and relevance scores.
    - >-
      30–50% of orders are placed by phone; without call tracking and offline
      conversion import, true ROAS is underreported and optimization is misled.
    - >-
      Poor geo‑targeting (too wide radii, wrong ZIPs) increases unprofitable
      deliveries; delivery fees and margin by distance aren’t factored into
      bids.
    - >-
      Limited on-site conversion tracking (no GA4, Meta Pixel issues, slow
      sites) reduces algorithmic learning and inflates CAC.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (POS/e‑commerce separate from ads) prevent product feed
      ads (price/availability), dynamic retargeting, and occasion-specific
      creatives.
    - >-
      Seasonal budget misallocation (over/underspend in peak weeks) misses
      demand spikes; pacing and dayparting are rarely used.
    - >-
      Lack of transparent reporting: owners don’t see orders per channel, CAC
      per occasion, or profit by ZIP, making marketing decisions guesswork.
  solution:
    - >-
      One‑time onboarding wizard: connect Google Ads, Google Business Profile,
      Meta Ads, GA4, and Pixel; import catalog from
      Floranext/BloomNation/Lovingly/Shopify/Woo/Square.
    - >-
      Inventory‑aware ad building: auto‑create Search + Performance Max +
      Shopping (where applicable) and Meta Conversion campaigns using product
      feed (bouquets, prices, images, stock).
    - >-
      Local delivery intelligence: build ZIP/radius targets from your delivery
      zones; profit‑by‑distance scoring influences bids and exclusions.
    - >-
      Occasion playbooks: prebuilt keyword sets, audiences, and creatives for
      Valentine’s, Mother’s Day, Sympathy/Funeral, Birthday, Anniversary, Get
      Well, Weddings; automatic seasonal budget shifts.
    - >-
      Creative automation: generate image/video variants and copy from product
      photos and occasion templates; weekly refresh to prevent fatigue.
    - >-
      Budget pacing + dayparting: smooth spend across weeks with configurable
      caps; increase bids during peak ordering windows (7–11am, 4–7pm local).
    - >-
      Call tracking + offline conversion import: dynamic numbers on site and
      call‑only ads; attribute phone orders to campaigns; feed revenue back to
      Google + Meta.
    - >-
      Landing assist: optional lightweight landing pages per occasion with fast
      load, local trust signals, delivery windows, and one‑click call/text.
    - >-
      Unified reporting: order source, CAC, ROAS, orders by occasion/ZIP,
      impression share, top queries, phone vs. web split; weekly SMS/email
      summaries.
    - >-
      Safety rails: negative keyword libraries, query filtering (e.g., “free”),
      brand‑term protection, ad policy checks, 24/7 autopause on overspend or
      broken tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn-key, florist‑specific AI that auto‑builds, optimizes, and reports
    Google + Meta ads tied to your inventory, delivery zones, and occasions—so
    you get more local orders at a lower CAC in under 15 minutes of setup.
    Targets: 3.0–5.0 ROAS on ads within 60 days in typical markets, 15–30% more
    orders at flat spend via inventory‑aware and seasonality‑aware automation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Florist‑specific data and playbooks: a curated, continually learning dataset
    of search terms, creatives, seasonal demand curves, ZIP‑level profitability,
    and delivery constraints—plus direct POS/e‑commerce integrations enabling
    inventory‑aware ads and offline revenue attribution most generalist tools
    lack.
