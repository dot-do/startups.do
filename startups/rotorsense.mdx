leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on pumps/compressors costs $10k–$1M per day per asset;
      most sites lack early-warning systems that reliably detect emerging
      mechanical faults 7–21 days in advance.
    - >-
      Historian, SCADA/DCS, and CMMS data are siloed; CMMS failure codes are
      inconsistently used, degrading label quality and preventing closed-loop
      learning.
    - >-
      Alarm floods and threshold-only rules create high false positives (>20% of
      alerts not actionable), eroding trust and causing alert fatigue.
    - >-
      Reliability teams are bandwidth constrained; manual vibration analyses are
      periodic, not continuous, and remote/ungauged assets go unmonitored.
    - >-
      Model drift from process changes (throughput, product, ambient) degrades
      predictive accuracy over time without monitoring/governance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors to AVEVA PI, Honeywell PHD, OSI Monarch, CygNet,
      Ignition, OPC UA, and CMMS (SAP PM, IBM Maximo, Infor EAM) for rapid data
      onboarding.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML library for rotating equipment (pumps,
      reciprocating/centrifugal compressors): multi-signal features (flow, head,
      power, vibration/proxy, temperature, suction/discharge pressures) +
      equipment maps/curves.
    - >-
      ISO 14224-aligned failure mode library (e.g., bearing wear, seal failure,
      cavitation, surge, misalignment) with likelihood and confidence scoring;
      explainability shows driving tags and physical rationale.
    - >-
      Action routing: converts alerts into CMMS work orders with recommended job
      plans, spares, and priority based on criticality and production risk;
      mobile/email/MS Teams/Slack notifications.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: uses completed CMMS work order outcomes and
      technician feedback to re-label events, retrain models, and improve
      precision/recall over time.
    - >-
      Edge option for low-bandwidth sites: on-prem/edge gateway for inference
      with store-and-forward, meeting IT/OT security constraints.
    - >-
      Governance: model performance dashboards, drift monitoring, changelogs,
      and MOC workflows to satisfy APM audits and reliability governance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Historian-driven, OEM-agnostic predictive maintenance that converts raw
    PI/SCADA signals and CMMS outcomes into prioritized, explainable alerts with
    likely causes and auto-generated work orders—deployed in weeks, delivering
    7–21 days early warning and 20–40% fewer unplanned failures.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset mapping historian signals to standardized failure codes
    across multiple operators and OEMs, plus physics-informed models and OEM
    FMEA libraries that deliver explainable, actionable alerts integrated
    directly into CMMS work orders—achieving time-to-value in weeks rather than
    months.
