    targets while preserving fairness and regulatory compliance.
  targetUsers:
    - Revenue manager
    - GM/Owner
  triggers:

    - Promo calendar and blackout dates
  steps:
    - Estimate price elasticity per route/departure
    - Simulate price ladders and choose best action (price up/down or promo)

  risks:
    - Regulatory or public backlash to surge pricing
    - Data sparsity on low-frequency routes

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Operators rely on static or seasonal fares set manually, leading to missed
      revenue during peak demand and under-filled off-peak sailings.
    - >-
      High demand volatility driven by weather, events, tourism flows, and
      disruptions makes forecasts inaccurate without advanced models.
    - >-
      Public scrutiny and regulatory constraints (fare caps/floors, concession
      agreements, equity mandates) limit traditional surge pricing tactics.
    - >-
      Limited data science resources; most inland ferry/cruise operators lack
      tools to estimate price elasticity by departure/segment.
    - >-
      Promotions are broad and untargeted, eroding yield and training customers
      to wait for discounts.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (reservation, POS, web/app, OTA) make real-time price
      changes and inventory updates error-prone.
    - >-
      KPIs (load factor, revenue/seat, service accessibility) conflict;
      operators lack multi-objective optimization by departure.
    - >-
      No formal A/B testing or uplift measurement to prove ROI of pricing
      decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting per departure using bookings-on-hand (pickup
      curves), weather, events, holidays, and historical patterns.
    - >-
      Elasticity estimation by route, time-of-day, passenger segment, and
      channel to set optimal prices within regulatory bounds.
    - >-
      Fairness & compliance engine: enforce caps/floors, publish/advance-notice
      rules, price change frequency limits, equity protections (e.g., commuter
      pass invariance, essential departure fairness).
    - >-
      Real-time inventory and price orchestration integrated with
      reservation/POS/OTA channels; conflict resolution and rollback.
    - >-
      Promotion optimizer: targeted offers to low-demand departures and
      price-sensitive segments; cannibalization control.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if simulations (e.g., vessel out-of-service,
      event influx, weather); revenue and load-factor projections.
    - >-
      Explainable recommendations with human-in-the-loop approval and clear
      rationale/audit logs for regulators and boards.
    - >-
      A/B testing and controlled trials per route/departure; revenue attribution
      and uplift reporting.
    - >-
      Ancillary optimization (snacks, tours, seat class, bundles) for applicable
      operators.
    - >-
      Operations-aware constraints: dwell times, boarding limits, ADA capacity,
      minimum service requirements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Dynamic, regulation-aware pricing and promotion optimization by departure
    that lifts revenue 5–10% and improves off-peak load factors 5–12 percentage
    points within one season—while enforcing fairness, auditability, and
    compliance constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Regulation-aware pricing engine purpose-built for ferries/cruises with
    explainable AI, auditable policies, and pre-built integrations to leading
    ferry reservation systems—plus a growing cross-operator demand signal
    dataset that improves forecasts while preserving data privacy.
