  problem:
    - >-
      Manual concrete takeoffs from 2D plans consume 6–12 hours per mid-size
      project (50–150 pages), creating bottlenecks that cause missed bid
      deadlines and slow quote turnaround.
    - >-
      Estimator shortages: most poured-concrete contractors have 1–3 estimators
      who juggle 5–20 bids/week; capacity ceilings cap revenue growth and
      responsiveness to addenda.
    - >-
      Quantity errors and scope gaps lead to margin slippage: 3–8% average
      variance between estimated and actual for concrete, rebar, and formwork;
      misreads of specs (psi, slump, admixtures, vapor barriers, reinforcement
      schedules) are common.
    - >-
      Poor version control and late addenda drive rework; teams spend 1–3 hours
      reconciling plan revisions and alternates per bid.
    - >-
      Fragmented cost data: outdated labor/equipment/productivity rates;
      volatile materials (cement, rebar, admixtures) with regional variance lead
      to inaccurate cost build-ups.
    - >-
      Inconsistent symbology and detail conventions across architects/engineers
      make automation difficult; many tools are general-purpose and not
      concrete-specific.
    - >-
      Limited integration with workflows (Procore, Bluebeam, Autodesk) forces
      double-entry, Excel duct-tape, and error-prone handoffs.
    - >-
      Contractors need defensible, auditable estimates with line-by-line
      assumptions for GC negotiations and VE; most tools lack confidence scores
      and traceability back to plan callouts.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered plan and spec ingestion (PDFs, vector CAD exports) that
      automatically detects slab areas and thicknesses, wall lengths and
      heights, footings/grade beams, piers, joints, embeds, vapor barriers,
      insulation, and rebar schedules.
    - >-
      Spec parsing to extract mix designs, compressive strength, exposure
      classes, cover, fiber vs mesh, admixtures, curing requirements, and
      jointing details, with alerts when specs conflict with plan notes.
    - >-
      Concrete-specific assemblies and cost build-ups: concrete volume and
      waste, rebar by size/spacing/grade with lap/splice logic, formwork surface
      area and cycle times, pumping/placing/finishing labor, sawcutting, curing,
      and QA/QC.
    - >-
      Estimator-in-the-loop workflow: quick review of AI-detected elements with
      side-by-side plan overlays, confidence scores, and one-click corrections
      that retrain project-level models.
    - >-
      Versioning and change reconciliation: compare base set to addenda, cloud
      changes, and alternates; highlight quantity deltas and cost impacts for VE
      options.
    - >-
      Calibrated productivity and cost models by region; import historical
      actuals to tune production rates and labor/equipment crews.
    - >-
      One-click exports to Excel templates, cost codes (CSI 033000), and
      integrations with Procore Estimating, Autodesk Build/Takeoff, Bluebeam
      Revu, and STACK/PlanSwift.
    - >-
      Defensible proposals: generate scope clarifications,
      inclusions/exclusions, and assumption logs with hyperlinks to plan
      callouts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Produce bid-ready concrete takeoffs and cost build-ups in minutes—not
    days—using AI tuned for foundations, slabs, walls, and footings, delivering
    ±3% concrete volume accuracy and ±5% rebar weight accuracy on benchmarked
    sets, with auditable traceability and integrations to the tools concrete
    estimators already use.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A concrete-first AI stack trained on thousands of annotated
    foundation/slab/wall/footing plan sets with linked actuals, yielding
    superior detection of reinforcement and formwork vs. generic takeoff tools;
    estimator-in-the-loop feedback captured at element level to continuously
    improve models; early integrations and co-marketing with Procore/Bluebeam
    plus supplier quote automation create switching costs and a defensible data
    moat.

  character: >-
    Poured-concrete foundation contractors and estimators who need fast,
    reliable takeoffs and costed estimates for slabs, walls, footings, and
    foundations to win more profitable bids.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual plan takeoffs are slow, inconsistent, and miss revisions.
    Internal: Bids feel rushed and risky, and margins feel exposed.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose work or profit because paperwork beats
    production.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to price concrete work accurately on tight
    timelines. Our AI-driven service reads plans and specs for concrete scopes
    and produces quantified, costed line items using field-ready assemblies and
    current cost inputs, so you can bid with confidence.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload plans/specs. 2) Review AI quantities and cost build-up
    for slabs, walls, footings, and foundations. 3) Adjust crews, rates, and
    inclusions; finalize your estimate package. Agreement: Transparent
    calculations and assumptions, with your team in control before submission.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a demo to see your scope estimated. Transitional: Request
    a sample takeoff from a past project.
  success: >-
    Consistently fast, defensible estimates; fewer scope gaps and change orders;
    stronger hit rates; protected margins; more time for field coordination;
    scalable estimating capacity without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning nights on manual takeoffs, miss scope on revisions, over- or
    under-price work, lose winnable bids—or win unprofitable ones—and erode
    trust and margins.
