  problem:
    - >-
      Early-phase sun/shadow, daylight, and view analyses take 8–16 hours per
      design option using manual workflows (Revit/Rhino scripts, imports,
      Radiance/ClimateStudio) and specialist time.
    - >-
      Cities require compliance-ready diagrams and standardized timestamps
      (equinoxes/solstices, specific hours), leading to rework and delays if
      formats are wrong.
    - >-
      Context modeling (terrain, surrounding buildings, view cones, protected
      landmarks) is tedious and error-prone; data sourcing for each city can
      take 1–4 hours per project.
    - >-
      Design teams iterate 5–20 options in schematic design; current tools don’t
      scale for rapid, comparative analysis with audit trails.
    - >-
      Inconsistent assumptions (weather files, material reflectance, grid
      spacing) cause results that vary ±20%, undermining confidence and
      stakeholder trust.
    - >-
      Clients and planning departments expect shareable, visual web reports;
      generating polished outputs adds 1–2 hours per option.
    - >-
      Switching between tools (Revit, Rhino, SketchUp, Grasshopper) introduces
      versioning issues and breaks reproducibility.
    - >-
      Specialist daylight consultants are expensive for conceptual iterations;
      budgets often defer analysis until late stages when changes are costly.
    - >-
      Limited early visibility into view corridor conflicts causes costly
      redesigns during planning review.
    - >-
      Current SaaS options are either energy-model focused or lack city-specific
      compliance templates (e.g., London BRE overshadowing, Vancouver View
      Cones, Sydney Solar Access).
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click cloud analyses directly from Revit/SketchUp/Rhino/IFC with
      auto-ingested 3D city context for major metros.
    - >-
      AI surrogate daylight engine for rapid DF/UDI screening (±10% vs
      Radiance/ClimateStudio benchmarks), plus a ‘high-accuracy’ mode using
      validated engines for submission-grade results.
    - >-
      Regulatory templates: pre-set timestamps, metrics, and report layouts for
      cities (e.g., London BRE overshadowing, Toronto Sun/Shadow, NYC Solar
      Access, Sydney SEPP, Vancouver View Cones, San Francisco sunlight access
      to parks).
    - >-
      View corridor conflicts: detect, quantify % intrusion and angular
      encroachment, and propose massing trims to restore compliance.
    - >-
      Option comparison: batch-run 5–50 variants; visualize deltas in
      overshadowing, DF/UDI, and view impacts with colorized overlays and KPIs.
    - >-
      Shareable web viewer and auto-generated PDF report packs (legends,
      assumptions, time stamps, coordinate systems, north arrow, scale bars).
    - >-
      Versioned audit trail with locked assumptions (weather file, materials,
      reflectance, grid spacing) for reproducibility and review.
    - >-
      Context data pipeline: GIS terrain, OSM/CityGML/municipal LoD2/3 models,
      solar ephemeris, weather files (TMY/EPW).
    - >-
      Team collaboration: comments, markups, and approval gates; export to
      DWG/DXF/IFC images and geo-referenced shapefiles for planning submissions.
    - >-
      API for enterprise workflows and vendor integrations (e.g., data rooms,
      pro forma tools).

  character: >-
    Architects and urban designers who need fast, defensible sun/shadow,
    daylight, and view insights during early design.
  problem: >-
    Manual studies are slow and subjective, causing deadline stress and risking
    missed daylight targets, overshadows, and blocked view corridors.
  guide: >-
    We get the pressure to justify massing early. Our AI has automated thousands
    of studies, aligned with LEED/BREEAM guidance and common local shadow/view
    rules—so you can trust the numbers.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload a massing (Rhino/Revit/SketchUp) or sketch online; set site,
    dates, and constraints.

    2) Run solar/shadow diagrams, preliminary daylight factor/UDI, and view
    corridor analyses with clear heatmaps and metrics.

    3) Compare options, export PDFs/CAD/GeoJSON, and share links for stakeholder
    review.
  callToAction: Start a 14-day pilot and run your first site study in under 10 minutes.
  success: >-
    Confident concepts, faster iterations, clear visuals and metrics, fewer
    redesigns, smoother approvals, and happier clients.
  failure: >-
    Hours lost to manual diagrams, missed constraints, late-stage rework, budget
    overruns, and approval risk on shadow, daylight, or view impacts.
