  problem:
    - >-
      Manual SDS and GHS label authoring is slow (2–6 weeks per SKU) and
      error-prone, delaying product launches and shipments.
    - >-
      Mixture classification rules (GHS/CLP, bridging principles, ATE
      calculations, cut-off limits) are complex and vary by jurisdiction;
      keeping them current is resource-intensive.
    - >-
      Localization into multiple languages (EU, LATAM, APAC) requires
      domain-accurate translation and layout changes, leading to inconsistent
      quality and high costs.
    - >-
      Regulatory updates (e.g., EU CLP ATPs, OSHA HazCom 2012 alignment changes,
      transport ADR/IMDG/IATA updates) are frequent; tracking and propagating
      changes across SDS versions is difficult.
    - >-
      Disparate systems (ERP/PLM/LIMS/EHS) cause data silos; composition changes
      don’t reliably trigger document updates, creating compliance risk.
    - >-
      Lack of clear audit trails makes it hard to pass customer and regulatory
      audits and to demonstrate rule-based decision rationale.
    - >-
      Outsourced authoring costs scale poorly with SKU count and market
      expansion; internal teams struggle to hire/retain regulatory specialists.
  solution:
    - >-
      Configurable rules engine encodes GHS/CLP mixture classification,
      transport classifications, and jurisdictional differences; auto-calculates
      hazard classes, H/P statements, pictograms, and signal words from
      composition.
    - >-
      Explainable AI authoring assistant drafts all 16 SDS sections, citing rule
      sources and calculation steps; human-in-the-loop review with redlines and
      rationale capture.
    - >-
      Localization pipeline with terminology management and translation memory
      specialized for chemical regulatory content; auto-adapts label layouts for
      languages and script direction.
    - >-
      Regulatory content feeds (authoritative lists and vendor databases)
      auto-sync; change detection triggers re-classification and version updates
      with impact assessment.
    - >-
      Connectors to ERP/PLM/LIMS (e.g., SAP, Oracle, QAD) propagate composition
      changes; webhook/API publishes PDFs, XML/JSON, and print-ready labels to
      DAM/label systems.
    - >-
      Distribution features: QR codes for eSDS access, customer portal for SDS
      retrieval, automated email updates to downstream users, and
      archive/versioning with traceability.
    - >-
      Compliance ops dashboard: coverage, update backlog, jurisdictions at risk,
      and time-to-publish metrics; built-in validation checks before release.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Publish audit-ready, jurisdiction-specific 16‑section SDS and GHS labels in
    hours, not weeks—using an explainable rules engine and domain-tuned AI that
    auto-classifies hazards, localizes content into 40+ languages, and keeps
    documents current automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, jurisdiction-aware rules engine coupled with domain-tuned AI
    and a continuously validated regulatory knowledge base; deep integrations
    into ERP/PLM and label ecosystems create high switching costs. Accumulated
    translation memory and decision rationales improve automation quality
    uniquely for each customer over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    EHS/Regulatory Affairs managers, formulators, and label coordinators at
    basic organic chemical manufacturers (NAICS 325199) who want to publish
    accurate, compliant, multilingual SDS and GHS labels quickly, keep them
    current automatically, and integrate the process with existing systems
    across many SKUs and markets.
  problem: >-
    - External: Fragmented and evolving rules (OSHA/CLP/WHMIS/GHS variants),
    many languages and formats, manual error‑prone authoring, scattered data,
    version control headaches.

    - Internal: Anxiety about audits and shipment holds, bandwidth constraints,
    slow time‑to‑market, difficulty maintaining expertise.

    - Philosophical: Compliance should be automatic and transparent so
    scientists can focus on chemistry—not paperwork.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the stress of maintaining thousands of SDS and labels
    while regulations shift and customers demand updates fast.

    - Authority: Purpose‑built GHS rules engine that maps hazards from
    composition, curated regulatory content and phrase libraries, workflows with
    audit trails, and proven integrations with ERP/LIMS/PLM.
  plan: >-
    - Process:
      1) Import compositions/specs via file or API.
      2) Auto‑classify hazards; generate 16‑section SDS and jurisdiction‑specific GHS labels.
      3) Review, redline, and approve with version control.
      4) Publish to PDF/Word/HTML/label templates; sync via API.
      5) Monitor rule changes; auto‑propose revisions with notifications.
      6) Localize to target languages/markets with terminology QA.
    - Agreement: Start a scoped pilot; data stays yours; SLA‑backed support;
    validation checklist; onboarding/training; transparent pricing.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a live workflow demo and import a sample formula; start a
    time‑boxed pilot for selected SKUs.

    - Transitional: Download sample SDS/labels and a GHS readiness checklist;
    subscribe to regulatory change alerts; use the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Always‑current, multilingual SDS and GHS labels; faster launches and
    customer responses; a single source of truth; dramatically reduced manual
    authoring; confident, audit‑ready documentation; seamless ERP/LIMS
    integration; lower compliance risk and cost; scalable global expansion.
