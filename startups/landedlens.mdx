leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheet costing leads to 2–5% landed cost variance vs actuals
      due to duty, freight, and FX volatility.
    - >-
      Costing cycles are slow (3–10 days) because teams manually gather quotes,
      duty tables, and BOM updates across suppliers.
    - >-
      Missed gross margin targets by 1–3 percentage points from late changes
      (MOQ, trims, packaging, CO, routing).
    - >-
      Inconsistent HS code classification and Incoterms handling create
      compliance risk and unexpected charges/chargebacks.
    - >-
      No standardized way to run what-if scenarios (supplier, CO, qty breaks,
      mode, FX, tariff changes) to hit target margin at style/SKU level.
    - >-
      Poor integration between PLM/ERP/freight providers causes duplicate data
      entry and errors in PO creation and vendor negotiations.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into cost drivers across seasons and vendors hampers
      negotiations and continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted BOM ingestion maps items, packaging, and process costs;
      auto-detects HS code candidates by component and country of origin with
      explainability and human-in-the-loop approval.
    - >-
      Rules + optimization engine computes FOB and landed cost by Incoterm
      across duty, brokerage, freight (ocean/air/express), surcharges (GRI,
      BAF), and FX in real time.
    - >-
      What-if simulator to test suppliers, MOQs, qty breaks, routing, modes, CO
      shifts, packaging specs, and FX hedges to meet target margin and price
      points.
    - >-
      Target-margin optimizer proposes actions (e.g., packaging change, supplier
      swap, mode shift) sorted by impact on GM% and lead-time risk.
    - >-
      Variance tracking compares estimates vs actual invoice/PO costs, learning
      to reduce error over time; alerts on deviations beyond thresholds.
    - >-
      Integrated data feeds: FX, surcharges, tariffs/duties; connectors to
      PLM/ERP (Centric, FlexPLM, BlueCherry, NetSuite, Infor, SAP AFS) and to
      freight forwarders.
    - >-
      Governance: approval workflows, audit trails, cost versioning, and change
      logs per style/season/vendor.
    - >-
      Supplier collaboration portal to collect quotes and BOM confirmations;
      standardized cost templates and auto-validation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit target margins with confidence: an AI-driven BOM-to-landed-cost engine
    that automates duty, freight, FX, and MOQ scenarios, delivering ±2%
    first-pass landed cost accuracy and cutting costing cycle time by 50–70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on BOM-to-actual variances across brands and factories
    yields a unique, domain-specific cost graph. Combined with PLM/logistics
    integrations and compliance guardrails, this produces faster, more accurate
    landed-cost scenarios than generic calculators or spreadsheet-based
    workflows.
