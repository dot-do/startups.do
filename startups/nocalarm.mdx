  problem:
    - >-
      NOCs drown in alarm noise: 200k–1M raw alarms/day for a Tier-1; >65% are
      redundant or low-value, slowing triage and inflating OPEX.
    - >-
      Slow incident response: Baseline MTTA 8–20 minutes and MTTR 60–180 minutes
      for cross-domain faults (RAN/Core/Transport), driving SLA penalties and
      churn risk.
    - >-
      Siloed tooling and data: KPIs, topology, CM/changes, and alarms live in
      separate systems (ENM/NMS, Netcool, ServiceNow, Splunk), preventing fast
      correlation and RCA.
    - >-
      Inconsistent ticket quality: Manual ticket enrichment takes 3–8
      minutes/ticket and is often incomplete, hampering handoffs to field ops
      and Level-3 engineers.
    - >-
      Loss of tribal knowledge: SOPs and heuristics live with senior engineers;
      attrition and outsourcing create knowledge gaps across shifts and vendors.
    - >-
      Vendor heterogeneity and 5G complexity: Multi-vendor RAN (Ericsson, Nokia,
      Huawei), 5GC, vRAN/Open RAN, and MEC increase event volumes and causal
      ambiguity.
    - >-
      Change-induced incidents: Unplanned config changes and maintenance windows
      routinely trigger cascades; current systems rarely reconcile changes with
      anomalies in real time.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit pressure: Carriers need consistent incident
      narratives and evidence for regulators and major enterprise customers,
      which are costly to produce manually.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize multi-source data: alarms (SNMP/syslog/traps),
      KPIs/PM counters, topology/inventory (RAN/Core/Transport), CM/changes,
      maintenance windows, weather/power feeds.
    - >-
      Real-time correlation engine: topology- and time-aware clustering converts
      raw alarms into incidents; suppresses duplicates; links anomalies to
      recent changes and known problems.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned AI reasoning: telecom-specific models generate probable root
      cause hypotheses (e.g., RAN backhaul fiber cut vs. eNodeB software fault)
      with confidence and impacted-scope estimation.
    - >-
      Action recommendations: propose next best actions mapped to carrier
      SOPs/playbooks (e.g., rollback config, disable neighbor relations,
      dispatch fiber vendor) with risk/safety checks.
    - >-
      Automatic ticket enrichment: populate ServiceNow/BMC with root cause
      summary, impacted sites/cells, KPIs-before/after, change refs, and
      suggested actions; attach evidence and timelines.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: analysts accept/modify recommendations;
      feedback continuously retrains correlation and action models; track
      acceptance rate and precision/recall.
    - >-
      Closed-loop automation (optional): execute low-risk remediation via
      orchestrators (ONAP, SMO, NetConf/Ansible) under guardrails and rollback
      policies.
    - >-
      Explainability and audit: show causal graph, evidence, and rationale used
      to form the recommendation; export audit packages for SLAs and regulators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut MTTA by 50–75% and MTTR by 30–50% within 90 days by correlating
    alarms/KPIs/topology into clear incidents, summarizing probable root cause
    with confidence scores, and auto-enriching 80–95% of tickets—deployed
    on-prem or VPC, vendor-agnostic, human-in-the-loop, and audit-ready.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A telecom-specific causal graph and labeled incident/action dataset built
    across multi-vendor networks; a library of prebuilt connectors and
    SOP-aligned playbooks; ability to run fully on-prem/air-gapped with
    explainable AI and audit-ready outputs—co-developed with lighthouse carriers
    and SI partners to shorten time-to-value and procurement cycles.
