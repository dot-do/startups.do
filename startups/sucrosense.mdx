leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned process deviations in diffuser, purification, evaporation,
      crystallization, and centrifuges cause sugar losses (0.2–1.0% of potential
      yield) and energy overruns without early detection.
    - >-
      Existing plant historians and dashboards are descriptive, not predictive;
      engineers spend 2–4 hours/day manually trending tags and miss multivariate
      anomalies.
    - >-
      Root causes are often cross-unit (e.g., diffuser temperature ripple
      impacting crystallization CSD), making single-loop alarms noisy and
      non-actionable (high false-positive rate).
    - >-
      Seasonal campaigns compress improvement windows; lack of fast, quantified
      insights prevents quick tuning and sustained standardization across
      shifts.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal; retirements and turnover degrade process consistency
      and RCA speed.
    - >-
      Cybersecurity and data-integration friction with generic cloud analytics
      slow adoption and time-to-value.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a secure edge connector to plant historian (OSIsoft PI/AVEVA,
      Honeywell PHD, Aspen IP.21) and online analyzers; auto-map tags to a
      beet-process ontology.
    - >-
      Train plant-specific multivariate models (PLS/autoencoders +
      first-principles soft sensors) for diffuser extraction, juice
      purification, evaporation steam economy, crystallization
      supersaturation/CSD, and centrifuge throughput/losses.
    - >-
      Provide real-time anomaly scores with contextual RCA: causal graphs,
      likely drivers, and high-confidence corrective actions (e.g., adjust
      diffuser chip size distribution or temperature ramp rate).
    - >-
      Quantify business impact per event (kg sugar loss avoided, GJ saved,
      chemicals saved) and produce shift/weekly reports for CI meetings.
    - >-
      Close the loop via advisory setpoint ranges and watchlists; integrate with
      CMMS for condition-based maintenance on centrifuges and evaporators.
    - >-
      Deliver secure cloud or on-prem analytics with IEC 62443-aligned
      architecture, SSO, and audit trails; sub-24h model drift monitoring and
      re-tuning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on, beet-specific multivariate monitoring that detects yield- and
    energy-impacting anomalies minutes to hours earlier than DCS alarms,
    quantifies $ impact, and guides operators with root-cause hints tailored to
    diffuser→centrifuge interactions. Implemented in weeks, payback within a
    campaign.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific library of beet sugar soft sensors and causal graphs
    spanning diffuser→crystallization→centrifuges, tuned with multi-plant,
    multi-campaign labeled events. Integration accelerators (PI AF templates)
    cut onboarding to weeks; playbooks quantify expected KPI deltas, turning
    alerts into trusted operator actions.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations leaders at beet sugar plants who must keep diffuser,
    purification, evaporation, crystallization, and centrifuges on target to hit
    throughput, purity, and cost goals.
  problem: >-
    KPIs drift between lab checks; alarms are noisy or late; root causes hide
    across units—driving yield loss, color spikes, fouling shutdowns, and
    overtime firefighting.
  guide: >-
    An always-on AI with beet sugar process know-how; we understand campaign
    pressure and turn plant data into clear anomaly alerts with likely
    root-cause hints you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Secure read-only connection to SCADA/historian. 2) Select critical KPIs
    per area (diffuser, purification, evaporation, crystallization,
    centrifuges). 3) Train and validate anomaly/causal models on your seasons.
    4) Go live with dashboards and smart alerts. 5) Weekly optimization reviews
    and tuning.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on one area (e.g., diffuser) or request a demo and KPI
    gap report.
  success: >-
    See issues hours sooner with likely causes, stabilize pans and crystal CV,
    reduce steam 5–10%, lift yield 0.5–1.5%, cut downtime 20–40%, and ship
    consistent, high-purity sugar.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing after the fact, run off-spec massecuite, waste steam and
    chemicals, suffer unplanned stops, and erode campaign margins.
