  problem:
    - >-
      Conflicts between plans, details, and specs for concrete
      foundations/structures are frequent (e.g., mismatched slab thickness,
      rebar spacing, concrete strength, embed locations) and are often caught
      late, creating RFIs, delays, and costly rework.
    - >-
      RFIs and change-order proposals are drafted manually by estimators/PMs,
      consuming 1–3 hours per item and often lacking the marked-up evidence and
      standardized language that speeds approvals.
    - >-
      Missed or underpriced change orders leave 0.3–1.0% of contract value on
      the table for concrete subs due to poor conflict detection, weak
      documentation, and inconsistent pricing methods.
    - >-
      Version churn (addenda, bulletins) and fragmented systems (PDFs,
      Procore/ACC, Bluebeam) make it hard to track plan/spec revisions and
      maintain a defensible audit trail for RFIs and COs.
    - >-
      Small and mid-sized concrete contractors lack VDC/BIM resources to
      systematically check drawings and specs at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parsing of plan sets, specs, and addenda to detect cross-document
      conflicts (dimensions, rebar schedules vs details, strength classes,
      embeds, tolerances, curing requirements, construction joints).
    - >-
      Automated RFI drafting: pre-filled subject, background, question, proposed
      resolution, clouded markups/hyperlinks to sheets and spec sections, and
      distribution lists aligned to GC workflows.
    - >-
      Change-order proposal generator: scope narrative, quantification
      (materials/labor/equipment), pricing using a regionalized cost
      library/custom rates, and schedule impact language; produces a
      ready-to-send PDF and Procore/ACC package.
    - >-
      Revision differencing: highlights changes between drawing/spec versions;
      updates RFIs/COs and maintains a full audit trail and version history.
    - >-
      Integrations: Procore, Autodesk Build/PlanGrid, Bluebeam Revu, and email;
      one-click publish of RFIs/PCOs into existing workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA options: estimator/PM review in-app with redline
      tools; configurable approval gates before submission.
    - >-
      Metrics dashboard: RFI cycle times, acceptance rates, detected conflicts
      per 100 sheets, approved CO value by project and category.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect plan/spec conflicts early and auto-draft RFIs and change-order
    proposals—with marked-up evidence, line-item pricing, and schedule
    impact—cutting RFI prep time by 70–90% and helping concrete contractors
    capture an additional 0.3–0.8% of contract value in approved changes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset of concrete-specific conflicts mapped to
    successful RFI/CO outcomes and pricing, combined with pre-approved language
    templates from major GCs and deep integrations into Procore/ACC/Bluebeam.
    This feedback loop improves precision and acceptance rates faster than
    generalist AI or manual workflows.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Poured-concrete foundation and structure contractors—PMs, estimators, and
    supers—who want to pour on schedule, protect margin, and avoid rework.
  problem: >-
    External: Plan/spec conflicts, missing details, and sequencing clashes
    trigger RFIs and COs, but finding and documenting them is slow and
    error-prone.

    Internal: You’re buried in paperwork, worried your pricing won’t stick, and
    tired of after-hours drafting.

    Philosophical: If the scope changes or drawings conflict, you should be
    paid—clean documentation shouldn’t be a barrier to fair compensation.
  guide: >-
    We understand the concrete grind—tight windows, unforgiving pours, and zero
    room for ambiguity. Our AI, built with input from concrete PMs and
    estimators and trained to spot plan/spec inconsistencies, drafts clear RFIs
    and change-order proposals with marked-up evidence and itemized pricing.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Upload plans, specs, and addenda.

    2) AI flags conflicts and drafts RFIs/COs with markups, scope notes, and
    pricing.

    3) You review, edit, and export to PDF/email or your workflow.

    Agreement Plan:

    - You approve every submission.

    - Data remains private and project-bound.

    - Start with a low-risk pilot; cancel anytime.

    Transitional: Get the Concrete RFI/CO Starter Kit—sample output, checklist,
    and pricing worksheet.
  success: >-
    Catch conflicts before mobilization. Speed up RFI responses. Increase CO
    approval rate and pricing accuracy. Maintain a defensible audit trail with
    markups. Protect margin and keep the schedule intact.
  failure: >-
    Missed conflicts, unpaid scope creep, denied COs, rework, schedule slips,
    and margin erosion leading to disputes.

    - >-
      Conflicting structural plans, specs, and addenda slip through—causing
