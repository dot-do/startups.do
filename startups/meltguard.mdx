  problem:
    - >-
      Yield loss: Visible contaminants (paint, plastics, rubber, salts,
      moisture) increase dross and flux consumption, reducing metallic yield by
      0.5–2.0 percentage points. For a 100,000 t/yr plant, every 1 pp yield loss
      ≈ $200k–$300k/year at $2,000–$3,000/ton alloy value.
    - >-
      Safety incidents: Moisture and sealed containers can cause steam
      explosions and furnace pops. Mid-sized plants report 1–3 charge-related
      incidents/year, each costing $50k–$500k in downtime, damage, and EHS
      response.
    - >-
      Manual grading variability: Visual checks at the gate/tipper are
      inconsistent across shifts and weather; inspection coverage is often <50%
      of loads during peak periods and nights. Error/oversight rates of 15–30%
      are common without photographic evidence.
    - >-
      Supplier disputes: Lack of auditable evidence leads to slow claims
      resolution and write-offs. Disputes can tie up $50k–$250k in working
      capital per incident and strain supplier relationships.
    - >-
      Bottlenecks: Waiting for lab results or manual checks delays unloading and
      furnace charging, reducing throughput by 2–10% in busy yards.
    - >-
      Compliance gaps: ISO 9001/IATF 16949 and customer audits increasingly
      require traceability and documented incoming quality controls, which are
      hard to maintain with manual processes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-deployed computer vision models on gate/tipper/cab cameras to detect
      and quantify contamination (% area, type) and identify sealed containers
      before charging.
    - >-
      Risk scoring with configurable thresholds by alloy/charge recipe (e.g.,
      moisture tolerance, paint limits for specific cast alloys).
    - >-
      Actionable workflows: auto alerts to scale house/yard radios; recommended
      actions (segregate, dry, reject, re-grade); supplier claim package
      generation with annotated images.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: <2-minute SLA verification for exceptions,
      training feedback loop, and dispute-ready documentation.
    - >-
      Multi-input support: fixed cameras, mobile app for handheld photos/video,
      crane-mounted views; offline-capable edge inference with cloud sync.
    - >-
      Integrations: scale/weighbridge (e.g., METTLER TOLEDO), yard management
      (AMCS, ReMatter), ERP/QMS (SAP, Oracle), and EHS incident logs.
    - >-
      Analytics: supplier quality scorecards, contamination trend dashboards,
      melt loss correlation, and ROI reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, AI-assisted visual grading that flags moisture, sealed
    containers, plastics, paint, salts, and off-grade items in under 90 seconds
    with optional human verification—reducing dross by 0.5–1.5 pp, cutting
    charge-related incidents by 50%+, and providing auditable photo/video
    evidence and supplier scorecards to recover costs and prevent recurrence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset linking specific contamination signatures to actual melt
    loss and incident outcomes across multiple smelters, refined through
    human-in-the-loop verification and site-specific tuning—combined with
