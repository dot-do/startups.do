leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inaccurate batch ETAs (often ±60–180 minutes) trigger tank constraint
      breaches, suboptimal linefill management, and marine demurrage
      ($20k–$100k/day per vessel).
    - >-
      Interface volume estimates are routinely off by 10–40%, causing
      unnecessary transmix cuts and off-spec contamination events costing
      $50k–$500k per incident.
    - >-
      Schedulers lack real-time, uncertainty-aware predictions and rely on
      static hydraulic models and spreadsheets; models are rarely recalibrated
      to current viscosity, temperature, DRA, and pump configurations.
    - >-
      Quality risk (comingled crude specs like TAN, sulfur, RVP, BS&W) is not
      quantified ahead of time; tank flips and cut plans are reactive rather
      than prescriptive.
    - >-
      OT/IT data fragmentation (SCADA, historian, lab assays, batch tickets,
      pump status) makes building a unified, auditable prediction workflow
      difficult.
    - >-
      Regulatory and audit requirements (e.g., PHMSA Part 195, API standards)
      necessitate traceability and explainability that current in-house tools
      lack.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline integrating SCADA/historian (e.g., PI), batch
      tickets, lab assays, topology, pump status, ambient data, and DRA
      injection rates.
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML models calibrated per line/segment that output ETA
      distributions (P10/P50/P90), interface volume forecasts (bbl +
      uncertainty), and contamination likelihoods by grade pair.
    - >-
      Prescriptive engine to generate optimal cut plans and tank schedules
      subject to operational constraints (tank ullage, custody transfer windows,
      pump curves, blend specs).
    - >-
      Real-time alerting for early/late arrivals, interface growth, and quality
      risk, with root-cause drivers (temperature shift, pump configuration,
      viscosity change).
    - >-
      What-if simulators for schedulers (e.g., different batch orders, DRA
      dosage, pump lineups, flow targets) to minimize interface and demurrage.
    - >-
      APIs and adapters to push predictions into scheduling/TMS, terminal
      management, and marine ETA systems; audit-ready reports for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Physics-informed, uncertainty-quantified AI that predicts batch ETAs,
    interface volumes, and contamination risk in real time—and automatically
    translates predictions into optimal cut plans and tank schedules. Reduce
    transmix by 10–25%, cut ETA error by 60–80% (to <15–30 minutes on 200–500 mi
    lines), halve off-spec incidents, and deliver 5–10x ROI within 6–12
    months—deployable on-prem for OT security.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Line-calibrated, physics-informed ML with uncertainty quantification and
    prescriptive cut planning, packaged for OT environments with proven
    connectors, auditability, and on-prem deployment—plus cross-operator
    learning (where permissible) that improves interface modeling beyond what
    single-operator in-house tools can achieve.
