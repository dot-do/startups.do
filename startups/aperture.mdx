  problem:
    - >-
      Claims intake from email/web/phone is slow and manual, leading to average
      FNOL handle times of 15–30 minutes per claim and long queues during
      catastrophes.
    - >-
      Coverage validation at FNOL is inconsistent; adjusters often lack
      immediate access to policy endorsements/exclusions, causing rework,
      leakage, and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Carriers lack standardized, explainable severity/complexity triage at
      FNOL, resulting in suboptimal routing, higher loss adjustment expenses
      (LAE), and longer cycle times.
    - >-
      Existing tools are siloed (OCR, IVR, chat, core systems) and require heavy
      IT lift to integrate; upgrades stall due to long implementation timelines
      and compliance concerns.
    - >-
      Data quality of unstructured communications (emails, transcripts) is poor;
      PII redaction and audit trails are insufficient for regulatory scrutiny
      (e.g., NYDFS 500, GDPR/CCPA).
  solution:
    - >-
      Multichannel intake automation: ingest and normalize FNOL from email, web
      forms, SMS, and call transcripts via API, SFTP, and event streams.
    - >-
      Real-time coverage validation: policy lookup against core/PA systems to
      confirm in-force/limits/deductibles/endts; flag likely uncovered perils;
      produce an explainable coverage rationale.
    - >-
      AI triage scoring: severity (loss magnitude) and complexity (investigation
      effort) scores with configurable thresholds, feeding assignment/routing
      rules.
    - >-
      Next-best-action routing: auto-assign simple claims to straight-through or
      express lanes; route complex claims to senior adjusters/special units;
      trigger early vendor engagement (tow, mitigation).
    - >-
      Compliance-grade auditability: full decision logs, PII redaction,
      versioned models, and human-in-the-loop overrides to support internal
      audits and regulators.
    - >-
      Rapid integration: prebuilt adapters for Guidewire ClaimCenter, Duck Creek
      Claims, Sapiens, Origami, Salesforce, and contact centers (Genesys, Five9,
      Amazon Connect, NICE).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce FNOL intake time by 70–85% and achieve 50–70% straight-through triage
    with explainable coverage checks—integrated to your core claims in weeks,
    with auditable AI decisions that meet insurer compliance standards.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    across multiple carriers, combined with prebuilt core-system adapters and
    compliance-grade explainability that meets insurer audit standards—hard for
    generalist AI vendors to replicate.

    Claims and operations leaders at P&C and specialty carriers (Other Direct
    Insurance) who need consistent, 24/7 FNOL and reliable triage across email,
    web, and phone.
  problem: >-
    External: FNOL arrives via fragmented channels and requires manual data
    entry, coverage checks, and routing. Internal: teams are overloaded, cycle
    times slip, and triage is inconsistent. Philosophical: policyholders deserve
    a fast, accurate first touch without repeating themselves.

    Empathy: We understand the pressure to cut cycle time, leakage, and LAE
    while staying compliant. Authority: Insurance-grade AI built by claims
    experts, explainable outputs, SOC 2 compliant, proven at carriers, supported
    by domain specialists.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect inboxes, web forms, call transcripts, and policy/claims systems
    via API. 2) AI extracts key data, validates coverage, scores severity and
    complexity, and flags anomalies. 3) Route to the right queue or
    straight-through with clear explanations and SLA triggers.

    FNOL ROI calculator and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Instant intake across channels; clean structured claim data; accurate
    coverage validation; smart routing; shorter cycle times; lower LAE; higher
    NPS; adjusters focused on high-value work; audit-ready traceability.
  failure: >-
    Without this: intake backlogs, slow first response, missed coverage issues,
    misrouted claims, leakage, compliance findings, and churned policyholders.
