  problem:
    - >-
      Quality drift on critical-to-quality (CTQ) ammo measurements (powder
      charge weight, overall length/OAL, primer seating depth, case wall
      thickness, bullet runout, case hardness) is detected late using manual
      sampling and basic Shewhart charts, causing scrap, rework, and occasional
      line stops.
    - >-
      Siloed data across gauges, PLCs, vision systems, checkweighers, CMMs, and
      ballistic test benches makes real-time SPC and traceability difficult;
      many plants still rely on spreadsheets or manual entry into generic SPC
      tools.
    - >-
      Existing SPC implementations lack robust drift/change-point detection
      (e.g., EWMA/CUSUM/Bayesian) and prescriptive actions; alarms are noisy
      (false positives) or miss slow tool-wear drifts.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance burden (DoD lot acceptance, ISO 9001, SAAMI/CIP
      conformance, MIL-STD-1916 sampling documentation) consumes 40–120 hours
      per audit and is error-prone when records are manual.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and overcorrection: engineers overreact to single-point
      outliers; poor guidance leads to unnecessary adjustments, increasing
      variability.
    - >-
      Skill and capacity gap: many quality teams lack advanced data science
      capability to deploy, tune, and maintain real-time SPC at the edge,
      particularly in air-gapped/regulated environments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from production assets: PLCs (Rockwell/Siemens),
      checkweighers (Mettler Toledo), vision systems (Keyence/Cognex),
      micrometers/CMMs, hardness testers, and ballistic benches.
    - >-
      Ammo-focused SPC engine: Shewhart, EWMA, CUSUM, and Bayesian change-point
      detection tuned for common ammo CTQs and cycle times; automatic sampling
      frequency optimization based on risk and throughput.
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance and closed-loop control: recommends tool offsets,
      die change/maintenance windows, and sampling plan adjustments; optional
      PLC write-backs under guardrails for micro-corrections.
    - >-
      Real-time alerting and escalation: SMS/Teams/Andon with role-based
      routing; prioritization by risk-to-spec and lot impact; hold/stop
      recommendations with estimated cost-of-delay vs. cost-of-scrap.
    - >-
      Digital lot traveler and audit pack: auto-built SAAMI/MIL-STD lot dossiers
      with control charts, capability indices, calibration traceability, and
      e-signatures; one-click export for auditors/customers.
    - >-
      Edge-first deployment options: on-prem appliance for
      low-latency/air-gapped plants with secure sync to cloud (GovCloud-ready)
      for multi-site analytics.
    - >-
      Root-cause analytics: correlates drifts with setup/maintenance logs, tool
      wear, operator shifts, and raw material lots; suggests probable causes
      with confidence scores.
    - >-
      KPI and economics dashboard: scrap/rework by CTQ, detection lead-time,
      Cpk/Ppk trends, downtime avoided, and dollarized savings; tracks pilot ROI
      vs. baseline.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Ammo-specific, real-time SPC and drift-detection copilot that connects to
    your gauges, PLCs, and test benches, detects process shifts 20–60 minutes
    earlier than standard charts, cuts CTQ-related scrap 20–40%, improves Cpk by
    0.2–0.5, and auto-generates SAAMI/MIL-compliant lot records—without adding
    headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammunition-specific SPC/drift models and CTQ templates validated with
    lighthouse plants, plus a curated dataset of labeled ammo process drifts
    that generic SPC vendors lack. Pre-built connectors and closed-loop control
    patterns for common ammo lines, and audit-ready SAAMI/MIL documentation out
    of the box. Edge-first, air-gapped-capable architecture aligned with defense
    requirements.

  character: >-
    Operations, Quality, and Process Engineering leaders at small arms
    ammunition manufacturers (NAICS 332992) who must keep CTQ measurements in
    control, hit yield targets, and pass audits without surprises.
  problem: >-
    A silent villain: process drift. External: manual SPC in spreadsheets,
    delayed feedback from gauges and test stands, and blind spots across shifts
    and lines causing scrap and rework. Internal: stress from firefighting,
    audit anxiety, and eroding margins. Philosophical: it shouldn’t take a
    recall or late-stage scrap to discover drift.
  guide: >-
    SPC & Drift Detection Copilot understands the pressure to maintain tight
    CTQs at scale. Built by manufacturing data scientists and quality engineers,
    it applies proven SPC best practices with secure deployment (on‑prem or
    VPC), integrates with gauges, CMMs, MES/LIMS/ERP, and provides audit-ready
    traceability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Stream CTQ data from gauges, CMMs, test stands, and MES/LIMS;
    choose secure deployment. 2) Configure: Define CTQs, specs/targets, sampling
    plans, control charts, and drift rules; baseline models. 3) Control: Monitor
    in real time, receive intelligent alerts, investigate deviations, and
    auto-generate CAPA and audit reports.

    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot with defined success
    criteria. Transitional: Download the SPC readiness checklist and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Early drift detection, lower scrap and rework, stable processes across
    shifts, faster investigations, clean audits with traceable control evidence,
    and confident, on‑target production that protects margins and delivery
    commitments.
  failure: >-
    Without action: undetected drift, costly scrap and rework, missed shipments,
    audit findings, margin erosion, and increased risk of product holds or
    recalls.
