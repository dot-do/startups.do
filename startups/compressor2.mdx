  problem:
    - >-
      Pipeline compressor stations waste 2–8% fuel due to conservative
      anti-surge margins, suboptimal unit selection, and manual setpoint tuning.
    - >-
      Operators lack a real-time, constraint-aware optimizer that balances
      throughput, fuel, and emissions while respecting OEM maps, anti-surge
      control, and safety limits.
    - >-
      Mixed fleets (reciprocating and centrifugal, different OEMs) and changing
      ambient/line conditions make consistent optimal operation difficult across
      shifts and seasons.
    - >-
      SCADA/DCS alarms and anti-surge events increase risk and cause unplanned
      recycle, consuming extra fuel and reducing equipment life.
    - >-
      Regulatory and ESG pressure to cut CO2 and methane intensity require
      measurable reductions without compromising reliability or throughput.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a hybrid physics+ML optimizer that uses compressor maps, station
      constraints, and live SCADA data to compute advisory setpoints: unit
      selection, load split, speed/load, IGV/pocketing, recycle positions,
      target anti-surge margin.
    - >-
      Edge application connected to SCADA/DCS (read-only initially) with
      operator HMI to present recommendations, constraint rationales, and
      predicted benefits (fuel, CO2, throughput).
    - >-
      Automated model calibration from historian data (e.g., PI), including
      ambient corrections and dirty/clean performance states; periodic
      re-identification.
    - >-
      Anti-surge-aware optimizer enforces minimum margin envelopes (e.g.,
      dynamic 10–15% based on stability) and hard constraints (pressures,
      temperatures, power, vibration).
    - >-
      Optional closed-loop mode after pilot: setpoint write-back with
      interlocks, MOC process, and OEM-approved limits.
    - >-
      Fleet view: roll-up KPIs, benchmarking, exception-based alerts, and
      dispatch recommendations across multiple stations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, safety-aware setpoint advisory that reduces fuel 2–6%, cuts CO2
    intensity, and increases throughput 1–3% by optimizing unit dispatch, load

    SCADA/DCS, and proves savings with auditable M&V.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    and dynamic margin control, proven across mixed fleets; audited M&V library
    and benchmarks enabling performance-based contracts; established

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline operations leaders and control room engineers for natural-gas
    transmission who must hit nominations, minimize fuel and emissions, and
    protect equipment/compliance.
  problem: >-
    Static, conservative setpoints and manual tuning can’t keep up with changing
    ambient, gas composition, and network conditions—causing excess fuel burn
    and CO2, surge risk and alarm storms, constrained throughput, and compliance
    headaches.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to move gas safely and efficiently; our
    OEM-agnostic AI combines compressor maps, surge-control expertise, and
    pipeline hydraulics, integrates securely with SCADA/DCS, and is validated by
    domain SMEs and field pilots.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & baseline: non-intrusive data integration and performance
    benchmarking. 2) Calibrate & optimize: digital twin + real-time optimizer
    with anti-surge and constraint guardrails. 3) Advise & scale:
    operator-facing setpoints with explainability, KPI tracking, and rollout
    from one pilot station to fleet.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a demo and start a 90-day pilot at one station; request a
    customized ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Operators trust clear, explainable advisory setpoints; measurable fuel
    savings and emissions reductions (often 3–10%); throughput met or increased
    within limits; zero surge events; fewer alarms; audit-ready compliance
    reports; months-level payback.
  failure: >-
    Keep overburning fuel and paying for avoidable CO2/NOx, risk surge and
    unplanned downtime, miss nominations, raise OPEX and compliance exposure,
    and leave capacity and margin on the table.
