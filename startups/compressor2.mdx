leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Alarm floods and high false-positive rates in SCADA/historian systems
      overwhelm control rooms, delaying true issue detection.
    - >-
      Unplanned compressor outages (surge, seal failure, valve wear, lube-oil
      issues) are detected late, increasing MTTR and throughput losses.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis depends on scarce rotating-equipment experts;
      knowledge is fragmented across OEMs and shifts.
    - >-
      Tickets/work orders lack precise context (time window, tags, operating
      regime), slowing field response and parts readiness.
    - >-
      Threshold/rule-based alarms do not adapt to seasonal load, ambient
      conditions, or unit-specific behavior.
    - >-
      Multi-OEM fleets (centrifugal/recip; Solar, Siemens, GE/BH, Ariel) create
      inconsistent diagnostics across sites.
    - >-
      Regulatory incident reporting (PHMSA) requires structured evidence and
      audit trails that are manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Cyber and data-transfer constraints (air-gapped, one-way diodes) hinder
      advanced analytics deployment.
    - >-
      Inconsistent triage prioritization leads to suboptimal dispatch and
      unnecessary shutdowns.
    - >-
      Retirements and turnover risk loss of institutional know-how for fault
      signatures and corrective actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-intrusive data integration with historians (e.g., OSIsoft PI/AVEVA,
      Aspen IP.21, Honeywell PHD) via read-only connectors/OPC UA; optional edge
      agent for air-gapped sites.
    - >-
      Unit-specific baseline modeling that adapts to ambient conditions and
      operating regimes (load, speed, suction/discharge pressure, temperature,
      vibration, lube-oil variables).
    - >-
      Real-time anomaly scoring with severity and risk-of-impact (throughput
      loss, emissions, equipment damage) using hybrid ML + physics-informed
      features.
    - >-
      Triage reasoning using a compressor fault library (surge, fouling, valve
      wear, seal leak, pulsation issues, bearing degradation, lube-oil faults)
      with confidence ranking and differentiating look-alikes.
    - >-
      Action generator producing operator-verified steps (e.g., reduce load
      5–10%, inspect lube filters, verify anti-surge controller) and parts
      suggestions with estimated time-to-failure/urgency.
    - >-
      Auto-ticket creation in EAM/CMMS (ServiceNow, Maximo, SAP PM) with time
      windows, tag snapshots, plots, and suggested work type/priority, plus
      linkage to SOPs and MOC where relevant.
    - >-
      Alarm hygiene: suppression/de-duplication and dynamic thresholds compliant
      with API RP 1167; reduces alarm floods without hiding safety-critical
      alerts.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop feedback to accept/override diagnoses; system learns
      from operator input and post-mortems to improve precision/recall.
    - >-
      Security-by-design deployment options: on-prem/edge, private VPC, or
      hybrid; support for one-way data diodes and zero-trust access; full audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Outcomes dashboard quantifying avoided downtime hours, MTTR reduction,
      false alarm reduction, and emissions avoidance for ROI tracking and
      compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI triage that continuously detects, ranks, and explains compressor
    anomalies, recommends likely causes and actions, and auto-opens context-rich
    tickets—cutting nuisance alarms 40–60%, reducing MTTR 20–30%, and preventing
    costly unplanned downtime while supporting API/PHMSA-aligned auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, operator-verified compressor fault library spanning multi-OEM
    fleets; production-proven connectors to major historians/EAMs; and
    human-in-the-loop learning tied to API/PHMSA-aligned audit trails—creating a

    Compressor Station Anomaly Triage Agent: an AI service that continuously
    detects and ranks abnormal compressor behavior, explains likely causes and
    actions, and opens context-rich tickets in your CMMS. Integrates with your
    historian/SCADA and keeps operators in control with clear confidence and
    rationale.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historian/SCADA and CMMS; define assets and operating envelopes.
    2) Pilot to baseline, tune thresholds, and validate triage and ticket flows.
    3) Go live with 24/7 ranked anomalies, cause hypotheses, recommended next
    steps, auto-opened tickets, and weekly review summaries.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 60-day pilot at two stations.
  success: >-
    Teams focus on the right issues, MTTR drops, nuisance alarms decline, fewer
    surprise outages and emission events, improved throughput and asset health,
    and audit-ready context.
  failure: >-
    Do nothing and hidden degradation persists, alarms drown signal, outages and
    callouts increase, OPEX climbs, and compliance exposure grows.
