  risks:
    - Standards interpretation requires SME validation
    - Incomplete or outdated internal docs

  problem:
    - >-
      Mapping internal SOPs and controls to multiple evolving standards (ISO
      9001/14001/17025/45001, ISO 13485, NIST 800-171/CMMC, SOC 2, FDA QSR,
      OSHA/EPA rules) is manual, slow (2–8 weeks), and inconsistent across
      consultants.
    - >-
      Consultancies duplicate effort on crosswalks and templates for each client
      and standard; knowledge isn’t reusable at scale, leading to 20–40% margin
      erosion on fixed-fee gap assessments.
    - >-
      Clients struggle to prioritize remediation; findings aren’t risk-weighted
      or tied to evidence, causing rework and missed audit findings.
    - >-
      Standards and guidance change frequently; staying current requires
      constant SME time and creates delivery risk.
    - >-
      Audit readiness packages are fragmented across
      SharePoint/Confluence/Box/email; assembling auditor-friendly evidence
      packs adds 30–60 hours per engagement.
    - >-
      Demand for rapid pre-assessment (RFPs, due diligence) exceeds team
      capacity; boutique firms lose revenue due to bandwidth constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      NLP-powered control mapping: Ingest SOPs/process docs and map to
      applicable clauses/controls across selected standards with confidence
      scores and rationales.
    - >-
      Standards crosswalk library: Prebuilt, curated mappings between common
      frameworks (e.g., ISO 9001↔ISO 13485↔FDA QSR; NIST 800-171↔CMMC↔SOC 2).
    - >-
      Prioritized remediation planning: Auto-generate gap list with risk/impact
      and effort estimates, dependencies, and recommended tasks/owners.
    - >-
      Evidence harvesting: Auto-link controls to existing artifacts (records,
      logs, training), flagging missing evidence and suggested templates.
    - >-
      Change intelligence: Track standard revisions and notify which mapped
      controls/SOPs are impacted; propose updates.
    - >-
      Auditor-ready export: One-click generation of objective evidence packs and
      clause-by-clause justifications with traceability.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: SME workflows to approve mappings, adjust
      weights, and lock accepted crosswalks for reuse.
    - >-
      Integrations: Connect to SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, Box, Jira,
      ServiceNow, popular QMS/LIMS/ELN tools via API.
    - >-
      Benchmarking: Anonymized metrics comparing client control maturity vs
      peers in the same industry/size.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, non-legal compliance mapping that turns your existing SOPs and
    artifacts into a prioritized, evidence-backed remediation plan in hours, not
    weeks—boosting consultant throughput 2–3x and improving audit pass rates
    while maintaining human oversight.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, human-verified cross-standard ontology built from
    thousands of real-world engagements and change events, delivered through
    auditor-accepted exports and partnerships with accreditation bodies—creating
    a data and distribution moat that generic GRC tools lack.

  character: >-
    Leaders in scientific and technical consulting firms who must prove
    compliance to standards and client requirements without expanding headcount.
  problem: >-
    Standards and regulations are fragmented and change fast; manual mapping of
    internal procedures is slow, inconsistent, and easy to miss—one gap can
    trigger audit findings, rework, and lost contracts. You shouldn’t have to
    guess what “good” looks like.
  guide: >-
    We understand compliance fatigue. We pair domain expertise with AI to map
    your procedures to the exact clauses of applicable standards—providing
    clear, non-legal guidance with transparent traceability to cited
    requirements.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect policies, SOPs, and controls; choose target frameworks (e.g., ISO
    9001, ISO/IEC 27001, GLP/GxP, NIST, client SOWs). 2) AI maps content to
    requirements, flags gaps, and risk-scores findings. 3) Receive a prioritized
    remediation plan with owners, effort, and templates; implement and re-scan
    for continuous readiness. Non-legal; consult counsel for legal
    interpretation.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot with your real documents today—or download a sample gap report
    to see the outputs.
  success: >-
    Be audit-ready with a defensible, clause-linked evidence map; a clear,
    prioritized remediation backlog; faster RFP responses; lower compliance
    risk; and a team aligned on what to fix first.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: missed requirements, audit findings, costly rework,
    project delays, and lost bids due to unclear compliance narratives.
