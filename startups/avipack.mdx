  problem:
    - >-
      Manual collation of COA/COO/HACCP/FSIS documents per shipment consumes
      10–30 minutes each, creating overtime costs and shipment delays.
    - >-
      Customer-specific requirements (e.g., different retailers/foodservice
      distributors) vary by SKU/lot and change frequently; teams struggle to
      keep rules current, causing ASN rejections or chargebacks.
    - >-
      Lots often split across multiple pallets/shipments and combine across
      suppliers; matching documents to the correct lot/shipment is error-prone
      without system support.
    - >-
      Missing or late documents (e.g., COA not received from supplier lab) stall
      shipments or trigger receiving holds, rework, and detention fees.
    - >-
      Document sources are fragmented (email, supplier portals, lab PDFs, ERP
      attachments, shared drives), making version control and audit trails
      difficult during FSIS or customer audits.
    - >-
      After-hours and weekend shipments lack coverage from key staff who “know
      the process,” increasing risk of late or incomplete documentation packs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent ASN attachments/pack formats create friction with EDI
      partners and receivers; small errors create outsized penalties.
    - >-
      Lack of visibility to compliance status by shipment (ready/not ready,
      missing docs, exceptions) impairs operations and customer service (ETAs
      communicated without doc readiness).
    - >-
      Retention and traceability obligations (multi-year) are not centralized;
      responding to audit requests is time-consuming (hours/days).
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion: Capture documents via email intake, supplier/lab SFTP,
      EDI attachments, API, and drag/drop portal; auto-associate to supplier,
      product, and date range.
    - >-
      AI extraction/classification: OCR + models tuned for poultry docs (COA
      micro results, plant numbers, production dates, weights, HACCP plan refs,
      COO, BOL, temperature logs).
    - >-
      Lot-to-shipment matching: Resolve mixed lots, re-boxing, and partial
      pallets; link COAs to exact lots/line items using ERP/WMS data (SKU, lot,
      prod date, spec).
    - >-
      Customer rule engine: Maintain receiver-specific checklists (which docs,
      acceptable test ranges, plant approvals, label specs); flag exceptions
      early and suggest remediation.
    - >-
      Pack assembly: Generate standardized, receiver-approved pack PDFs or file
      sets; attach to EDI 856 ASN or send via templated email; watermark/redact
      as needed.
    - >-
      Exception workflows: Alert suppliers for missing/invalid docs; track SLA
      to ensure pack-readiness before truck departure; collaborative notes and
      approvals.
    - >-
      Compliance/audit: Immutable audit log, retention policies, full-text
      search, evidence export by shipment/lot/date range; role-based access.
    - >-
      Dashboards and alerts: Live “doc readiness” board by load/ASN; KPIs on
      auto-match rate, exception types, ASN acceptance, aging.
    - >-
      Security and controls: SOC 2-aligned controls, encryption at rest/in
      transit, PII/PHI redaction, SSO/MFA, granular permissions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Zero-touch compliance packs for every poultry shipment. AviPack ingests
    supplier/lab/customer documents, auto-matches them to lots and shipments,
    validates against receiver-specific rules, and delivers complete packs via
    ASN or email—cutting admin time by 80%+, reducing chargebacks by up to 70%,
    and delivering audit-ready traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized rules and template library for poultry receivers, combined
    with models trained on high-volume poultry document corpora and a growing
    network of pre-enabled suppliers/labs. The more customers onboard, the
    richer the receiver rule mappings and supplier validation feedback—improving
    auto-match accuracy and reducing time-to-value in ways horizontal DMS/OCR or
    generic EDI tools cannot easily replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      42444), especially mid-market firms handling 50–2,000 shipments/week with
      mixed products (fresh, frozen, further-processed).
    - >-
      Sub-segments: Export/import-focused poultry wholesalers requiring COO and

  character: >-
    Compliance, operations, and sales-ops leaders at poultry and poultry product
    merchant wholesalers who must keep shipments moving while proving every lot
    meets buyer and regulatory requirements.
  problem: >-
    - External: Buyer and regulator-required docs (COA, COO, HACCP, FSIS, specs)
    are scattered and must be matched to lots and shipments; ASNs or emails need
    the right pack every time.

    - Internal: Manual chasing, copying, and checking cause delays, errors, and
    late-night scrambles.

    - Philosophical: Doing the right thing for food safety shouldn’t cost time,
    revenue, or customer trust.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pre-cutoff scramble—chasing suppliers, combing
    inboxes, and rebuilding the same packs under pressure.

    - Authority: Purpose-built for protein supply chains with COA/COO/HACCP/FSIS
    checklists, robust traceability, and integrations to ERP/EDI/email/SFTP;
    proven implementation playbooks and change management support.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect your sources (supplier email/SFTP/portal, ERP) and
    destinations (ASN/EDI, email). 2) Configure customer- and product-specific
    doc rules, expirations, and validations. 3) Automate: AI assembles lot- and
    shipment-level packs and delivers with ASNs or email; exceptions route to
    your team.

    - Agreement: Secure handling and audit trails, clear roles/permissions,
    human-in-the-loop on low-confidence matches, start with a low-risk pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 20-minute demo; Start a pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the Poultry Compliance Pack Checklist; See a sample
    ASN-ready document pack.
  success: >-
    - Complete, correct packs delivered with every ASN or email.

    - Faster order processing with fewer chargebacks, holds, and rework.

    - Audit-ready traceability and a single system of record for compliance
    docs.

    - Teams focus on customers instead of paperwork; on-time shipments and
    stronger account trust.
  failure: >-
    - Missing or mismatched docs trigger shipment holds, rejections, and
    penalties.

    - Constant firefighting, after-hours prep, and costly manual processes.

    - Audit exposure and damaged relationships with key customers.
