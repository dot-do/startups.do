      stabilized entrance)
    - Size devices using look-up rules; compute lengths/areas
    - Create plan notes and general notes per jurisdiction

  risks:
    - Jurisdictional nuances may require edits or PE stamp
    - Topo accuracy drives BMP placement
    - Hydrologic assumptions may vary
  dependencies:
    - Local BMP standards
    - Survey/topo and site limits
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Bid prep for erosion & sediment control (E&SC) is slow and manual (6–12
      hours per site) using PDFs, Bluebeam/Civil 3D, and spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Quantity takeoffs are error‑prone; over/under‑bidding leads to margin loss
      or lost awards (±15–30% variance common on silt fence/wattles).
    - >-
      Jurisdictional standards vary widely (state/county/municipal/MS4);
      contractors lose time interpreting details and responding to permit
      reviewer comments.
    - >-
      Short bid cycles (24–72 hours) force contractors to use rough assumptions
      instead of site‑specific drainage analysis and sequencing.
    - >-
      Permit resubmittals delay mobilization; rework and fines from
      non‑compliance increase risk exposure.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized sequencing and phasing drives inefficiencies on site
      and change orders with GCs.
    - >-
      Smaller contractors can’t afford in‑house civil/PE support across
      jurisdictions; outsourcing is costly and slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload plan set (PDF/DWG) and select project jurisdiction; AI parses
      grading, contours, drainage patterns, and disturbed limits.
    - >-
      Auto‑layout of BMPs per local standard details (silt fence, wattles, inlet
      protection, check dams, construction entrance, sediment basins/traps,
      blankets, hydroseeding, curb logs).
    - >-
      Hydrology assistant: drainage area delineation, slope/runoff estimation,
      and design storm selection aligned with local codes (e.g., NOAA Atlas 14).
    - >-
      Quantity takeoff and cost estimate with editable pricebook; exports to
      CSV/XLSX and estimating tools.
    - >-
      Phased sequencing and narrative (pre‑construction, perimeter controls,
      active grading, stabilization, final).
    - >-
      Compliance engine: cites code/standard drawing numbers for each BMP; flags
      conflicts (utilities, easements, slopes, driveways).
    - >-
      Deliverables: plan sheets (PDF), CAD/DWG layers for Civil 3D, SWPPP/E&SC
      narrative draft, and installation checklist.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction rules library with automatic updates; side‑by‑side diff when
      standards change.
    - >-
      Approval workflow: optional PE partner review/stamp add‑on; e‑permitting
      package export.
    - >-
      Integrations: Autodesk Civil 3D plugin, Bluebeam, Procore/Docs,
      PlanSwift/STACK for estimates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate permit‑ready E&SC layouts, accurate BMP quantities, and phased
    sequencing in minutes—tailored to local standards—so contractors can bid
    faster, reduce rework, and pass reviews the first time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A living jurisdictional standards graph (hundreds of counties), trained on
    accepted plan submittals and reviewer feedback, combined with CAD‑grade
    exports and a PE partner network—creating a data and distribution moat
    competitors can’t easily replicate.
