  problem:
    - >-
      Quarries face frequent fugitive dust (PM10/PM2.5/TSP) and noise
      complaints/exceedances, but existing monitoring is periodic, manual, and
      reactive.
    - >-
      Attribution is hard: operators can’t reliably prove whether an exceedance
      or complaint originated on-site vs. off-site sources (traffic,
      construction, wildfire smoke).
    - >-
      Regulatory reporting (MSHA/EPA/state/local) is time-consuming (often
      >10–20 hours/month/site) and inconsistent across jurisdictions.
    - >-
      Inspections and NPDES/air permit conditions increasingly require
      defensible data, QA/QC, and chain-of-custody; low-cost sensors alone
      aren’t regulator-ready.
    - >-
      Fines, stop-work orders, and community opposition threaten permits and
      expansion; operators lack real-time, actionable guidance tied to wind and
      production activities.
    - >-
      Traditional consultants provide periodic studies but not continuous,
      operationalized control feedback or automated alerts.
    - >-
      Noise mitigation is reactive; few sites have 24/7 noise plus directional
      wind-informed root cause analysis to optimize blasting windows/haul
      routes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy calibrated perimeter sensors for PM10/PM2.5/TSP and Class
      1/2-equivalent noise monitors plus on-site wind (speed/direction).
    - >-
      AI engine performs real-time exceedance detection,
      inverse-dispersion/source attribution (wind-sector and trajectory
      modeling), and root-cause tagging (blast logs, haul cycles, crusher
      run-time).
    - >-
      Mobile/SCADA-integrated alerts with actionable recommendations (e.g.,
      activate misting on south fence line; delay blasting 30 minutes until wind
      shifts).
    - >-
      Automated, regulator-specific reporting snapshots
      (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly) with QA/QC, calibration checks, and
      chain-of-custody metadata.
    - >-
      Complaint correlation: match community complaints with site data, wind,
      and activity to confirm/refute attribution and craft responses.
    - >-
      Analytics to optimize operations: best blasting windows by
      season/time-of-day; haul road dust control ROI; barrier placement
      guidance.
    - >-
      Data governance: secure data storage, audit trail, and export to EHS
      systems (e.g., Intelex, Sphera).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prove and improve compliance in real time. AeolianGuard fuses perimeter
    dust/noise sensor networks with on-site meteorology and AI source
    attribution to cut exceedances, reduce complaints, and auto-generate
    regulator-ready reports—saving 10–15+ hours/month/site and reducing
    compliance risk and cost.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, quarry-specific source attribution engine that fuses on-site
    wind, perimeter sensors, and operational telemetry to produce
    regulator-defensible confidence scores—paired with a library of
    jurisdiction-specific reporting templates and a QAPP-backed QA/QC workflow.
    Early partnerships with consultants and insurers create data network effects
    and preferred-vendor status.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quarry and crushed-stone operators (NAICS 212319)—plant, operations, and
    environmental/compliance managers who must meet dust and noise limits
    without slowing production.
  problem: >-
    External: shifting winds, mixed sources, and manual logs make exceedances
    hard to detect, attribute, and report—risking fines, shutdowns, and
    complaints. Internal: constant uncertainty and firefighting. Philosophical:
    compliance should be fact-based, fast, and fair—not a guessing game.
  guide: >-
    We understand quarry realities and regulator expectations. Field-tested in
    212319 sites, our AI fuses sensor networks with wind data to pinpoint
    sources, alert instantly, and auto-generate regulator-ready snapshots—so you
    stay ahead with defensible data.
  plan: >-
    1) Site assessment: place dust/noise and wind nodes. 2) Configure limits,
    sources, and geofences to match permits. 3) Go live: real-time exceedance
    alerts, source attribution, and auto-reporting. Optional 90-day pilot,
    training, API access, and clear data ownership.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a 90-day pilot. Transitional: Download a sample
    compliance snapshot and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Prove compliance with defensible data, cut reporting time up to 80%, reduce
    exceedances and complaints, target mitigation (water, curtains, timing),
    avoid fines, strengthen community trust, and keep production on schedule.
  failure: >-
    Without it: reactive response, disputed complaints, blanket over-mitigation
    costs, citations and shutdown risk, lost production, and strained community
    relations.

## Implementation Notes

The above TypeScript functions represent the core business processes for AeolianGuard's environmental monitoring platform. These functions are designed to be:

- **Modular**: Each function handles a specific business process
- **Composable**: Functions can call other functions to build complex workflows  
- **Type-safe**: Strong typing ensures data integrity across the system
- **Async**: All operations are asynchronous to handle real-time data processing
- **Error-handling**: Functions include proper error handling and validation

The workflows cover the complete customer lifecycle from acquisition through ongoing operations, regulatory compliance, and revenue optimization. The functions can be implemented using modern cloud infrastructure and integrated with existing quarry management systems.
