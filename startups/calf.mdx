  problem:
    - >-
      Dual-purpose (meat + milk) producers lack breed- and system-specific
      growth targets for calves, leading to inconsistent weaning ages and
      suboptimal performance.
    - >-
      Pre-weaning morbidity (scours, pneumonia, parasites) and missed
      vaccinations increase treatment costs, mortality, and delay weaning.
    - >-
      Data collection is fragmented (paper/Excel/WhatsApp), devices are not
      integrated (EID, scales), and connectivity is unreliable in rural areas.
    - >-
      Producers and vets lack timely, objective alerts to intervene on lagging
      calves before performance losses accrue.
    - >-
      Economic impact of delayed weaning and poor growth is not quantified for
      decision-making at the calf or batch level.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI growth and weaning-readiness scoring that benchmarks each calf/batch
      against breed, crossbreed, and system targets.
    - >-
      Automated alerts for lagging calves with prioritized, evidence-based
      interventions (nutrition, health, environment) and ROI impact per action.
    - >-
      Localized vaccination scheduler (by country/region, age, disease risk,
      sex) with inventory planning and compliance tracking.
    - >-
      Seamless data capture via Bluetooth scales/EID readers, photo-based weight
      estimation (where available), and manual inputs; robust offline mode with
      auto-sync.

      Action cards and checklists for chute-side work (vaccinations, deworming,
      tagging) and weaning step-down protocols.
    - >-
      Batch analytics: cohort comparisons, weaning age distribution,
      morbidity/mortality trends, cost per kg gain, and milk diversion savings.
    - >-
      Integrations/APIs with popular livestock tools (EID/scale brands, ranch
      management software) and WhatsApp/SMS for alerts in low-connectivity
      contexts.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Dual‑purpose cattle ranchers and farm managers who want every calf to hit
    growth and health milestones for on‑time, profitable weaning with less
    guesswork.
  problem: >-
    Calves quietly fall behind target weights; health risks are spotted late;
    records live in notebooks and scattered apps—leading to stress,
    unpredictable weaning dates, avoidable treatments, and missed revenue.
    Healthy, timely weaning shouldn’t be a guessing game.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of a missed weaning window. Our AI service—built with
    input from veterinarians and producers—continuously compares each calf’s
    growth and health against proven targets and local conditions, turning raw
    data into clear, timely guidance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import weights, birth dates, tags, pasture/feed info; optional
    sensor integrations. 2) Monitor: Track growth vs targets, auto‑build
    ranch‑specific vaccination/deworming schedules, flag lagging calves and risk
    clusters. 3) Act & Review: Receive prioritized alerts and interventions;
    verify outcomes pre‑weaning and refine protocols.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot with your next calf group. Transitional: Book a
    20‑minute demo with sample dashboards and ROI estimates.
  success: >-
    On‑time weaning at target weights, fewer sickness days, right‑time
    vaccinations, better feed allocation, focused labor, predictable cash flow,
    and clear, auditable records.
  failure: >-
    Avoid underweight or late‑weaned calves, preventable disease events,
    unnecessary antibiotic use, wasted feed and labor, and costly uncertainty
    from managing by feel.
