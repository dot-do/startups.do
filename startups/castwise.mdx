leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      PFMEA and Control Plan drafting is slow (typically 80–120 engineer-hours
      per new product/process and 20–40 hours per control plan) and often delays
      PPAP/APQP timelines.
    - >-
      Knowledge is trapped in spreadsheets and on shared drives; turnover leads
      to loss of institutional know‑how and inconsistent risk assessments.
    - >-
      Historical NCRs, scrap, and rework data are rarely structured or linked to
      FMEAs; recurring defects aren’t systematically de-risked.
    - >-
      Audit findings (IATF 16949/AS9100/ISO 9001) cite weak linkage between
      PFMEA and Control Plan, missing special characteristics, and poor revision
      control.
    - >-
      Consultants and senior SMEs are expensive bottlenecks for initial drafting
      and cross-plant standardization.
    - >-
      Generic FMEA software lacks die-casting-specific defect libraries
      (porosity types, cold shuts, soldering, die erosion, misrun, blistering,
      inclusions, flash, dimensional drift) and recommended controls.
    - >-
      Manual document versioning increases errors; changes in process maps or
      work instructions don’t reliably cascade to PFMEA/Control Plan updates.
    - >-
      Suppliers face OEM pressure for AIAG/VDA-compliant formats and faster PPAP
      submissions; late changes create expedite costs and premium freight.
    - >-
      Small/mid-size foundries lack data engineering capacity to utilize
      NCR/SPC/MES data in risk analysis.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop learning: lessons from 8D/CAPA and audits don’t
      consistently update future FMEAs and control strategies.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion: Connect to QMS/MES/ERP/SPC (e.g., ETQ, Plex,
      DELMIAWorks/IQMS, SAP QM, Oracle, InfinityQS, Minitab) plus import
      Visio/Lucidchart process maps, routings, and NCR/CAPA history.
    - >-
      Die-casting domain model: Pre-trained ontology for aluminum, zinc, and
      magnesium die casting processes (melt, ladling/shot, die spray,
      fill/solidification, ejection, trimming/deburring, machining, leak test,
      finishing), typical machines, tools, and inspection methods.
    - >-
      Draft generation: Create AIAG/VDA 7-step PFMEA artifacts (structure
      analysis, function, failure analysis, risk analysis, optimization) and a
      linked Control Plan with detection/prevention controls and special
      characteristics (CC/SC) based on customer/print CTQs.
    - >-
      Risk scoring: Propose S/O/D or AIAG Action Priority using NCR frequencies,
      SPC capability (Cpk/Ppk), scrap/rework codes, and defect severities for
      the specific customer/end-use (auto vs aerospace).
    - >-
      Control recommendations: Suggest prevention/detection controls by defect
      type (e.g., vacuum-assisted fill, die temperature control, gate redesign
      flags, leak testing parameters, X-ray, CT, vision, torque checks), with
      parameter ranges and sampling plans.
    - >-
      Traceability: Maintain digital thread linking print requirements, PFMEA
      items, controls, gages, work instructions, and validation evidence for
      PPAP levels 1–5.
    - >-
      SME-in-the-loop: Route drafts to designated SMEs for review/edits; capture
      rationales and lock approved baselines by program and revision.
    - >-
      Change management: Auto-flag ripple effects when process maps, tooling, or
      materials change; propose PFMEA/Control Plan updates and redlines for
      approval.
    - >-
      Compliance packaging: Export AIAG/VDA-compliant forms, OEM templates
      (GM/Ford/Stellantis variants), and registrar-ready audit trails.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: After each NCR/8D, prompt updates and re-score risks;
      maintain cross-plant library of lessons learned and best-practice
      controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-ready, AIAG/VDA-compliant PFMEAs and linked Control Plans in
    hours, not weeks, by ingesting your process maps, NCR history, SPC, and
    standard die-casting defect libraries—kept current via SME review and
    automated change propagation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, continuously learned die-casting defect and control knowledge
    base linked to real plant NCR/SPC data—combined with AIAG/VDA-compliant
    drafting automation and deep integrations—yields faster, audit-ready outputs
    other generic FMEA tools or LLMs can’t match. Early partnerships with NADCA
    and QMS vendors provide trust, templates, and distribution leverage.

  character: >-
    Quality/Process Engineering leaders at Nonferrous Metal Die-Casting
    Foundries (NAICS 331523) who want audit-ready PFMEAs and Control Plans
    fast—without reinventing them for every part, launch, or customer.
  problem: >-
    - External: Compressed PPAP/APQP timelines, customer-specific formats, and
    audit pressure (IATF/ISO).

    - Internal: Siloed know-how, inconsistent PFMEAs/Control Plans, and hours
    lost copy-pasting NCR learnings.

    - Philosophical: Engineering time should improve the process—not retype the
    documentation.
  guide: >-
    We understand die-casting realities—porosity, cold shuts, flash, tool wear,
    and machine variability—while wrestling with audits and launches. Built with
    die-casting SMEs, our assistant uses process maps, NCR history, and standard
    defect libraries to draft PFMEAs and Control Plans aligned to AIAG/VDA
    structures, with version control and review trails.
  plan: >-
    - 1) Connect inputs: upload process map, NCR history, and choose defect
    libraries.

    - 2) Auto-draft: generate PFMEA (functions, failure modes, effects, causes,
    controls) and a matching Control Plan.

    - 3) Review & release: route to SMEs, capture edits/approvals, export to
    your customer’s format.

    Agreement: You retain final approval; secure data handling; full
    traceability of changes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot with one part family or book a 30‑minute demo.

    Transitional: Download a sample PFMEA/Control Plan and an ROI/time-savings
    estimator.
  success: >-
    - Consistent, audit-ready PFMEAs/Control Plans aligned to real shop-floor
    risks.

    - Faster launches and PPAP packages with fewer findings.

    - Institutionalized learnings from NCRs; less defect recurrence.

    - Clear linkage between detection/prevention controls and process steps.

    - Traceable revisions and SME accountability.
  failure: |-
    - Late PPAPs, audit nonconformities, and rework.
    - Inconsistent controls across similar processes and plants.
    - Repeat defects due to missed historical learnings.
    - Lost time and know-how when key people are unavailable.
