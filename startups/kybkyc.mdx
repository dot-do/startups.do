leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Median business customer onboarding time is 5–20 business days due to
      fragmented tools (IDV, sanctions/PEP, adverse media, UBO lookup, manual
      risk scoring).
    - >-
      High false positives (20–60%) from sanctions/adverse media tools overwhelm
      analysts; evidence is scattered across screenshots and PDFs, causing QA
      rework and audit findings.
    - >-
      UBO/ownership resolution across multi-layered entities is slow and
      error-prone; many banks struggle to document a defensible approach for
      complex structures and foreign entities.
    - >-
      Inconsistent policy application and lack of audit-ready evidence packs
      drive MRAs/consent orders and remediation costs.
    - >-
      Vendor sprawl (5–10 systems + Excel/email) increases per-case cost and
      causes swivel-chair inefficiencies; integrating new providers requires
      months and vendor management overhead.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (BSA/AML, FinCEN CDD, OFAC, 314(a), OCC/FDIC
      expectations) is increasing while budgets and headcount are constrained.
  solution:
    - >-
      Orchestrate identity, sanctions/PEP, adverse media, and corporate registry
      data via pre-built connectors; support BYO data contracts or bundled data.
    - >-
      Automated document ingestion (KYC forms, corporate docs) with OCR,
      classification, and entity extraction; human-in-the-loop validation for
      critical fields.
    - >-
      Entity resolution across sources to deduplicate and link people/entities;
      build transparent UBO ownership graphs with depth/percentages and
      jurisdiction flags.
    - >-
      Configurable, policy-mapped risk scoring engine aligned to each bank’s
      risk appetite and FinCEN CDD rule; supports rules + explainable models.
    - >-
      Evidence pack generator outputs standardized PDF/JSON with citations,
      timestamps, screenshots/hash proofs, and retention metadata; one-click
      export to case systems.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and periodic reviews: re-screening, adverse media
      refresh, and delta-based updates to the evidence pack.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate a complete, audit-ready CIP/KYB/KYC evidence pack (IDV,
    sanctions/PEP, adverse media, UBO graph, and policy-aligned risk score) in
    minutes, not days—reducing manual touches 50–70%, false positives 20–40%,
    and QA rework 30–50%, with full explainability and regulator-ready audit
    trails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A regulator-ready evidence pack engine with explainable scoring, UBO
    graphing, and policy templates pre-mapped to US BSA/AML and FinCEN
    CDD—combined with deep integrations into incumbent data and case
    systems—enables faster audits, quicker bank onboarding, and lower
    change-management friction than point solutions. Early pilots and benchmark
    datasets for adverse media and UBO resolution create defensible performance
    baselines.
