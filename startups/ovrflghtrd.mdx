  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers and trip support coordinators spend 30–60 minutes per leg
      researching permit/slot/overflight rules that vary by country, airport,
      aircraft registry, operator type, and route.
    - >-
      Lead times are inconsistent (e.g., India 7 business days, Saudi Arabia
      3–5, Nigeria 72 hours, Brazil 48–72 hours, event-driven slots same day)
      and change frequently, causing missed windows and reroutes.
    - >-
      Manual email/PDF form preparation to CAAs, slot coordinators, and handlers
      creates error risk (wrong format, missing attachments, wrong time
      zone/daylight saving offsets).
    - >-
      Deadlines fall across time zones and local public holidays, leading to
      late submissions and fines, diversions, or ground delays
      ($6,000–$15,000/hour cost of delay for business jets).
    - >-
      Operators rely on scattered sources (AIPs/NOTAMs, WhatsApp groups, legacy
      SOPs), resulting in outdated guidance and single points of failure in the
      OCC.
    - >-
      No unified system to track permit/slot status, SLA clocks, and reminders;
      follow-ups get buried in email threads.
    - >-
      During peak events (e.g., Davos, World Cup, Cannes, Formula 1), slot/PPR
      scarcity and special procedures overwhelm small teams.
    - >-
      Regulators increasingly expect auditable records of submissions/approvals;
      current spreadsheets and inboxes are not audit-ready.
  solution:
    - >-
      Global rules engine: determines permit/slot/PPR/transit requirements by
      country/airport/route, aircraft registry/MTOW, operator type, and mission
      (commercial vs private).
    - >-
      Lead time intelligence: predicts submission windows and backsolves
      deadlines accounting for business days, local holidays, and office hours.
    - >-
      Smart document builder: auto-fills regulator-specific forms, email
      templates, and required attachments; exports to PDF/Word; supports
      multilingual salutations and time zones.
    - >-
      Status tracking and escalations: parses inbound/outbound emails to update
      statuses, start SLA timers, and trigger reminders/escalations.
    - >-
      Calendar and comms integrations: pushes key deadlines to Outlook/Google
      Calendars; sends updates to Teams/Slack; assigns owners per task/leg.
    - >-
      Evidence and audit: stores submissions, approvals, timestamps, references
      to AIPs/NOTAMs; exports audit packs for QA/regulatory inspections.
    - >-
      Event/exception modules: special procedures for high-demand events and
      airports; alerts for pop-up NOTAMs affecting permits or slots.
    - >-
      API/embeds: REST API and web components for FMS/dispatch platforms to
      embed requirement determinations and lead-time calculators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss a permit, slot, or overflight again: accurate requirements in
    minutes, auto-prepared forms/emails, live status tracking, and deadline
    calendaring—reducing per-leg coordination time by 70%+ and increasing
    on-time approvals to 99%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A living, cited dataset of global permit/slot/overflight rules with feedback
    loops from thousands of real submissions, improving lead-time predictions
    and templates over time; embedded in dispatch workflows via integrations,
    creating high switching costs and a proprietary accuracy moat.
