leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected lag or stuck fermentations lead to yield losses of 1–5% and
      full-batch write-offs ($5k–$50k per batch depending on mash bill and
      volume).
    - >-
      Current monitoring is manual/periodic (e.g., twice-daily gravity/pH
      checks), causing 8–24 hour detection delays for deviations, especially
      nights/weekends.
    - >-
      Variability in yeast health, mash composition, and ambient temperature
      leads to inconsistent cycle times (±10–20%), disrupting downstream
      scheduling (distillation runs, CIP, labor).
    - >-
      Contamination risk (wild yeast/bacteria) is hard to quantify early; most
      facilities detect late via sensory or lab tests, increasing rework and
      losses.
    - >-
      Data from sensors, SCADA, and ERP are siloed; no predictive layer
      translating data into prioritized, SOP-aligned actions for operators.
    - >-
      Smaller and mid-size distilleries lack in-house data science or QA
      resources to build/maintain predictive models.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time and historical fermentation data (temp, gravity/density,
      CO2 evolution, pH, ORP, DO) from existing sensors/SCADA or optional
      drop-in sensors.
    - >-
      Model baselines per mash bill, yeast strain, pitch rate, and seasonality;
      continuously learn normal curves and acceptable variance bands.
    - >-
      Predictive alerts for lag/stuck/over-attenuation and contamination risk,
      with confidence scores and estimated time-to-threshold breach.
    - >-
      Action recommendations mapped to distillery SOPs (e.g., adjust setpoint
      profile, oxygenation, nutrient additions, repitch guidance), with expected
      impact ranges.
    - >-
      Operator workflow: mobile/desktop alerts, one-tap acknowledgment,
      intervention logging, and post-batch RCA with contribution analysis.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: quantify saved hours, yield recovered, reduced dump/rework
      events, and schedule adherence improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time fermentation health scoring and alerts tailored to distilleries
    that cut detection time from hours to minutes, reduce batch failures by
    30–50%, and increase yield by 1–2% with sensor-agnostic AI and SOP-ready
    recommendations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, labeled dataset of distillery-specific fermentations (grain,
    molasses, agave) with intervention-outcome pairs, enabling higher-precision
    predictions and actionable recommendations than brewery-focused or generic
    anomaly tools; reinforced by OEM and supplier partnerships embedding our
    models into workflows.
