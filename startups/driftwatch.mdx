  problem:
    - >-
      RIAs and family offices operate across multiple custodians; consolidating
      holdings, cash flows, and corporate actions into a reconciled view is
      manual, error-prone, and slow (often T+1/T+2).
    - >-
      Performance reporting is inconsistent: firms mix TWR and MWR, benchmarks
      are poorly mapped, and exposure/risk reporting is superficial or siloed.
    - >-
      Portfolio drift vs. IPS targets is detected late (quarterly/annual
      reviews), causing avoidable tracking error and tax-inefficient
      rebalancing.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either heavy, expensive platforms with long
      implementations (3–9 months) or lightweight aggregators lacking portfolio
      analytics and alerting.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (Reg BI, fiduciary duty) requires ongoing monitoring
      and documentation that firms struggle to automate.
    - >-
      Advisors lack real-time, actionable alerts and have to dig through
      dashboards rather than receiving prioritized, explainable recommendations.
    - >-
      Fintechs and digital advisors need an API-first way to add portfolio
      monitoring without building and maintaining hundreds of custodian/broker
      integrations.
    - >-
      Operations teams need auditability and data lineage to satisfy SOC
      2/client audits; most systems are opaque.
    - >-
      Firms experience data breaks from stale feeds, ticker/cusip changes, and
      complex assets (alts, ETFs-of-ETFs) with inadequate reconciliation
      tooling.
  solution:
    - >-
      Normalize and reconcile holdings, transactions, and corporate actions from
      top custodians and data aggregators into a single golden record per
      account/household.
    - >-
      Compute daily time-weighted and money-weighted performance, benchmark
      mapping, and exposures (sector, region, factor) with transparent
      methodology.
    - >-
      Continuously monitor drift vs. IPS targets with configurable bands and
      thresholds; flag breaches and propose tax-aware rebalancing suggestions.
    - >-
      Deliver explainable alerts via email/SMS/Slack and push to CRM/task
      systems; provide heatmaps and dashboards for advisors, ops, and
      compliance.
    - >-
      Offer a secure, well-documented API and webhooks for fintechs to embed
      aggregation, performance, exposures, and alerts into their products.
    - >-
      Provide SOC 2 Type II-grade security, audit logs, and data lineage to
      satisfy client and regulator expectations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, multi-custodian portfolio aggregation with reconciled performance
    and AI-driven drift alerts that cut tracking error and review time by 50%+,
    delivered via compliant dashboards and an API-first platform that onboards
    in under 30 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, custodian-agnostic normalization and reconciliation engine
    with explainable AI drift detection, delivering higher data accuracy (≥99.5%
    statement match) and lower alert latency than legacy platforms, packaged
    with an API-first architecture and SOC 2 Type II program—creating switching
    costs through data mappings, workflows, and integrations embedded into
    advisor operations.
