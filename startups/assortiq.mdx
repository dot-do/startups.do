  problem:
    - >-
      Missed demand at the size–color level due to stockouts and pack-size
      mismatches leads to 1–4% lost sales per door annually.
    - >-
      Planners lack granular, door-level size curves by gender/category/season;
      existing tools aggregate too broadly, causing overstock in slow sizes and
      persistent gaps in core sizes.
    - >-
      Reorders don’t reflect real vendor constraints (MOQs, pack assortments,
      lead times), resulting in late or suboptimal POs and higher markdowns at
      season end.
    - >-
      Substitutable products (by silhouette/brand/price band) are not surfaced
      in time, so store staff and ecom fail to convert shoppers when a specific
      size-color is out.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across POS, ecom, WMS, and vendor systems; Excel-driven
      workflows are slow, error-prone, and make it hard to run weekly
      buy/replenishment cycles.
    - >-
      Omnichannel demand (BOPIS/ship-from-store) distorts local sell-through if
      not modeled, causing wrong allocations and late rebalance decisions.
    - >-
      Retailers struggle to quantify missed demand and ROI on replenishment
      decisions, weakening vendor negotiations and open-to-buy planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion connectors unify POS/ecom/WMS/vendor EDI to build a clean,
      time-aligned SKU–store–size–color demand view.
    - >-
      Missed-demand detection quantifies lost sales by size–color using stockout
      intervals, substitution behavior, click data, and price elasticity.
    - >-
      Door-level size curve modeling auto-learns per category/brand/season, with
      climate/region clustering and width handling where applicable.
    - >-
      Reorder recommender generates optimal quantities by SKU–store (or
      cluster), respecting lead times, MOQs, vendor pack assortments, and
      open-to-buy.
    - >-
      Substitution engine surfaces in-stock alternates (by silhouette/fit/price
      band) and brand-crosswalks to preserve conversion when a target SKU–size
      is out.
    - >-
      PO builder and scenario simulator let planners compare outcomes (recovered
      sales, GM$, weeks of supply, stockout risk) before committing.
    - >-
      Assortment gap heatmaps and alerts flag persistent misses and slow movers;
      suggest rebalance/transfers within a district to rebalance stock.
    - >-
      Optional drop-ship/marketplace bridge: when reorders miss the window,
      trigger substitute fulfillment via approved vendors to capture demand.
    - >-
      A/B testing framework assigns control/test stores to attribute recovered
      sales and markdown reduction to recommendations.
    - >-
      APIs/exports push orders to ERP/EDI and publish recommendations to store
      apps or client dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover 1–3% of revenue and lift gross margin 50–150 bps in 12 weeks by
    eliminating size–color stockouts and optimizing reorders—purpose-built for
    footwear (sizes, widths, vendor packs), live in 2–4 weeks, with
    performance-backed pricing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Footwear-specialized models and ontology (sizes/widths/packs) trained on
    cross-retailer patterns, enabling accurate door-level size curves and
    substitution recommendations out of the box; fast time-to-value via prebuilt
    connectors and a proven A/B attribution framework that ties recommendations
    to recovered sales.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      size-curve/replenishment layer alongside ERP/merch systems.
    - >-
      Omnichannel footwear retailers with both stores and ecom (including
      workwear, comfort, fashion, and athletic specialty).
