  problem:
    - >-
      Manual finish carpentry QA/QC is slow (2–4 hours per unit or 3,000–5,000
      sq ft) and highly subjective, leading to inconsistent punchlists and
      disputes.
    - >-
      Defects like misaligned reveals, miter gaps, and unfilled nail holes are
      often caught late (post-paint/turnover), causing expensive rework and
      schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Existing photo/360 documentation tools don’t automatically detect finish
      defects or translate them into location-tagged, spec-referenced punch
      items.
    - >-
      Subs lack standardized, measurable tolerances in the field; specs live in
      PDFs while inspections rely on eyeballing and tape measures.
    - >-
      General contractors/developers need consistent quality reporting across
      multiple subs and projects but can’t enforce uniform QA processes without
      added headcount.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision models trained on finish carpentry defects analyze mobile
      and 360 captures to detect: miter/corner gaps, inconsistent casing
      reveals, base/crown misalignment, out-of-plane cabinet faces, unfilled
      nail holes, missing/insufficient fasteners, scribe/caulk gaps.
    - >-
      Generate auto punchlists with pin locations on floor plans or 360
      panoramas; each item includes annotated imagery, measured deviation
      (mm/inch), and linked tolerance/spec reference.
    - >-
      One-tap sync to Procore/Autodesk Build observations; status tracking
      through closeout with before/after photo verification.
    - >-
      Configurable tolerance engine (e.g., reveal ±1.5 mm, miter gap ≤1.6 mm)
      mapped to project specs/AWI/CSI standards by trade scope.
    - >-
      Lightweight capture workflow: guided shot list, QR/AprilTag markers or 360
      SLAM for localization; hands-free mode compatible with 360 cameras (Ricoh
      Theta, Insta360).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that turns site photos/360s into measurable, location-tagged punchlists
    for finish carpentry—catching gaps, misalignments, and reveal issues early,
    cutting rework by 30–50% and standardizing quality to spec.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific dataset and tolerance engine for finish carpentry (not
    generic site CV), combined with on-site workflows and integrations that turn
    detections into actionable, spec-referenced punchlists. Continuous learning
    from reviewer feedback across projects creates a compounding accuracy moat.
