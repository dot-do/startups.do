leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Coater drift (power supply aging, target erosion, gas flow shifts, vacuum
      variability) causes optical and electrical properties to drift out of spec
      between scheduled checks, leading to scrap and rework.
    - >-
      Run cards (recipes) frequently lag actual equipment behavior; engineers
      manually tweak offsets with limited traceability, causing inconsistent
      outcomes across shifts and lines.
    - >-
      Detection latency: In many plants, issues are only visible after lab/XRF
      confirmation or customer complaints; mean time to detect drift can exceed
      4–8 hours or multiple coils/lites.
    - >-
      No automated validation that a proposed run card will achieve target
      optical stack; recipe review is manual and slow, especially for
      multi-layer Low‑E stacks (>10 layers).
    - >-
      Inefficient changeovers and recipe porting across lines/coaters; engineers
      spend hours re-deriving offsets per line and substrate type.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely time-based (e.g., target swaps every N hours)
      rather than condition-based; premature or late maintenance increases cost
      and defect risk.
    - >-
      Limited version control and auditability of run card changes; difficult to
      satisfy customer and internal traceability requirements during audits.
    - >-
      Skill gap: experienced process engineers and coaters retire; tribal
      knowledge is not codified into repeatable decision support.
  solution:
    - >-
      Industrial connectors ingest coater data (PLC/SCADA via OPC UA/Modbus,
      historian tags, inline optical monitors, sheet resistance, vacuum, gas
      flows, power, line speed) and lab/XRF results.
    - >-
      Digital thread links each lot/coil/lite to the exact run card version and
      setpoints; automatic recipe parsing for layer stacks and target
      thicknesses.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models learn each line’s drift signatures (e.g.,
      target utilization curves, cathode zones, gas stabilization) and predict
      impact on optical/electrical targets.
    - >-
      Run card validator simulates expected results and flags risks before
      production; proposes quantified setpoint offsets and line-speed changes
      with confidence bounds.
    - >-
      Prescriptive maintenance engine triggers checks (e.g., target swap,
      cathode cleaning, leak checks) based on condition, not calendar; links to
      checklists and CMMS.
    - >-
      Change management workflow: propose → review → approve → apply; full audit
      trail with e-signatures and rollback; read-only by default, optional
      closed loop under MOC.
    - >-
      Dashboards for engineers and operators: live drift score, predicted
      next‑run Cp/Cpk, recommended offsets, and expected scrap risk;
      notifications via email/MES.
    - >-
      Edge-first deployment aligned to ISA/IEC 62443; cloud optional for fleet
      analytics, benchmarking, and model improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut scrap and changeover time by validating coater run cards against target
    properties and proactively recommending offsets and maintenance based on
    physics-informed AI tuned to your specific line—deployed safely on an
    industrial edge with measurable ROI in under 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary library of physics-informed, coater-specific ML models and
    drift signatures calibrated across multiple lines, combined with prebuilt
    industrial connectors and a validated run card linting engine that ties
    recommendations to audit-ready change workflows—reducing time-to-value to
    weeks rather than quarters.

    Coating line managers and process/quality engineers in flat glass plants who
    need every run to hit optical/electrical targets on time and on cost.
  problem: >-
    Magnetron sputter coaters drift and run cards go stale; small shifts in
    power, pressure, gas mix, and line speed compound into off‑spec stacks,
    scrap, rework, firefighting, and missed shipments.
  guide: >-
    We’re a manufacturing AI team with deep sputter expertise; we’ve stabilized
    coater drift, raised FPY, and passed audits—securely integrating with
    PLC/MES and OT networks while respecting SOPs and change control.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PLC/MES plus inline and lab data. 2) Baseline product targets and
    control limits. 3) Validate run cards and monitor drift 24/7. 4) Get precise
    recipe offsets and maintenance checks. 5) Approve changes, implement, and
    track yield/uptime gains.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute demo and data readiness review; start a 4‑week pilot on
    one coater.
  success: >-
    Stable color and sheet resistance, higher first‑pass yield, less scrap and
    rework, faster changeovers, extended target life, and audit‑ready
    traceability with confident, proactive operators.
  failure: >-
    Without it: continued drift, QA surprises, reruns and scrap, unplanned
    downtime, missed deliveries, and shrinking margins.

  problem:
    - >-
      Drift in magnetron targets and gas delivery causes color and Rs shifts
      caught too late.
    - Run cards are approved manually and inconsistently across shifts.
    - >-
      Offsets rely on tribal knowledge; over- or under-compensation creates
      scrap.
    - Maintenance is reactive; shields and targets run to failure.
    - 'SPC and audits are slow; data is split across SCADA, MES, and LIMS.'
    - Changeovers risk mis-sets and missed guard bands.
    - Engineers spend hours reconciling spectro and 4PP data with line settings.
  solution:
    - >-
      Validate every run card against current tool state and product targets in
      seconds.
    - 'Detect drift early and auto-recommend power, gas, and speed offsets.'
    - Gate runs with digital guard bands; release only when in-window.
    - Trigger maintenance based on offset magnitude and model confidence.
    - >-
      Unify SCADA, MES, and lab data with a single source of truth and audit
      trail.
    - >-
      Cut scrap, boost first-pass yield, and stabilize color and Rs across
      shifts.

    - Real-time drift models per cathode and zone.

    - Lot and panel-level traceability linking settings to results.
    - 'Secure deployment: on-prem or VPC; IT-friendly, no PII.'
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect: Ingest SCADA tags, MES run cards, and lab measurements; map to
      products and zones.
    - >-
      Baseline: Train drift models from recent runs; set guard bands and
      tolerances.
    - 'Validate: Auto-check each run card against current drift and targets.'
    - >-
      Recommend: Generate offsets and highlight risks; simulate expected
      results.
