leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Weather volatility shifts in-season N need; static blanket rates cause
      over- or under-application by 10–40 lb N/ac, leading to lost profit or
      leaching risk.
    - >-
      Nitrogen cost volatility ($0.55–$0.80/lb N) and typical total N ~160–220
      lb/ac means a 10% misallocation costs $9–$18/ac.
    - >-
      Time-critical sidedress window (V4–V10) and data silos (as-applied, soil,
      imagery, weather) make timely, zone-specific decisions difficult.
    - >-
      Last-mile friction: Rx files fail on machines or ignore operational
      constraints (min/max rates, jump rates), causing low adoption.
    - >-
      Limited, local proof and transparency reduces trust; growers need
      measurable ROI and clear agronomic rationale by zone.
    - >-
      Emerging sustainability/CI requirements (ethanol, CPG Scope 3) create
      reporting burden without tools to monetize improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse process-based crop modeling with ML to estimate EONR per zone using
      soil (texture/OM/CEC), weather, crop vigor, and as-applied N.
    - >-
      Auto-generate machine-ready VRA sidedress Rx (ISOXML/Shapefile/Deere .jd)
      honoring equipment constraints and buffers.
    - >-
      Trigger alerts after rainfall/GDD thresholds; one-click approve/push to
      machines; rollback and versioning.
    - >-
      Provide transparent recommendation reports: N credits (manure/legume),
      risk bands, expected ROI per zone, and tissue/soil sampling guidance.
    - >-
      Integrate with FieldView, John Deere Ops Center, AgLeader SMS, Raven
      Slingshot for seamless ingest/export.
    - >-
      Run automated on-farm replicated strip trials to quantify local ROI and
      continuously calibrate models.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Zone-specific, weather-updated sidedress nitrogen prescriptions that target
    economic optimum N and deliver measurable profit: 10–25 lb N/ac reduction
    without yield loss and/or +1–3 bu/ac recovery where needed, with an ROI
    guarantee of +$8/ac or better. Zero-friction delivery to
    Deere/CNH/Trimble/Raven within 24 hours of a trigger rain event, plus
    MRV-ready reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A closed-loop dataset from retailer networks linking as-applied N,
    high-frequency imagery, weather, and yield across millions of acres enables
    rapid, local calibration and uncertainty-aware EONR. Operational capability
    to deliver validated, equipment-ready prescriptions within 24 hours of
    weather triggers, plus built-in MRV workflows that translate agronomic gains
    into monetizable sustainability payments.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Corn growers and agronomists (NAICS 111150) who want reliable, profitable
    in-season nitrogen decisions and simple VRA execution.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather swings, variable soils, and uncertain mineralization make
    fixed-rate N wasteful; data sits in silos and VRA is hard to operationalize.
    Internal: You feel unsure—risking yield with too little N or overspending
    with too much. Philosophical: Stewardship and profitability should go
    hand-in-hand, and N decisions should be data-driven and easy.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of making high-stakes N calls
    mid-season. Authority: Proven AI blending weather, crop vigor imagery, soil,
    and applied N to target economic optimum N (EONR); validated with on-farm
    trials and university-calibrated approaches; integrates with common monitors
    and platforms.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect fields and data (boundaries, soil, as-applied,
    imagery/weather). 2) Calibrate zones and growth stage. 3) AI computes
    zone-level EONR with price/yield sensitivity. 4) Export equipment-ready VRA
    sidedress Rx and update as conditions change. Agreement: Transparent
    assumptions, you own your data, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 15-minute onboarding and receive your first VRA sidedress
    Rx. Transitional: Get a free field N risk snapshot and sample zone map.
  success: >-
    Make confident, timely N applications; lift profit per acre; reduce N per
    bushel; stay resilient to weather; document stewardship for audits; and
    establish a repeatable, scalable in-season N playbook.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing with flat rates—overspend on N, leave yield on the table,
    increase nitrate loss and regulatory exposure, and endure volatile margins.

      AI turns weather, crop vigor, soils, and as‑applied data into zone-by-zone
      N rates that target economic optimum N.
    ctaText: Start free trial
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - Static N rates ignore in-season weather and crop variability.
    - Blanket sidedress over-applies in weak zones and starves strong ones.

    - Manual scouting and spreadsheets don’t scale across fields.
    - Unclear ROI from extra N leads to costly guesswork.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic, in-season N recs by management zone using real weather, crop
      vigor, soil, and applied N.
    - >-
      Variable-rate sidedress prescriptions that target economic optimum N for
      profit protection.
    - >-
      Continuous updates after storms or heat to keep rates aligned with crop
      demand.
    - Field-ready Rx files for major controllers—load and go.
    - 'Clear ROI, N-use efficiency, and risk insights for confident decisions.'
  features:
    - >-
      Zone-level AI model blends rainfall, GDD, ET, soils, vigor indices
      (NDVI/NDRE), and as‑applied N.
    - Economic engine tunes rates to your corn price and N cost to hit EONR.
    - >-
      Automated VRA prescriptions with min/max caps, increments, and buffer
      zones.
    - >-
      Seamless data flow with John Deere Ops Center, Climate FieldView, Ag

      applications.
    - 'Alerting when fields deviate from plan (excess rain, stress signals).'
    - Per‑zone confidence bands and what‑if scenarios before you roll.
    - Batch processing for whole farms; API and bulk upload options.
    - 'Privacy-first: your farm data stays yours with enterprise-grade security.'
    - >-
      Harvest closeout reports: N efficiency, profit per acre, sustainability
      metrics.
  steps:
    - Connect fields and as‑applied N (or import from your ops platform).
    - Set corn price and N cost; choose rate caps and increments.
    - Review zone maps and EONR scenarios; approve the plan.
    - Export Rx files and send to your controller.
    - Sidedress and sync actuals; get updated recs after major weather events.
