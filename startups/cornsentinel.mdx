  problem:
    - >-
      Diseases like tar spot, gray leaf spot, and southern rust escalate
      quickly; many growers detect too late to justify fungicide timing, losing
      3–10 bu/ac.
    - >-
      Pest scouting (e.g., western bean cutworm, black cutworm, corn rootworm
      adults) is time-consuming and inconsistent across fields; limited labor
      leads to missed hotspots.
    - >-
      Existing advisories are regional; they don’t reflect field-level
      microclimates, hybrid maturity, planting date, or management history,
      causing false alarms or missed events.
    - >-
      Growers and agronomy retailers lack a ranked, defendable plan for where to
      scout first each week and how to justify spray decisions to stakeholders
      and insurers.
    - >-
      Imagery-only tools produce too many non-actionable alerts (dust, nutrient
      issues) and aren’t linked to phenology or weather risk models, leading to
      alert fatigue.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across weather, imagery, traps, and farm platforms;
      there’s no simple, integrated workflow that ties alerts to scouting tasks,
      routes, and records.
  solution:
    - >-
      Corn-specific risk models that fuse GDD phenology, localized weather,
      historical outbreaks, and 10 m satellite spectral anomalies to produce
      field-level risk scores.
    - >-
      Automated hotspot maps and weekly prioritized scout lists with route
      optimization and in-app checklists tied to each risk.
    - >-
      Event-specific alerts (e.g., WBC egg hatch risk window, black cutworm
      cutting risk, rootworm adult emergence, tar spot favorability) with
      suggested thresholds and sampling protocols.
    - >-
      Within-field heatmaps to direct scouting to the highest-probability zones
      and record geo-tagged observations/photos.
    - >-
      ROI and timing module estimating yield at risk, cost of application, and
      probability of response to support spray/no-spray decisions.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with John Deere Operations Center, Climate
      FieldView, and popular retailer ERPs/CRM for seamless data flow and
      billing.
    - >-
      Pilot deployment and calibration workflows to tune models to local
      hybrids, planting windows, and management history.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, field-level early warnings and hotspot maps for key corn pests
    and diseases that prioritize where to scout first, 3–7 days ahead of typical
    detection, combining GDD-driven phenology, microclimate weather, and
    spectral anomaly signals—delivered as ranked tasks, routes, and ROI-backed
    recommendations that integrate with existing farm platforms at a low
    per-acre cost.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop improvement flywheel: retailer/co-op partnerships feed
    geo-tagged scouting labels and treatment outcomes back into CornSentinel’s
    models at scale, generating localized phenology calibrations and
    cost-response curves that competitors without deep retailer access cannot
    easily replicate. Combined with a corn-specific feature set, route-level
    tasking, and low per-acre cost, this creates defensible accuracy and
    distribution advantages.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Corn growers, farm managers, and crop advisors who need to protect yield and
    prioritize limited scouting time without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    Pests and diseases (rootworm, armyworm, cutworm; gray leaf spot, NCLB, tar
    spot, rust) emerge fast and patchy. Weather and GDD shift risk windows by
    field. Scouting is stretched thin, causing missed hotspots, late treatments,
    and unnecessary sprays.
  guide: >-
    We get the pressure of narrow spray windows and tight margins. Our
    agronomy-led AI combines GDD models, local weather, and spectral anomaly
    detection to flag risk early and map hotspots—aligned with IPM best
    practices and your existing workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect fields and boundaries; set varieties and planting dates. 2)
    Receive automated alerts and hotspot maps triggered by GDD, weather, and
    spectral signals. 3) Prioritize scouting and act with confidence; document
    decisions for IPM and audits.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30-day pilot on your top fields. Book a 15-minute demo
    today. Transitional: Download the regional corn pest timing guide and sample
    hotspot report.
  success: >-
    See issues earlier, scout where it matters, and treat on time. Reduce
    unnecessary passes, protect yield and margin, and gain audit-ready IPM
    records—all with clear, field-level risk visibility.
  failure: >-
    Keep flying blind—missed infestations, late sprays, wasted scouting time,
    resistant pressure, and preventable yield loss.

  problem:
    - Outbreaks escalate faster than crews can scout every acre.
    - Missed treatment windows cut yield and inflate costs.
    - Blanket scouting and spraying wastes time and chemistry.
    - Weather and GDD signals are underused in daily decisions.
    - Scattered notes make it hard to prioritize fields and teams.
    - Labor is tight during critical crop stages.
  solution:
    - 'Proactive, field-specific alerts before symptoms are obvious.'
    - Hotspot maps that direct scouts to the highest-risk zones first.
    - 'Treatment timing aligned to phenology thresholds, not guesswork.'
    - Objective risk scores to support confident go/no-go decisions.
    - Streamlined scouting workflows and clean season-long records.
