  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from artificial lift and facility upsets (ESPs, rod
      pumps, gas lift, separators, compressors) causes deferred production and
      costly workovers.
    - >-
      SCADA alarms are noisy and rule-based; true anomalies are detected late or
      buried in false positives, increasing MTTR and OPEX.
    - >-
      Field teams are stretched; they need prescriptive first actions, not just
      alerts, to reduce truck rolls and nighttime callouts.
    - >-
      Anomalies (carryover, liquid loading, separator pressure excursions) lead
      to flaring/methane events, impacting regulatory fees and ESG KPIs.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented (SCADA, PI/AF, historian, PLCs) and connectivity
      varies; operators need low-latency detection that works at the edge with
      unreliable links.
    - >-
      Traditional analytics projects are long and expensive; operators need
      weeks-to-value and measurable, contract-backed outcomes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Streaming, multivariate anomaly detection for wells and facilities (1–2
      minute latency) with probabilistic root-cause ranking and recommended
      first actions.
    - >-
      Edge+cloud architecture: run lightweight models at the pad/facility (OPC
      UA/Modbus/ MQTT/PI) with cloud training and fleet benchmarking.
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks mapped to failure modes (e.g., gas interference,
      pump-off, paraffin/asphaltene deposition, separator carryover,
      suction/discharge restrictions).
    - >-
      Alarm rationalization layer that suppresses nuisance alarms and escalates
      high-confidence events to the control room, mobile, and CMMS.
    - >-
      Emissions-aware anomalies (flaring spikes, tank venting, compressor seal
      leaks) with event quantification for reporting and fee avoidance.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment accelerators: prebuilt connectors (PI/AF, AVEVA,
      Ignition, Kepware), template models by lift type, and guided 8–12 week
      pilots.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect, diagnose, and act on well and facility anomalies within
    minutes—cutting false alarms by >50%, reducing MTTA/MTTR, and recovering
    barrels while lowering methane intensity—with fast integration to SCADA/PI
    and prescriptive first actions proven in field playbooks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, cross-basin library of labeled failure signatures and
    prescriptive playbooks tied to actual work orders and outcomes;
    edge-certified connectors for rapid, low-latency deployments in OT
    environments; and quantified, contract-backed impact reporting that
    accelerates operator buy-in and expansion.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production and operations leaders at E&P companies who want stable, safe
    wells and facilities with early warning and clear first actions to keep
    barrels flowing
  problem: >-
    True anomalies hide in noisy SCADA data and teams cannot watch every tag.
    Early signals are missed, alarms are ignored, and issues snowball into
    downtime, equipment damage, and HSE exposure
  guide: >-
    We understand field realities from ESP trips to separator upsets. Our AI
    monitors wells and facilities in near real time, flags abnormal behavior,
    explains likely causes, and suggests first actions. Built by production
    engineers and data scientists and integrated securely with your SCADA and
    historians
  plan: >-
    Connect data and define assets and alert routing; calibrate on recent
    history and validate with your engineers; go live with role based alerts,
    prioritized root cause hypotheses, and playbooks; iterate with weekly ops
    reviews and clear KPIs
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30 minute demo and launch a 60 day pilot on a subset of wells and
    facilities with agreed success criteria
  success: >-
    Catch problems hours sooner, prevent shut ins, shorten MTTR, reduce callouts
    and site visits, lower OPEX and emissions, improve safety and compliance,
    and sustain higher production with confidence
  failure: >-
    Without proactive surveillance, small deviations escalate into failures
    including lost barrels, equipment damage, flaring or spills, regulatory
    hits, and exhausted teams firefighting alarms
