  problem:
    - >-
      Haul trucks spend 15–30% of shift time queueing, spotting, and idling due
      to suboptimal dispatching, uneven loader performance, and road/crusher
      bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Dispatchers and supervisors lack predictive, real-time tools and rely on
      static rules or tribal knowledge, especially during shift changes, weather
      events, or breakdowns.
    - >-
      Operators receive limited, delayed feedback on approach, spotting, and
      waiting behavior that materially impacts cycle times.
    - >-
      Telematics and FMS data (Cat MineStar, Modular, Wenco, Hexagon, OEM APIs)
      are siloed; existing dashboards describe the past but rarely prescribe
      actions.
    - >-
      Idle time and micro-delays inflate cost/tonne, fuel burn, and emissions
      while deferring metal production, yet shift-level interventions are not
      measured or repeated.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from FMS/telematics to build a live digital twin of
      fleet, loaders, dumps, and haul roads; map events (spot, load start/end,
      queue-in/out) and cycle phases.
    - >-
      Predictive bottleneck detection (5–15 minute horizon) flagging emerging
      queues at loaders/dumps and road constraints; quantify impact by tonnes
      and truck-hours at risk.
    - >-
      Prescriptive shift actions delivered to dispatch/supervisors
      (radio/tablet): retask trucks between loaders, adjust dump destinations,
      stagger breaks, throttle arrivals, change shovel priorities.
    - >-
      Operator micro-coaching: approach-speed and spot-zone guidance,
      excessive-idle nudge, P95 spot-time alerts; optional cab tablet UI or
      integrate with existing in-cab displays/radios.
    - >-
      Shift report and SIC workflow: compare plan vs actual; attribute lost
      tonnes to specific causes; A/B test interventions and auto-learn
      site-specific policies.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud deployment: site gateway for low-latency and offline
      resilience; secure, auditable recommendations with site safety rules baked
      in.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase ore/waste moved per shift by 5–12% within 8 weeks—without adding
    trucks—by turning existing telematics into prescriptive, shift-level actions
    that cut queueing, spotting, and idle time. Vendor-agnostic, fast to deploy,
    measurable ROI tied to cost/tonne.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built, prescriptive SIC engine for haul/load that is
    vendor-agnostic, operates at shift cadence, and ships with a library of
    proven interventions for gold/silver pit operations. Cross-site labeled
    datasets enable cold-start accuracy; change-management playbooks drive
    sustained adoption. Integrations and safety constraints are pre-solved,
    shortening pilots to <90 days with measurable ROI.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Mine managers, dispatch supervisors, and pit foremen at gold and silver ore
    operations (NAICS 212220) who must hit shift production targets at a lower
    $/ton without adding trucks or risking safety.
  problem: >-
    External: Trucks stack at shovels/crushers, slow spotting, long queues, idle
    burn, and unbalanced dispatch; telematics is fragmented and noisy.

    Internal: Leaders feel blind and reactive—too many dashboards, not enough
    clear actions—while pressure mounts to meet ounces and budget.

    Philosophical: Time and fuel shouldn’t be wasted in queues; every haul cycle
    should respect people, equipment, and the plan.
  guide: >-
    We understand haul/load chaos and how seconds at the face cascade into lost
    tons. Fleet Productivity Coach is built by mining operations and AI experts
    for gold and silver sites. We turn raw telematics into safe, shift-level
    actions supervisors trust—no new hardware, operators remain in control.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect dispatch and telematics (read-only, no downtime).

    2) Calibrate with 2–4 weeks of cycles to baseline queue, spot, and idle.

    3) 14-day pilot on one fleet with supervisor playbooks and radio scripts.

    4) Roll out sitewide with shift briefs, mid-shift nudges, and end-of-shift
    reports.

    Agreement plan:

    - Clear KPIs: queue time, spot time, idle, tons/shift, $/ton.

    - Data security and safety-first recommendations (not automation).

    - Measured ROI before scale-up.
  callToAction: |-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot this month.
    Transitional: Request a sample shift report and ROI estimate.
  success: |-
    - 5–15% more tons per shift
    - 20–40% less queue time
    - 10–20% less idle and fuel burn
    - Balanced shovel utilization and predictable cycles
    - Safer, calmer traffic flow and fewer radio firefights
    - Supervisors confident with clear, data-backed actions every shift
  failure: |-
    - Trucks burning fuel in queues and missing spot windows
    - Overtime and missed ounce targets
    - Higher $/ton, tire/engine wear, and congestion risk
    - Frustrated crews and underutilized capital
    - Another dashboard no one acts on

  solution:
    - 'AI watches live cycles to predict queueing, spotting, and idle minutes.'
    - >-
      Issues shift-level actions: reassign trucks, stagger breaks, retime
      fueling, adjust routes.
    - Optimizes loader–truck pairing to match payload and dig rate.
    - 'Delivers short, targeted operator tips based on recent cycles.'

    - No new hardware; deploy in weeks with site IT/security approval.
  features:
    - Queue forecast at each shovel/crusher with minute-by-minute risk.
    - 'Spot time benchmarks by loader, truck, operator, and bench.'
    - Dynamic truck–shovel assignment and slotting to cut wait time.
    - Break and fueling scheduler to avoid peak queues.
    - Haul-road health from speed variance; grader dispatch suggestions.
    - 'Idle root-cause labeling: queue, spot, break, fuel, maintenance, weather.'
    - Auto-generated shift playbooks for supervisors (start-of-shift).
    - Radio/SMS/mobile delivery; resilient to poor connectivity.
    - >-
      Live KPI board: queue min/truck, spot time, idle %, cycles/hr, tph,
      fuel/ton, CO2.
    - 'Safety cues: congestion alerts at load points and dumps.'
    - Blend- and ore-stream-aware priorities (ore vs. waste).
  steps:
    - Connect OEM telematics and dispatch feeds (1–2 days).
    - Baseline one week of cycles to pinpoint top bottlenecks.
    - Pilot on one pit/loader; deliver actions to supervisors and operators.
    - 'Review weekly: quantify minutes saved and tph uplift; tune playbooks.'
    - Scale site-wide; integrate with maintenance and planning cadence.
