  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers struggle to operationalize custom computer vision for defect
      detection; off-the-shelf rules-based vision tools underperform on variable
      lighting, surface finishes, and evolving defect types.
    - >-
      High false reject rates (2–10%) create unnecessary rework and scrap;
      missed defects (false accepts) drive warranty/returns and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Data is siloed on edge PCs or inspection stations; model drift goes
      unnoticed, and model updates are irregular or non-existent.
    - >-
      Skilled ML talent is scarce on the factory floor; integration with
      MES/QMS/PLC is complex and slow, delaying ROI.
    - >-
      Quality leaders lack continuous, actionable reporting tying vision
      performance to yield, OEE, and cost savings.
    - >-
      Procurement risk: large up-front capex for vision systems with uncertain
      performance; customers want predictable opex with outcomes guarantees.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data triage and labeling workflow: secure ingestion from cameras/edge PCs;
      rapid labeling with active learning to minimize manual effort.
    - >-
      Custom model training pipeline optimized for industrial imagery (specular
      surfaces, small defects, low contrast) with class-balanced augmentation
      and synthetic data for rare defects.
    - >-
      On-edge runtime (NVIDIA Jetson/industrial PCs) with sub-1-second
      inference; cloud retraining and A/B testing prior to promotion.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and drift detection (distribution shift,
      performance-by-class, station-level KPIs) triggering retrain jobs.
    - >-
      Monthly and quarterly reports linking model performance to yield, scrap,
      and cost savings; executive-ready summaries.
    - >-
      Integration adapters for MES/QMS/SCADA/PLC; API and OPC-UA/REST connectors
      for pass/fail, class, and localization outputs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review station for uncertain cases to improve label
      quality and accelerate model learning.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: customer data isolation, on-prem/air-gapped
      options for regulated environments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    Ops and quality leaders in hardware manufacturing who need fast, reliable
    visual defect decisions at scale
  problem: >-
    Manual inspection is slow and inconsistent, off the shelf models miss edge
    cases, and model upkeep stalls which drives false rejects, escapes, scrap,
    and audit risk
  guide: >-
    We understand line speed and yield pressure. Our team has shipped production
    CV across SMT, machining, molding, assembly, and packaging with measurable
    cuts in escapes and scrap. We deliver vision triage and model training as a
    managed service
  plan: >-
    Step 1 share sample images securely on prem or in your VPC. Step 2 we
    benchmark and train on your data then validate against holdouts. Step 3
    deploy to your workflow and receive scheduled model updates and clear
    performance reports
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30 minute demo or start a fixed scope pilot. Or download a sample
    report to see accuracy, drift, and ROI projections
  success: >-
    Higher first pass yield, fewer escapes and false alarms, faster triage and
    root cause, audit ready reporting, and models that improve every cycle
    without burdening your team
  failure: >-
    Missed defects, chronic false positives, rising scrap and overtime, delayed
    shipments, and AI efforts that stall in pilots

  problem:
    - Manual inspection misses defects and slows throughput.
    - 'Generic CV models break on your lighting, materials, and variants.'
    - 'Labeling, tooling, and MLOps drain engineering time.'
    - Models drift as processes change; updates get deferred.
    - False positives trigger rework; false negatives ship defects.
    - Images are scattered; labels are inconsistent and incomplete.
    - 'Integrating models with cameras, PLCs, and edge devices is painful.'
  solution:
    - We build and tune custom defect classifiers/detectors from your images.
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑loop triage prioritizes edge cases for faster, cleaner
      labeling.
    - Scheduled model refreshes with drift detection and versioned releases.
    - 'Clear reports on accuracy, defect rates, and yield impact.'
    - Deploy via API or on‑prem edge runtimes that fit your line constraints.
    - Secure data handling with on‑prem or private cloud options.
  features:
    - >-
      Defect classification and localization (boxes/masks) tailored to your
      SKUs.
    - 'Active learning: uncertain images auto‑queued for triage.'
    - 'Labeling workflows with templates, reviewer QC, and audit trails.'
    - Data augmentation and synthetic generation for rare defects.
    - 'Optimized model variants for CPUs, edge GPUs, and vision controllers.'
    - 'Dashboards: precision/recall, FP/FN, per‑line and per‑SKU trends.'

    - 'Integrations: cameras, MES/ERP, PLC, REST/gRPC, MQTT.'
    - Monitoring and alerts for drift and anomaly spikes.
    - 'Enterprise controls: SSO, RBAC, audit logs, and SLA‑backed support.'
  steps:
    - Upload a sample set or connect your image stream.
    - Define your defect taxonomy and pass/fail thresholds.
    - 'We train a baseline model in days, not months.'
    - Validate on your hold‑out set; review error modes together.
