leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Labels, libraries, and karaoke producers lack stems for legacy catalogs,
      blocking remixes, immersive mixes, and sync-ready deliverables.
    - >-
      Producers and DJs need fast, clean instrumentals/acapellas; DIY tools
      often introduce audible artifacts, timing drift, and phase issues not
      acceptable for broadcast.
    - >-
      Batch processing at scale (10k–1M tracks) is slow and expensive without
      automation, QC, and rights workflows.
    - >-
      Rights and licensing are risky: generating and distributing stems from
      copyrighted works without clear permissions can create legal exposure.
    - >-
      Existing solutions split 2–4 stems; professional users increasingly
      require 6–8+ stems, alignment, MIDI/chords, and deliverables at 24-bit/48
      kHz with consistent loudness and phase.
    - >-
      No unified pipeline exists that combines separation, metadata enrichment,
      enterprise SLAs, and a licensing/clearance workflow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Industry-grade AI stem separation with optional human-in-the-loop QC for
      high-stakes deliverables (broadcast/sync).
    - >-
      Rights-aware pipeline: fingerprinting on upload, permissions gating,
      licensing workflows, and audit trails; BYO-content mode vs.
      rights-verified mode.
    - >-
      Scalable delivery: web app, API, and batch ingestion; 2, 4, 6, and 8+ stem
      models; auto key/BPM/chords; export to DAW sessions (Ableton/Logic/Pro
      Tools templates).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Broadcast-quality stems, karaoke instrumentals, and acapellas with
    rights-aware workflows, batch/API at scale, and measurable audio
    quality—delivered fast enough for production, clean enough for sync.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Licensed multitrack training corpus via label/library partnerships plus a
    rights-aware production pipeline (fingerprinting, permissions, and
    watermarked previews) that competitors without clearances cannot easily
    replicate. Human-in-the-loop QC for enterprise deliverables and DAW/session
    export workflows further raise switching costs.

    Catalog owners, labels, post-audio teams, and producers who need fast, clean
    stems, karaoke instrumentals, and acapellas to unlock catalog value, nail
    briefs, and power remixes and sync.
  problem: >-
    External: You’re handed full mixes when projects demand stems,
    instrumentals, or acapellas—yesterday. Internal: DIY tools introduce
    artifacts and phase issues, slowing approvals and eroding trust.
    Philosophical: Great music deserves to be as flexible and usable as the
    stories it supports.
  guide: >-
    We understand last‑minute briefs and legacy catalogs without multitracks.
    Our audio engineers pair proven AI separation with human QC to deliver
    phase‑aligned, broadcast‑ready assets trusted by professional labels, post
    houses, and creators.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload or connect your catalog via web, S3, or API. 2) Choose
    deliverables (stems by instrument, instrumental, acapella), specs (WAV/AIFF,
    sample rate/bit depth, loudness), and metadata. 3) Receive phase‑aligned
    files within hours, with optional engineer review and batch automation.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a project now. Transitional: Request a free 60‑second test
    separation or book a 10‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    Consistent, broadcast‑ready stems; faster edits and approvals; more sync
    placements; remix‑ready packs; karaoke/instrumental SKUs for new revenue;
    clean acapellas for creative versions; searchable, metadata‑rich assets
    delivered on spec and on time.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines and placements; artifact‑ridden separations; stalled
    remixes; unusable catalog backfiles; inconsistent formats; overworked teams
    and lost revenue.
