leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High manual effort to review PPAP/FAI/CoC/EHS packages (2–6 hours per
      complex package; 5–10 minutes per CoC) creates bottlenecks in NPI and
      incoming inspection.
    - >-
      Inconsistent and incomplete supplier documentation leads to delays,
      rework, and expensive line-stops or delays in FAT/SAT milestones.
    - >-
      Lack of standardization across supplier formats, languages, and scan
      quality increases error rates and training burden for SQEs and buyers.
    - >-
      Repetitive, low-value communication (clarification emails, missing-item
      lists) consumes SQE time and leads to long supplier response times.
    - >-
      Limited traceability/auditability of why a package was accepted; hard to
      prove due diligence during customer/ISO/SEMI audits.
    - >-
      High risk of “escapes” (e.g., wrong revision, missing special process
      certs, expired EHS declarations), especially under surge volume,
      increasing cost of poor quality.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (email, shared drives, PLM/eQMS/ERP) cause version
      control issues and slow approvals.
    - >-
      Confidential IP and export-controlled data constraints limit the use of
      generic cloud tools; need secure on-prem/VPC options with strict access
      controls.
  solution:
    - >-
      Document intelligence pipeline: ingest email attachments, supplier portal
      uploads, SFTP, and EDI; parse native PDFs/Office and scanned images;
      extract fields, tables, stamps, signatures, dates, lot/heat/batch IDs,
      revs, test results.
    - >-
      Configurable checklist/rule engine: encode corporate checklists (by part
      criticality, commodity, special processes), PPAP/FAI level logic,
      drawing/spec rev checks, cert validity dates, EHS thresholds;
      multi-language support.
    - >-
      Risk scoring: score each package on completeness, consistency, supplier
      history, anomaly detection (e.g., mismatched revs, expired calibration).
    - >-
      AI-generated actions: draft supplier missing-item lists, RFQs for
      corrective docs, and clarification emails; propose disposition options
      (accept, conditional accept, reject) with rationale and highlighted
      evidence.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: side-by-side comparison to drawings/specs;
      one-click approve/reject; exception workflows; bulk triage for high-volume
      CoCs.
    - >-
      Integrations and traceability: connectors to PLM (Teamcenter, Windchill,
      SAP ECTR, Arena/Agile), eQMS (ETQ, MasterControl), ERP (SAP, Oracle), and
      ticketing (Jira/ServiceNow). Push decision, redlines, and audit trail back
      to system of record.
    - >-
      Security and deployment: SOC 2-aligned program, SSO/SAML, role-based
      access, data redaction, VPC/private cloud or on-prem GPU inference; US/EU
      data residency and export-control aware data governance.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboards for cycle time, straight-through-processing (STP),
      supplier completeness rate, top failure modes, and escape trends; cohort
      analysis by supplier and commodity.
    - >-
      Change control: auto-watch for spec/drawing rev changes; trigger
      re-validation of affected docs; notify suppliers with new requirements.
    - >-
      Supplier enablement: optional supplier portal with pre-flight checks and
      templates to increase first-pass yield.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster supplier document intake for semicon equipment makers — AI that
    parses PPAP/FAI/CoC/EHS packages, checks against your checklists and specs,
    flags gaps, drafts supplier clarifications, and pushes clean, auditable
    results to PLM/eQMS — with secure on-prem/VPC deployment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset and rule library tailored to semiconductor
    equipment supplier documentation, coupled with certified PLM/eQMS connectors
    and secure VPC/on-prem inference. This domain-specific accuracy and
    integration depth create high switching costs and clear differentiation from
    generic IDP tools.

    Quality, Supplier Development, and Operations leaders at semiconductor
    machinery manufacturers NAICS 333242 who need to qualify and onboard
    suppliers fast without risking compliance or yield
  problem: >-
    Inconsistent PPAP FAI CoC EHS packages and scattered emails make manual
    checks slow and error prone, teams fear missed requirements that cause
    rework delays and audit findings, and engineers want to build machines not
    chase paperwork

    We understand supplier documentation pain from the factory floor. We built
    an AI tuned for compliance packages that maps evidence to your checklists
    and customer specs, highlights gaps with clear rationale, and drafts
    supplier clarification requests so your team can focus on decisions not
    document hunting
  plan: >-
    1 Connect your checklists and systems PLM ERP QMS and approved supplier
    list. 2 Ingest packages automatically then parse normalize check and risk
    score with explainable findings. 3 Resolve and approve by sending auto
    drafted clarifications tracking responses and exporting an audit ready trail

  success: >-
    Shorter supplier onboarding lead time, fewer escapes and nonconformances,
    clean audit readiness, higher confidence in compliance, clear risk
    visibility per part and supplier, and more engineering time for value add
    work
