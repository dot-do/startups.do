  vision: "Audit-ready AS9102 FAI and PPAP packages in hours, not days."
  mission: "Automate quality documentation with AI-powered drawing analysis and standards-aware process generation."
  purpose: "Accelerate first shipments with zero-defect quality submissions."
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Preparing AS9102 FAI and PPAP Level 3 packages is slow (12–24 engineer-hours per drawing set) and error-prone, delaying PPAP/FAI approval and first shipments."
    - "Manual ballooning and GD&T extraction lead to missed characteristics, mis-numbering, and traceability gaps that trigger findings during audits (AS9102/AS9145, IATF 16949) and customer rejects."
    - "Quality teams duplicate work across artifacts (ballooned drawings, characteristics matrix, PFMEA, Control Plan, Inspection Plan) without a single source of truth."
    - "Engineering changes require rework of entire packages; maintaining revision-to-characteristic traceability is cumbersome and risky."
    - "Small and mid-size 336999 suppliers lack resources to maintain current standards, templates, and best practices, causing variability across plants and customers."
    - "Security and regulatory constraints (ITAR/EAR, CMMC, customer portal requirements) limit use of generic cloud tools or offshore services."
  solution:
    - "AI-powered parsing of PDFs and native CAD/MBD to auto-balloon drawings; creates a characteristics list with IDs, GD&T, critical/special status, and sampling requirements."
    - "Rule engine aligned with AS9102 Rev C and AIAG/VDA for PPAP to auto-generate PFMEA and Control Plan suggestions from routing/BOM/process steps."
    - "Automated Inspection Plan creation with gage selection guidance, sampling plans (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4/Z1.9), and CMM/Metrology export (e.g., QIF, DMIS, CSV)."
    - "Change management: Rev-to-rev comparison highlights added/changed characteristics; cascades updates to PFMEA/Control Plan and preserves characteristic IDs."
    - "Integrations: bi-directional connectors to PLM (Windchill, Teamcenter, 3DEXPERIENCE), QMS (ETQ, Plex, MasterControl), ERP/MES, and measurement systems (Hexagon, ZEISS)."
    - "Security options: SaaS in US-only cloud, VPC, or on-prem/air-gapped for ITAR/EAR and CMMC Level 2 environments; audit trails and e-signatures (21 CFR Part 11-style)."
    - "Customer-specific templates and export packs (AS9102 Forms 1–3, PPAP element set, ballooned PDFs, characteristic matrix, gage R&R templates)."
  uniqueValueProp: "Generate an audit-ready AS9102 FAI or PPAP Level 3 package in hours, not days. Our AI reads 2D/3D (MBD) drawings, balloons characteristics, extracts GD&T, and auto-builds a linked PFMEA, Control Plan, Inspection Plan, and characteristic map with full traceability and secure, ITAR-ready deployment."
  unfairAdvantage: "Closed-loop learning on real PPAP/FAI outcomes and NCRs across 336999 suppliers, plus a proprietary, labeled GD&T/drawing dataset and a standards-aware rule engine that auto-links characteristics to PFMEA/Control Plan. Secure, ITAR-capable deployments and early prime partnerships create switching costs and preferred-vendor status."
  customerSegments:
    - "Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers within NAICS 336999 (All Other Transportation Equipment Manufacturing) delivering to defense, specialty vehicle, and niche transportation OEMs."
    - "Quality Directors, Manufacturing Engineering Managers, and APQP/FAI coordinators responsible for PPAP/AS9102 submissions."
    - "OEMs and primes' supplier quality teams seeking higher-quality, faster, and more consistent submissions."
    - "Contract manufacturers and machine shops in the 336999 supply chain that frequently submit FAIs for new/changed parts."
    - "Enterprise PLM/QMS owners who need digital thread and traceability from drawing to inspection results."
  channels:
    - "Direct sales to Quality/Manufacturing Engineering leaders at 336999 suppliers via targeted outbound (firmographic filters, supplier lists to primes)."
    - "Partnerships and marketplaces: PLM/QMS vendors (PTC, Siemens, Dassault, ETQ, Plex) and metrology providers (Hexagon, ZEISS)."
    - "Industry associations/events: ASQ, SAE International, AeroDef, IMTS; webinars on AS9102/AS9145 and PPAP best practices."
    - "Prime/OEM supplier portals and preferred-tools programs; co-marketing with primes to improve submission quality."
    - "Content-led growth: templates, checklists, and calculators (FAI/PPAP time/cost) driving inbound; case studies showing first-pass acceptance uplift."
    - "Pilot-led selling: 30–60 day paid pilots in one product family or cell; success criteria tied to time-to-approval and findings reduction."
  revenueStreams:
    - "SaaS subscription (annual): Starter $12k/site (includes 200 packs/yr), Professional $36k/site (includes 750 packs/yr), Enterprise $90k/site (includes 2,500 packs/yr, on-prem option)."
    - "Usage overages: $75–$150 per additional pack depending on volume and SLA."
    - "Enterprise license: multi-site/unlimited packs with per-seat viewer/editor add-ons."
    - "Professional services: integrations, template configuration, data migration, and custom PFMEA libraries ($150–$220/hr or fixed-scope)."
    - "Training and certification for internal 'FAI Champions' and system integrators."
    - "Managed PPAP/FAI service for surge demand (white-glove, priced per pack)."

    - "R&D: ML/vision engineers, manufacturing quality SMEs, and software engineers ($3.5–5M/yr at scale)."
    - "Cloud/GPU inference and storage (FedRAMP/AWS GovCloud or Azure Government options): $0.80–$2.50 per pack in variable cost depending on file size/MBD."
