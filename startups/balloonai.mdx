leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Preparing AS9102 FAI and PPAP Level 3 packages is slow (12–24
      engineer-hours per drawing set) and error-prone, delaying PPAP/FAI
      approval and first shipments.
    - >-
      Manual ballooning and GD&T extraction lead to missed characteristics,
      mis-numbering, and traceability gaps that trigger findings during audits
      (AS9102/AS9145, IATF 16949) and customer rejects.
    - >-
      Quality teams duplicate work across artifacts (ballooned drawings,
      characteristics matrix, PFMEA, Control Plan, Inspection Plan) without a
      single source of truth.
    - >-
      Engineering changes require rework of entire packages; maintaining
      revision-to-characteristic traceability is cumbersome and risky.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size 336999 suppliers lack resources to maintain current
      standards, templates, and best practices, causing variability across
      plants and customers.
    - >-
      Security and regulatory constraints (ITAR/EAR, CMMC, customer portal
      requirements) limit use of generic cloud tools or offshore services.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered parsing of PDFs and native CAD/MBD to auto-balloon drawings;
      creates a characteristics list with IDs, GD&T, critical/special status,
      and sampling requirements.
    - >-
      Rule engine aligned with AS9102 Rev C and AIAG/VDA for PPAP to
      auto-generate PFMEA and Control Plan suggestions from routing/BOM/process
      steps.
    - >-
      Automated Inspection Plan creation with gage selection guidance, sampling
      plans (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4/Z1.9), and CMM/Metrology export (e.g., QIF, DMIS,
      CSV).
    - >-
      Change management: Rev-to-rev comparison highlights added/changed
      characteristics; cascades updates to PFMEA/Control Plan and preserves
      characteristic IDs.
    - >-
      Integrations: bi-directional connectors to PLM (Windchill, Teamcenter,
      3DEXPERIENCE), QMS (ETQ, Plex, MasterControl), ERP/MES, and measurement
      systems (Hexagon, ZEISS).
    - >-
      Security options: SaaS in US-only cloud, VPC, or on-prem/air-gapped for
      ITAR/EAR and CMMC Level 2 environments; audit trails and e-signatures (21
      CFR Part 11-style).
    - >-
      Customer-specific templates and export packs (AS9102 Forms 1–3, PPAP
      element set, ballooned PDFs, characteristic matrix, gage R&R templates).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate an audit-ready AS9102 FAI or PPAP Level 3 package in hours, not
    days. Our AI reads 2D/3D (MBD) drawings, balloons characteristics, extracts
    GD&T, and auto-builds a linked PFMEA, Control Plan, Inspection Plan, and
    characteristic map with full traceability and secure, ITAR-ready deployment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on real PPAP/FAI outcomes and NCRs across 336999
    suppliers, plus a proprietary, labeled GD&T/drawing dataset and a
    standards-aware rule engine that auto-links characteristics to PFMEA/Control
    Plan. Secure, ITAR-capable deployments and early prime partnerships create
    switching costs and preferred-vendor status.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

  character: >-
    Quality, manufacturing, and engineering leaders in NAICS 336999 who must
    deliver compliant AS9102 FAI or AIAG PPAP packages—on time, on spec, every
    build.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual ballooning and doc creation across drawings, spreadsheets,
    and revisions takes days and invites errors, delays, and audit findings.
    Internal: Teams feel stretched, worried about missed characteristics,
    traceability gaps, and late submissions. Philosophical: Engineers should
    focus on making reliable parts, not wrestling paperwork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the scramble of last‑minute PPAP/FAI, chasing balloons
    and characteristic IDs across revs. Authority: Built by veteran quality
    engineers; aligns with AS9102 and AIAG PPAP; proven on production parts;
    secure with role‑based access and audit trails.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload drawing/CAD and BOM. 2) Select AS9102 FAI or PPAP. 3) AI
    auto‑balloons drawings and extracts characteristics. 4) Auto‑generate
    control plan, PFMEA, inspection plan, and characteristic map. 5) Review,
    edit, assign methods/tolerances. 6) Export a complete, signable package.
    Agreement: Run a short pilot, confirm data handling/SLA, then scale across
    programs.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a pilot on a live part. Transitional:
    Download a sample FAI/PPAP pack and a PPAP/AS9102 readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Dramatically shorter prep cycles (often days to hours), consistent
    ballooning and traceability, fewer findings and chargebacks, faster
    launches, confident audits, standardized artifacts across programs, happier
    customers, and more awarded work.
  failure: >-
    Missed launches, rework, nonconformances, audit findings, chargebacks,
    scrap, strained customer relationships, burned‑out teams, and lost bids to
    faster competitors.
