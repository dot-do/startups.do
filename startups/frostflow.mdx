leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Airports and deicing service providers lose departure slots (TSAT/CTOT)
      because pushbacks are triggered without accurate visibility of deicing pad
      queues and service times.
    - >-
      Unpredictable queue lengths and pad throughput cause avoidable taxi-out
      times and engine-on waiting, increasing fuel burn and CO2, and risking
      holdover-time expirations.
    - >-
      Airline OCCs, ramp control, and deicing coordinators rely on radio calls
      and static spreadsheets; they lack a shared, data-driven forecast to
      coordinate pad assignment and push sequence decisions.
    - >-
      Weather regime shifts (e.g., snow to freezing rain) change spray time and
      throughput, but current systems don’t update queue predictions quickly
      enough to prevent missed slots.
    - >-
      Operational stakeholders (airport ops, ramp, ATC deicing coordinator,
      airlines) make local optimizations that hurt system-wide throughput due to
      limited collaboration tools.
    - >-
      During peak winter operations, 5–15% of departures at cold-weather hubs
      experience deicing-related departure delays of 10–25 minutes that could be
      mitigated with better forecasting and sequence advice.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predictive deicing pad queue lengths, wait times, and throughput by
      pad/aircraft type over 15-min increments for the next 2–6 hours.
    - >-
      Decision support: recommended pad assignment and push sequence to maximize
      TSAT/CTOT compliance and minimize taxi/engine-on time while respecting
      holdover and operational constraints.
    - >-
      “Slot-saver” alerts that signal the latest safe push time by flight to hit
      TSAT/EDCT/CTOT given current queues and deicing durations.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planner to test weather shifts, pad closures, truck
      reallocations, or airline prioritization rules.
    - >-
      Seamless integration via APIs with A-CDM, AODB, deicing management
      systems, TFMS/SWIM feeds, and airline OCC tools.
    - >-
      Operator consoles for AOCC, ramp control, and deicing supervisors;
      lightweight mobile/tablet view for pad chiefs and gate coordinators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Protect departure slots and reduce winter delays with AI that forecasts
    deicing pad queues 2–6 hours ahead and advises pad assignments and push
    sequences to meet TSAT/CTOT—integrated into A-CDM/surface ops workflows with
    explainable, real-time updates.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Airport-calibrated, holdover-aware forecasting models trained on
    multi-airport deicing datasets and integrated directly with TSAT/CTOT
    workflows via A-CDM partners—combined with explainable recommendations,
