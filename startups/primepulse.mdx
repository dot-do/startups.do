  problem:
    - >-
      Low repeat frequency: independent meat retailers struggle to bring
      customers back weekly without manual outreach; most rely on irregular
      Facebook posts or in-store signage.
    - >-
      Inventory volatility: perishable cuts, limited holiday packs, and seasonal
      items require timely sell-through, but stores lack real-time customer
      alerting.
    - >-
      Generic marketing tools: horizontal SMS/email platforms lack SKU-level
      segmentation, butcher-specific templates, and POS match-back, resulting in
      poor relevance and attribution.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: customer data sits across POS, loyalty, and web
      ordering with no unified segmentation or ROI view.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: inconsistent opt-in/opt-out capture and TCPA/CASL/GDPR
      compliance exposes small retailers to legal risk.
    - >-
      Resource constraints: owners/managers have limited time—manual campaign
      building and copywriting are barriers to consistent weekly outreach.
    - >-
      Inadequate measurement: retailers cannot attribute offer redemptions or
      incremental revenue to specific messages, undermining budget confidence.
    - >-
      Limited list growth: shops lack in-store capture systems and incentives to
      scale their SMS/email subscriber bases.
  solution:
    - >-
      Butcher-specific AI segmentation: auto-build cohorts (Steak Lovers,
      BBQ/Smokers, Bulk Freezer Buyers, Value Seekers, Holiday Entertainers)
      from POS/loyalty/web data.
    - >-
      Automated campaign engine: schedules weekly specials, weather/seasonal
      promotions (grilling, tailgates), and real-time back-in-stock alerts tied
      to SKU inventory thresholds.
    - >-
      Closed-loop ROI tracking: unique barcodes/coupons per campaign, POS
      match-back, and incremental lift analysis vs. control cohorts.
    - >-
      List growth toolkit: in-store QR codes, digital receipts, Wi-Fi captive
      portal, tablet sign-up, and incentives—all TCPA/CASL/GDPR compliant.
    - >-
      Compliance and deliverability: 10DLC registration, consent capture logs,
      quiet hours, frequency caps, and automated opt-out handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Drive repeat visits and faster sell-through with an AI agent built for meat
    retailers: auto-segment customers by cut, spend, and season; trigger weekly
    specials, holiday packs, and back-in-stock alerts; and prove ROI with POS
    match-back—all compliant and ready in under 7 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Butcher-first data model (SKU-to-cut taxonomy + price sensitivity signals),
    prebuilt holiday/grilling templates proven in vertical pilots, and POS
    match-back that attributes revenue at the cut/SKU level—delivering
    immediate, trusted ROI that generic SMS/email tools cannot match.
