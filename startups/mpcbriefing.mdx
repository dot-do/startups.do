leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Briefing pack creation is manual and slow: 2–6 staff-weeks per MPC cycle
      across Economics, Markets, and Statistics departments
    - >-
      Last-minute data/model updates cause version drift and inconsistencies
      across charts, tables, and narrative
    - >-
      Limited auditability and traceability of figures to underlying models/data
      sources, complicating scrutiny and FOI requests
    - >-
      Knowledge silos: key analysts become bottlenecks; institutional memory is
      lost when staff rotate
    - >-
      Compliance and security constraints (air-gapped, classified content) block
      use of general AI tools
    - >-
      Repetitive formatting and templating errors slip into Board-facing
      materials; high reputational risk
    - >-
      Q&A prep for policymakers is incomplete or outdated relative to latest
      data and model runs
    - >-
      Translation/localization for bilingual authorities adds 1–2 days and risks
      inconsistencies
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated assembly pipeline connecting to internal models
      (MATLAB/EViews/R/Python) and document repositories to generate
      synchronized charts, tables, and narrative
    - >-
      Retrieval-augmented generation with hard citations to datasets, model
      runs, and documents to ensure traceability
    - >-
      Scheduled refresh and late-breaking update mode that regenerates the
      entire pack consistently within minutes
    - >-
      Policy Q&A generator seeded by latest data, models, and past MPC
      minutes/speeches; red-team challenge prompts
    - >-
      Scenario and sensitivity orchestration to run pre-defined model shocks and
      insert results into the pack
    - >-
      Governance and audit layer: versioning, approvals, content classification,
      and access controls
    - >-
      On-premise or sovereign cloud deployment with zero external data egress
      and model sandboxing
    - Multilingual output with glossary management for central-bank terminology
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Meeting-ready MPC packs assembled in minutes, not weeks—charts, tables,
    narrative, and Q&A grounded in your internal models/documents with full
    audit trails, on-prem security, and policy-grade reliability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Policy-grade auditability (data lineage and citation engine) and proven
    on-prem deployments with government certifications, combined with
    central-bank–specific templates and connectors that general AI vendors lack.
    Early reference banks and cleared delivery team shorten procurement and
    reduce perceived risk.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Central bank policy teams (MPC secretariats, research directors,
    macroeconomists, comms) who must deliver authoritative, error-free briefing
    packs under tight scrutiny and tighter deadlines.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented sources, last-minute changes, and compliance
    constraints make assembling packs slow and risky. Internal: Analysts burn
    weekends reconciling versions and defending numbers. Philosophical:
    Policymakers deserve timely, transparent evidence they can trust.
  guide: >-
    We understand the rigor, confidentiality, and auditability your process
    demands. Built by former central bank economists and data engineers;
    deployable on-prem/air-gapped; full provenance, RBAC, and audit logs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect securely to approved models and document stores; set governance
    and templates. 2) Auto-generate a pilot pack (charts, tables, narrative,
    Q&A) with citations; iterate sign-off. 3) Schedule production runs and
    approvals; integrate with DMS and MDM for steady-state.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a security and requirements scoping session. Secondary:
    Request a redacted sample pack and two-week pilot.
  success: >-
    Meeting-ready packs in minutes, not days. Consistent narratives aligned to
    your models. Traceable citations and version control for every figure. Fewer
    fire drills; more time for policy judgment. Confidence before the MPC and
    credibility after the press conference.
  failure: >-
    Late-night scramble, conflicting versions, spreadsheet errors, and gaps in
    Q&A. Untraceable figures under parliamentary or FOI scrutiny. Reputational
    risk and avoidable policy mistakes.
