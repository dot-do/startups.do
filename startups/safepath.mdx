leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High and variable call/chat volumes lead to long wait times (15–45+
      minutes) and missed reports after hours.
    - >-
      Inconsistent risk triage across staff and shifts; high-risk cases can be
      under-identified or delayed.
    - >-
      Complex consent and release workflows (HIPAA/FERPA/COPPA/State laws) cause
      errors and rework; consent capture rates often <60%.
    - >-
      Documentation burden (10–20 minutes per intake) reduces frontline
      availability and data quality.
    - >-
      Language and accessibility gaps limit equitable access for non-English
      speakers and people with disabilities.
    - >-
      Fragmented routing and follow-up scheduling cause leakage; 20–40% of
      referrals fail to connect to services within 7 days.
    - >-
      Workforce shortages and turnover make 24/7 coverage and training
      difficult.
    - >-
      Audit/compliance risk due to incomplete logs, unstructured notes, and
      inconsistent application of protocols.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi‑channel (web, chat, phone) trauma‑informed agent that uses scripted
      + adaptive dialogue to build rapport, validate feelings, and collect
      required data.
    - >-
      Embedded, validated risk screenings (e.g., C‑SSRS for suicide risk, CRAFFT
      for substance screening, brief IPV/abuse indicators) with configurable
      state/county protocols.
    - >-
      Automated consent capture with e‑signature, guardian verification, and
      jurisdiction-specific forms; dynamic consent explanations at 6th–8th grade
      reading level.
    - >-
      Real‑time urgency routing (warm transfer to live staff for imminent risk;
      auto‑page on-call supervisors) with SLAs configurable by agency.
    - >-
      Integrated scheduling for follow‑ups (SMS/email reminders, calendar
      invites, telehealth links) and closed‑loop referral tracking.
    - >-
      Interoperability with CCWIS/case management (APIs, HL7/FHIR where
      applicable) to auto‑create cases, attach transcripts, and code
      dispositions.
    - >-
      Multilingual (initially English/Spanish, extendable to >20 languages) and
      accessibility features (TTY/TDD, screen-reader friendly, WCAG 2.2 AA).
    - >-
      Comprehensive audit trails: consent artifacts, timestamps, model
      prompts/outputs, escalation decisions, and redaction of PHI/PII as
      configured.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop controls: instant transfer to staff, supervisor review
      queues, and model override logging.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance layer: policy guardrails, profanity/abuse handling,
      geo-aware mandated reporting, and continuous bias monitoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 trauma‑informed AI intake that accurately identifies risk, captures
    compliant consents, routes urgency, and books follow‑ups—cutting
    time‑to‑contact by 40%+, increasing consent capture to 90%+, and improving
    high‑risk identification sensitivity to ≥95% with full auditability and
    human‑in‑the‑loop controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A safety-first, trauma‑informed model stack validated with real agency data
    under IRB oversight, combined with consent/orchestration IP and integrations
    into major CCWIS/case‑management systems; reinforced by early
    StateRAMP/FedRAMP pathways and exclusive co‑development MOUs with two large
    state agencies creating high switching costs and defensible data network
    effects.
