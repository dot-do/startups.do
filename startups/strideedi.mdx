leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual EDI order processing (850→855→856→810) causes delays, errors, and
      chargebacks; teams re-key data between EDI portals, ERP, and WMS.
    - >-
      Retailer-specific routing guides and compliance rules (labels,
      cartonization, pack slip content, ship windows, DC appointments) are
      complex and change frequently, driving costly non-compliance.
    - >-
      Inventory allocation across channels is ad hoc, leading to poor fill
      rate/backorders or overselling.
    - >-
      Poor exception handling (price mismatches, invalid SKUs/UPCs, pack size
      errors, ship window conflicts) increases deductions and slows cash
      collection.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack (ERP, WMS/3PL, EDI VAN, retailer portals) lacks
      orchestration; no single source of truth for status or SLA compliance.
    - >-
      Peaks (back-to-school/holiday) overwhelm teams; onboarding a new retailer
      can take 4–12 weeks with high mapping/testing burden.
    - >-
      Current solutions (VANs, EDI mapping tools, basic RPA) move documents but
      don’t autonomously decide, allocate, or resolve exceptions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on EDI agent that ingests 850s, validates against item master/price
      lists/inventory, and issues compliant 855s (accept/backorder/cancel) with
      reasoning and audit trails.
    - >-
      Allocation engine applies configurable business rules (channel priority,
      margin/SKU velocity, retailer penalties, min/max packs) and reserves
      inventory in ERP/WMS/3PL.
    - >-
      Pick/pack prep: generates compliant cartonization, UCC-128/GS1-128 labels,
      pack slips, BOL/VICS BOL, and pushes pick waves to WMS/3PL.
    - >-
      Automated 856 ASN creation (per retailer spec) with SSCC-18s, hierarchical
      levels (shipment, order, pack, item), and ship window safeguards.
    - >-
      Automated 810 invoicing with tax/terms/freight logic; 997 handling;
      864/870 status if applicable; auto-reconciliation against PO and ship data
      to reduce invoice disputes.
    - >-
      Exception handler: detects price/SKU/UPC mismatches, item substitutions,
      split shipments, cancel-after-date conflicts, over/short/duplicate events;
      proposes resolution and executes per policy.
    - >-
      Retailer routing guide brain: continuously updated rulebook for major
      footwear retailers/marketplaces; pre-shipment compliance checks to prevent
      chargebacks.
    - >-
      Observability: real-time order-to-cash cockpit (touchless rate, fill rate,
      SLA timers, chargeback risk alerts), with drill-down to document segments
      and labels.
    - >-
      Onboarding accelerator: prebuilt maps/test packs for common retailers;
      simulation sandbox; dual-run shadow mode; outcomes-based go-live criteria.
    - >-
      Security & compliance: SOC 2 roadmap, PII minimization, role-based
      approvals; detailed logs for audit and retailer disputes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Autonomous, retailer-compliant EDI agent that turns 850s into cash with
    minimal human touch—validating, allocating, prepping pick/pack, creating
    UCC-128/ASN, and invoicing—while proactively preventing chargebacks and
    accelerating cash collection.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, retailer-specific compliance brain paired with an
    autonomous exception-resolution engine, trained on domain-specific
    EDI/chargeback data and integrated deeply with footwear workflows
    (cartonization, UCC-128, VICS BOL). Dual-run safety and prebuilt
    maps/testing packs enable fast, low-risk onboarding that general EDI tools
    and RPA can’t match.

    Operations and sales leaders at Footwear Merchant Wholesalers (NAICS 424340)
    who must ship on time, stay retailer‑compliant, and get paid fast—without
    drowning in EDI busywork and chargebacks.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented retailer EDI (850/855/856/810), strict routing guides,
    labels, and appointments; manual keying across ERP/WMS/3PL causes errors and
    delays. Internal: Anxiety about chargebacks, missed windows, and cash stuck
    in disputes; growth stalls because adding retailers increases complexity.
    Philosophical: Your team should focus on product and customers—not babysit
    portals and PDFs.

    variants, seasonality, and DC vs. drop‑ship rules. Our AI EDI Order‑to‑Cash
    Agent brings prebuilt maps, retailer compliance guardrails, and deep EDI
    expertise, integrating with your ERP/WMS/3PL to automate the flow end‑to‑end
    with human‑in‑the‑loop oversight when needed.

    Retailer‑compliant 855/856/810 sent on time; invoices issued same day.
    Dramatically fewer manual touches and errors. Chargebacks reduced with
    proactive validation and guardrails. Faster cash and improved
    OTIF/scorecards. Clear visibility via exception queues and audit trails.
    Scale new retailers and channels without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Manual keying and swivel‑chair ops persist. Missed ship windows, invalid

    relationships strain, and growth is capped by operational bottlenecks.
