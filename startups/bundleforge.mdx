  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers under-monetize complementary products; manual bundle creation is
      time-consuming (20–40 minutes per bundle) and inconsistent across
      channels.
    - >-
      Difficulty identifying profitable, in-demand starter kits/expansions/gift
      sets from transaction data and item attributes.
    - >-
      Static bundles go out of stock or violate MAP, leading to canceled orders,
      margin erosion, and compliance issues.
    - >-
      Limited in-house analytics and copywriting capacity to produce compelling
      names, images, and listings at scale.
    - >-
      Missed seasonal opportunities (Q4, movie/brand launches, convention
      spikes) due to slow merchandising cycles.
    - >-
      Existing POS/ERP “composite items” are static; they don’t auto-generate
      bundles or optimize by demand, margin, and inventory constraints.
    - >-
      Inconsistent PIM data (attributes, age grading, safety tags,
      compatibility) makes kit discovery and merchandising error-prone.
    - >-
      Lack of clear measurement on bundle impact (AOV, margin lift, attach rate,
      sell-through).
  solution:
    - >-
      Data mining of baskets and attributes to detect high-affinity combinations
      (starter kits, expansions, gift sets).
    - >-
      AI-assisted naming, descriptions, and hero images compliant with
      brand/MAP/age/safety standards.
    - >-
      Dynamic, inventory-aware bundles that self-adjust components and pricing
      based on availability and rules.
    - >-
      Elasticity- and margin-aware pricing engine with A/B/multi-armed bandit
      tests to maximize contribution profit.
    - >-
      One-click publish to Shopify/BigCommerce/Woo (with POS sync) and
      marketplace-ready variants (Amazon/eBay where applicable).
    - >-
      Analytics: bundle attach rate, AOV and gross margin delta, contribution
      profit, sell-through, and time saved.
    - >-
      Rule-based merchandising (e.g., exclude low-margin SKUs, respect MAP, age
      3+ only, only same-brand, or cross-brand).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Auto-generate profitable, inventory-aware bundles and kits—complete with
    optimized names, pricing, images, and listings—so toy, hobby, and game
    retailers grow AOV and margin without adding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific attribute graph and pre-trained models for hobby/toy/game
    compatibility (e.g., TCG formats, Warhammer factions, LEGO themes), combined
    with privacy-preserving cross-merchant bundle performance priors. This
    enables high-precision, compliant bundles, faster than generic
    recommenders—plus partnerships with key distributors/associations for
    enriched data and distribution.
