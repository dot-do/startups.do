  problem:
    - >-
      Surface defects (pits, scratches, laps, oxidation, seams) are often
      detected late or at outgoing QC, causing rework, scrap, or customer
      claims.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis (RCA) is slow and manual; correlating defects with
      upstream parameters (roll gap, tension, coolant/emulsion, speed,
      furnace/anneal temperatures, die wear, lube) requires siloed data access
      and expert time.
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection is inconsistent, fatiguing, and misses
      small/early-stage defects at line speeds >600 m/min.
    - >-
      False alarms from legacy vision systems cause unnecessary stops and
      operator distrust.
    - >-
      Scrap and downgrades (0.5–3.0% typical) materially impact yield and
      throughput in copper rod/strip/wire lines.
    - >-
      Customer returns/PPM and audit traceability requirements are tightening
      (automotive, electrical, electronics).
    - >-
      Limited skilled workforce to continuously tune models/thresholds across
      multiple alloys (ETP, OF, low-oxygen) and formats (rod, strip, wire).
    - >-
      Existing systems rarely close the loop by suggesting process adjustments
      or feeding MES/QMS for continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge vision models for pits, scratches, laps, oxidation tailored to copper
      rod, strip, and wire, running on industrial GPUs with <200 ms detection
      latency.
    - >-
      Correlation engine that time-aligns defects with upstream parameters (OPC
      UA/MQTT/PLC tags, historian data) and computes likely root causes using
      feature attribution and pattern mining.
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance: prioritized checklists and parameter nudges (e.g.,
      roll gap ±μm, emulsion concentration %, tension setpoints, anneal furnace
      zone temps) with operator workflow.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration options to send setpoint suggestions to PLC/MES
      with human-in-the-loop approvals.
    - >-
      Dashboards: line view (real-time defect maps), shift/lot analytics, Pareto
      of defect modes by product/recipe, OEE and scrap trend overlays.
    - >-
      MLOps for continuous learning: auto-label assist, alloy/recipe-specific
      model versions, drift monitoring, A/B thresholding, and rollback.
    - >-
      Connectivity: certified connectors for OSIsoft PI/AVEVA, Ignition,
      Kepware, Siemens/Rockwell PLCs; API for QMS (8D reports) and ERP lot
      genealogy.
    - >-
      Harsh-environment ready: IP65+ enclosures, line-scan/area cameras, strobe
      lighting, vibration/heat tolerance, safety interlocks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Copper-specific AI vision and root-cause analytics that detect surface
    defects in real time and correlate them to upstream process parameters,
    cutting scrap 0.5–1.5%, reducing MTTR 30–60%, and lowering customer PPM by
    20–40%—with proven integration to PLC/MES/historians and operator-trusted,
    low-false-alarm performance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset tying defect imagery to time-synced upstream
    parameters across copper processes, plus OEM/SI partnerships that enable
    pre-validated installs and closed-loop suggestions that competitors struggle
    to match. Operator-trusted performance (low false alarms) and recipe-aware
    models further raise switching costs.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Integrated copper producers (rod casting/rolling lines; CCR) and alloy
      makers

  character: >-
    Ops and quality leaders at copper rolling, drawing, extruding, and alloying
    mills (NAICS 331420) who must deliver defect-free rod, strip, and wire while
    reducing scrap and downtime.
  problem: >-
    Surface defects—pits, scratches, laps, oxidation—escape manual inspection
    and are found late, driving rework, claims, and wasted copper. Teams lack
    fast root-cause links to process parameters, so fixes are slow and
    uncertain.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of surface defects and frantic stoppages. As
    metallurgical AI and machine-vision specialists built for copper lines, we
    integrate with cameras, PLCs, and historians to deliver reliable detection
    and explainable correlations.
  plan: >-
    1) Line assessment and connect cameras/PLC/historian. 2) Deploy edge vision
    models for real-time detection of pits, scratches, laps, oxidation. 3)
    Correlate events to upstream parameters (speed, reduction schedule,
    furnace/atmosphere, lubrication, die/roll condition, tension) with alerts
    and corrective guidance.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a pilot or line audit; request a sample defect-correlation report and
    ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Real-time visibility and root-cause clarity cut scrap and rework, boost OEE
    and yield, protect customer quality, and free teams to improve instead of
    firefight.
  failure: >-
    Without this, hidden defects appear late, rework and downtime grow, customer
    returns and claims rise, and margins erode.

  problem:
    - 'Defects found late cause scrap, rework, and customer claims.'
    - Manual inspection misses intermittent flaws and fatigues operators.
    - No fast link from surface events to upstream settings or material lots.

    - 'Deployment: on-prem, air-gapped; SSO and role-based access.'
