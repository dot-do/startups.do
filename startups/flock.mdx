  problem:
    - >-
      Respiratory and welfare issues (e.g., IBV/ILT, ammonia burns, heat stress)
      often go unnoticed for 24–72 hours, leading to elevated mortality, poorer
      FCR, and condemnations at processing.
    - >-
      Human checks are periodic (2–4 walkthroughs/day) and subjective; issues
      can arise between checks or at night when ventilation failures or
      water-line issues occur.
    - >-
      Existing barn controllers alarm on thresholds (temp, humidity) but don’t
      detect behavioral or audio signs such as coughing, distress calls, piling,
      or uneven distribution.
    - >-
      Growers and complex managers lack an objective, comparable “flock health
      score” across barns to prioritize limited service visits.
    - >-
      False alarms and data overload from IoT systems reduce trust; growers need
      actionable, low-noise alerts with clear next steps.
    - >-
      Bandwidth and rural connectivity limit real-time video analytics;
      solutions must work at the edge with minimal data costs.
    - >-
      Biosecurity and labor constraints make frequent expert visits difficult;
      earlier remote triage could reduce unnecessary call-outs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge AI device ingests barn audio, low-light video, and controller data
      (temperature, humidity, CO2, ammonia if available, static pressure, water
      flow, feeder run-time) and computes a Daily Health Score.
    - >-
      Real-time detection of cough/sneeze patterns, distress calls,
      piling/uneven distribution, inactivity spikes, and abnormal water/feeding
      signatures with explainable alerts.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts with triage checklists (2–5 minute steps a grower can
      take) and escalation to service techs if unresolved.
    - >-
      Multi-barn dashboard for integrators with heatmaps, trendlines, and
      route-prioritization for service/vet teams.
    - >-
      Hardware-light deployment: 2–4 rugged microphones, 2–4 wide-FOV IP
      cameras, edge module with on-device inference; minimal cloud video
      streaming to save bandwidth.
    - >-
      Offline-first design: continues operating during internet outages; syncs
      summaries when connected; optional LTE fallback.
    - >-
      Integrations with major barn controllers (e.g.,
      Rotem/Chore-Tronics/Hotraco) for parameter ingest and alarm correlation.
    - >-
      Weekly automated report quantifying estimated savings from avoided events,
      mortality trend, FCR risk, and processing condemnation risk markers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7, low-noise early warnings that fuse audio, video, and environmental
    data to catch respiratory and welfare issues 24–48 hours sooner than manual
    checks—reducing mortality and condemnations, improving FCR and uniformity,
    and enabling targeted service visits with clear, actionable guidance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Multimodal, edge-first dataset and models purpose-built for broiler barns,
    validated with integrator and university pilots, integrated into existing
    controller ecosystems, and proven ROI with outcomes-linked contracts—hard
    for generalist IoT or single-sensor solutions to replicate.

    - Welfare deviations drive condemnations and penalties.
    - Heat stress and ventilation failures escalate within hours.
  solution:
