  problem:
    - >-
      Front-desk staff spend 5–12 minutes per patient on manual insurance
      eligibility checks via payer portals or phone calls, causing bottlenecks
      and overtime.
    - >-
      Eligibility-related claim denials (coordination of benefits, inactive
      coverage, unmet deductible, visit limits) account for 8–15% of denials in
      many chiropractic practices.
    - >-
      Patients are surprised by bills because allowed amounts, deductibles, and
      visit limits are unclear prior to care, hurting trust and satisfaction.
    - >-
      Small clinics lack payer-specific rules for chiropractic codes
      (98940–98942, 97110, 97140, 97012, etc.), leading to inaccurate estimates
      and compliance risks (e.g., Medicare only covering spinal manipulation).
    - >-
      No-show and late-cancel rates increase when patients are uncertain about
      out-of-pocket costs (5–10% avoidable).
    - >-
      Existing RTE (real-time eligibility) tools surface raw 271 data but do not
      translate it into patient-friendly estimates, prepayment options, or
      automated reminders.
    - >-
      Estimating allowed amounts is hard without a unified fee schedule and
      payer contract repository; most practices don’t maintain this, leading to
      under- or over-collection.
    - >-
      Front-desk turnover and training challenges make consistent eligibility
      workflows difficult across staff and locations.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven bot pulls and normalizes eligibility via 270/271 (and payer
      APIs/portals when required), tailored to chiropractic benefits (CMT,
      modalities, therapy visit limits).
    - >-
      Estimate engine maps benefits, deductibles, copays/coinsurance, visit
      limits, and medical necessity rules to the clinic’s fees and
      contracted/allowed amounts to produce a patient-specific estimate.
    - >-
      Automated patient communication: sends secure SMS/email 24–48 hours
      pre-visit with estimate, benefits breakdown, and one-tap prepayment or
      card-on-file option.
    - >-
      Medicare-aware logic: flags that only spinal manipulation is covered under
      Medicare Part B; prompts ABN workflows for non-covered services (e.g.,
      exams, x-rays, therapies).
    - >-
      Pre-authorization checks and alerts for therapy codes when payer/plan
      requires it; tracks used vs. remaining visits.
    - >-
      Front-desk dashboard: exceptions queue for ambiguous benefits, estimate
      confidence score, and audit trail; integrates with EHR/PMS schedule and
      notes.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: adjusts allowed-amount assumptions using
      de-identified historical claims and patient responsibility outcomes to
      improve estimate accuracy over time.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: HIPAA-eligible infrastructure, BAAs, encryption,
      access logging, and role-based permissions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, chiropractic-specific eligibility and out-of-pocket estimates
    that text patients clear costs 24–48 hours before visits—reducing denials,
    boosting upfront collections, and saving 40–60 staff hours per month per
    location.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Chiropractic-specific benefits and estimation engine (codes, visit limits,
