  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden process drift causes out-of-spec density, compression, and
      dimensional stability in EPS/XPS lines, detected only after
      molding/extrusion and lab QA, leading to 2–8% rework/scrap and expedited
      re-runs.
    - >-
      Manual SPC and periodic lab checks miss multivariate interactions (raw
      bead lot variation, moisture, steam pressure, mold/die temperature,
      ambient humidity, line speed, aging time), creating delayed response and
      customer complaints.
    - >-
      Uniform sampling plans waste QA resources in stable conditions and
      under-sample during high-risk periods, increasing producer/consumer risk
      and COQ (Cost of Quality).
    - >-
      Equipment and sensor drift (pressure, temperature, load cell, die gap) is
      not detected early; small drift accumulates into spec violations hours
      later.
    - >-
      Data silos across PLC/SCADA, MES, and LIMS hinder timely, root-cause
      analysis and corrective action; insights are not operationalized to
      operators.
    - >-
      Regulatory/standard compliance (e.g., ASTM C578, EN 13163) requires
      documented control; current practices are audit-heavy and reactive.
    - >-
      Energy and raw material costs rise due to reprocessing, over-spec
      production (excess density “just in case”), and unstable
      startup/grade-change windows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time multivariate risk scoring for density, compression strength, and
      dimensional stability at the lot/run level with 1–6 hour lead time.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models combining bead expansion kinetics, moisture
      diffusion, steam/temperature profiles, and extruder dynamics with
      historical LIMS and SPC data.
    - >-
      Dynamic, risk-based sampling plans (e.g., ANSI/ASQ Z1.4-inspired) that
      raise/lower inspection frequency by risk band to maintain
      producer/consumer risk targets.
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance to operators: recommended setpoint ranges for steam
      pressure/flow, pre-expansion/aging time, mold cycle, die temperature, line
      speed, and bead blend ratios.
    - >-
      Early drift detection: sensor/equipment health signals (e.g., steam valve
      hysteresis, die gap drift) to prompt maintenance before quality impact.
    - >-
      Root-cause and what-if: contribution analysis across material lot,
      environment, operators, and equipment; simulation of expected quality
      outcome before implementing changes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop option: OPC UA/MQTT/REST integration to push setpoint
      adjustments into DCS/PLC under guardrails; change management and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Compliance pack: auto-generated control charts, capability indices
      (Cp/Cpk/Ppk), sampling traceability, and audit-ready reports aligned to
      ASTM/EN standards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict off-spec risk before it happens—then prescribe the next best action.
    EWQP fuses process, material, and ambient data to forecast
    density/compression/dimensional stability compliance hours ahead of QA,
    dynamically adjusts sampling plans, and recommends setpoint tweaks to cut
    scrap 20–40%, reduce QA load 25–50%, and protect OTIF and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific, physics-informed models and feature libraries for EPS/XPS
    combined with proprietary, cross-plant labeled datasets from pilots;
    pre-built industrial connectors and risk-based sampling engine tuned to
    ASTM/EN requirements deliver faster, more accurate predictions and shorter
    time-to-value than generic analytics or in-house efforts.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality/Process leader at an EPS/XPS foam plant who wants every order
    in-spec with less scrap, rework, and QA firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Variation in resin, bead moisture/blowing agent, and thermal
    profiles drives density, compression, and dimensional stability out of spec
    before molding/extrusion. Internal: Teams only see issues after the fact,
    over-sample to compensate, slow throughput, and still get surprises.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t discover defects after making them—quality
    should be predictable and proactive.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam operations and the pain of late QA holds. Our team has
    deployed production-grade AI in plastics manufacturing, aligning with ASTM
    methods and plant IT/OT security to make quality visible before it’s at
    risk.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect SCADA/PLC historians, ERP/batch, and lab results. 2)
    Train/validate early-warning models on your historical runs. 3) Go live with
    real-time risk scores, prescriptive setpoint guidance, and dynamically
    optimized sampling plans. 4) Monitor performance, retrain as needed, and
    govern with clear escalation rules.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute plant assessment to scope a 60-day pilot.
    Transitional: Request a sample risk report using your last 30 days of run
    data.
  success: >-
    Operators get hours of advance notice; QA tests where it matters; sampling
    load drops without increasing risk; Cp/Cpk improves; scrap, rework, and
    claims fall; OEE and throughput rise; audits are smoother; customers trust
    every shipment.
  failure: >-
    Without early warning, you keep firefighting: late QA holds, over-sampling
    and slowdowns, purge/rework cycles, wasted resin and energy, missed
    shipments, customer complaints, and margin erosion.

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - 'Quality drift is found after molding/extrusion, driving scrap and rework.'
    - 'Lab results arrive late, letting bad material run longer.'
    - Fixed sampling plans waste time or miss emerging risk.
    - >-
      Material and environment variation (lot, moisture, pentane, temp,
      humidity) goes unseen in real time.
    - Inconsistent decisions across shifts increase variability and claims.
    - Dimensional stability issues trigger returns and warranty costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predict OOS risk for density/compression/dimensional stability minutes to
      hours ahead.
    - Recommend setpoint tweaks pre-molding/extrusion to keep runs on target.
    - Dynamically adjust sampling frequency and tests based on risk.
    - >-
      Explain drivers of risk so operators know what to change, not just what’s
      wrong.
    - 'Integrate with PLC/SCADA, LIMS, and ERP; deploy on-prem or cloud.'
    - Continuously learn from lab outcomes and operator feedback.
  features:
    - >-
      Real-time risk scoring from pre-expander, molding/extrusion, and
      environment signals.
    - Explainable AI with top contributors and actionable guidance per run.
    - >-
      Smart sampling plans by SKU/line/shift; AOI and lab load automatically

      speed, and cooling profile.
    - 'Alerts to SCADA/Andon, mobile/email notifications, and approval workflows.'
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability with audit logs, versioned models, and
      role-based access.
    - 'Fast connect via OPC UA/Modbus, REST API, and LIMS/CSV imports.'
    - Edge or cloud deployment with offline resilience and IT-friendly security.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect data: pre-expander, extruder, bead moisture, die pressure, line
      speed, cooling/ambient, and LIMS.
    - Train a baseline model on 4–6 weeks of runs and lab results.
    - Validate against golden runs; set alarm thresholds and sampling rules.
    - 'Pilot on one line to compare scrap, rework, FPY, and lab load.'
    - Go live across lines; enable auto sampling and setpoint recommendations.
    - Monitor drift and refresh models; close the loop with lab outcomes.
