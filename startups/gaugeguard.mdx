  problem:
    - >-
      Off-spec gauge, width, haze, and cross-web profile variation drive 3–7%
      scrap on typical unlaminated film/sheet lines; small drifts often go
      undetected for 20–60 minutes, creating entire off-spec rolls.
    - >-
      Manual SPC (paper or spreadsheets) introduces delays and transcription
      errors; operators rarely maintain real-time control charts during rush
      shifts.
    - >-
      False or noisy alarms from generic thresholds lead to alarm fatigue; true
      anomalies (e.g., die-line, melt fracture, roll slip, edge-bead
      instability) are detected late.
    - >-
      Quality data are siloed in gauges, PLC/SCADA, and QMS; lot genealogy and
      customer COA generation are time-consuming and error-prone.
    - >-
      Chargebacks and customer complaints arise from low Cp/Cpk on critical
      parameters (e.g., Cpk < 1.33), with limited root-cause traceability.
    - >-
      Shortage of on-site data science expertise to build and maintain robust
      anomaly models tuned to polymer, line, and product family.
    - >-
      Adding advanced control software from OEMs can be costly and not
      interoperable across mixed fleets and legacy equipment.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to existing sensors (gauge/thickness, edge/width, haze/gloss,
      temperature, line speed) via OPC UA/Modbus/Kepware/PI/SCADA and stream to
      an edge gateway for sub-second monitoring.
    - >-
      Run domain-tuned SPC (Xbar-R, EWMA, CUSUM) alongside ML anomaly models
      trained on historical runs, patterns like die-line cyclical bands,
      cross-web asymmetry, and winder-induced defects.
    - >-
      Provide operator-first UI with live control charts, cross-web heatmaps,
      drift arrows, and traffic-light alarms; push alerts to Andon, SMS,
      Teams/Slack, and SCADA HMIs.
    - >-
      Auto-tag events (grade change, startup, screen change, die clean) to
      reduce false positives and enable apples-to-apples benchmarking across
      runs and plants.
    - >-
      Automate lot genealogy, COA checks against spec limits, and audit-ready
      SPC reports (ISO 9001, IATF customers) with e-signatures.
    - >-
      Offer optional closed-loop advisory hooks to APC/die-bolt controls and
      recipe management (operator-in-the-loop) to reduce response time while
      maintaining human oversight.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap 20–40%, raise Cpk by 0.3+ on critical parameters, and detect
    process drift in under 2 minutes with plug-and-play, film/sheet-specific
    real-time SPC and ML anomaly detection. Payback in under 3–6 months on a
    typical 5–10 line plant.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Film/sheet-specific anomaly library and cross-web analytics pre-trained on
    mixed-fleet data; certified connectors to major gauge systems;
    operator-first UI and playbooks that cut time-to-value to under 30 days;
    optional advisory hooks to APC for faster stabilization without vendor
    lock-in.

  problem:
    - 'Off-spec gauge, width, and haze slip by until rolls are wasted.'
    - Manual SPC and lab checks are too slow for real-time control.
    - Static thresholds cause alarm fatigue and miss subtle shifts.
    - Root-cause and trend analysis burn hours.
    - 'Data is siloed across lines, labs, and historians.'
    - >-

      fast.
  solution:
    - Live control charts with ML anomaly detection on key film properties.
    - 'Early warnings on drift, oscillation, and pattern violations.'
    - 'Adaptive limits by product, recipe, lane, and zone.'
