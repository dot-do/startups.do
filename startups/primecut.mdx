  problem:
    - >-
      Fresh meat shrink from expiry/overproduction is 2–4% of meat sales,
      eroding margin and ESG goals (e.g., a $4M/store meat dept loses $80k–$160k
      annually).
    - >-
      Markdown decisions are manual and inconsistent by store/manager, leading
      to over/under-discounting and missed sell-through windows.
    - >-
      Lack of SKU-level expiry visibility; many retailers don’t track pack
      date/time-temperature history at the lot level.
    - >-
      Markdowns aren’t synchronized across POS, scales, labels, and e-commerce,
      causing price mismatches, customer friction, and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Corporate has limited guardrails and analytics on markdown ROI; difficult
      to measure impact or enforce best practices across stores.
    - >-
      Demand is volatile (weather, holidays, promotions), and current systems
      don’t adjust daily pricing to clear overstock without excessive margin
      sacrifice.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to POS, scales/labeling systems, production logs, and inventory to
      get SKU/lot-level on-hand, pack dates, and expiry windows.
    - >-
      Forecast short-horizon demand (next 1–5 days) at store-SKU level using
      seasonality, day-of-week, promotions, weather/events, and local traffic.
    - >-
      Optimize daily (and intra-day) markdowns for near-expiry/overstock SKUs
      under guardrails (margin floors, price image, minimum advertised price
      policies, label rules).
    - >-
      Automate label printing and price updates across POS, scales, ESLs, and
      e-commerce, ensuring accurate, compliant execution.
    - >-
      Provide store-facing mobile workflows for recommended actions and backroom
      pulls; provide HQ dashboards for ROI, compliance, and A/B testing.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from outcomes to refine models, seasonality, and local
      patterns; run controlled experiments to quantify uplift and tune
      guardrails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce meat waste by 20–35% and lift gross profit 0.5–1.5% of meat sales
    with AI-driven daily markdowns that optimize sell-through before
    expiry—deployed in 8 weeks, with guaranteed ROI or fee credit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Meat-specialized expiry models combining cut-level decay curves, packaging,
    and time-temperature data; deep integrations with scale/label equipment for
    execution; and validated case studies quantifying ROI—difficult for generic
    pricing tools to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Meat retail operators (category managers and meat department leads) who must
    clear perishable inventory daily without sacrificing margin.
  problem: >-
    Perishable SKUs have short shelf life and volatile demand; manual markdowns
    are guesswork. Teams feel constant pressure to hit shrink and margin
    targets. It’s wrong to waste good food or discount blindly when data can
    price fairly and profitably.
  guide: >-
    We understand the daily grind of shrink, safety dates, and labor limits. Our
    AI is trained on your POS, inventory, and demand signals to deliver
    explainable, audit-ready pricing that’s proven to lift sell-through and
    protect margin.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect POS/inventory data; 2) Set business rules, guardrails, and
    regions; 3) Receive daily, store/SKU/pack-date markdowns pushed to
    labels/apps; 4) Monitor results in a shrink/margin dashboard; 5) Iterate and
    automate to your comfort level.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo and run a 30-day, two-store pilot with clear
    success criteria. Transitional: Download the Perishable Markdown Playbook
    and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Right price, right time, right pack: higher sell-through before expiry,
    lower shrink, protected margin, smoother workflows, and teams focused on
    serving shoppers—not firefighting pricing.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means spoilage from overstock, margin erosion from last-minute
    deep cuts, compliance risk, and burned-out teams juggling spreadsheets.
