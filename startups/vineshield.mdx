leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Disease pressure (powdery mildew, downy mildew, botrytis) causes 5–20%
      average yield/quality loss annually in susceptible regions, with
      catastrophic losses >40% in outbreak years.
    - >-
      Wineries often default to calendar-based sprays (7–14 day intervals),
      leading to over- or under-application; both increase costs and risk of
      residues or crop loss.
    - >-
      Current risk tools are fragmented (manual Gubler-Thomas lookups, generic
      weather apps) and do not translate risk into block-level, actionable spray
      windows aligned with label constraints, sprayer capacity, and weather.
    - >-
      Resistance management and MRL compliance are hard to coordinate across
      multiple blocks, growers, and FRAC codes without decision support.
    - >-
      Operational constraints (wind, temperature, inversion layers, sprayer
      availability, labor) are not incorporated into existing tools, causing
      missed optimal windows and re-sprays.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven disease risk index by block for powdery mildew, downy mildew,
      and botrytis, calibrated by cultivar, canopy density, and phenological
      stage.
    - >-
      48–72-hour forward spray window recommendations incorporating wind,
      temperature, humidity, inversion risk, label intervals, and
      re-entry/preharvest intervals.
    - >-
      Automated FRAC-code rotation planning and MRL compliance checks by target
      export market (EU/UK/JP/CA/US).
    - >-
      Capacity-aware spray schedule optimizer (considers sprayer count, tank
      size, speed, labor shifts, refill logistics) to maximize acres treated in
      safe windows.
    - >-
      Mobile and SMS/Email alerts for threshold exceedance, window
      openings/closures, re-spray timers, and missed-treatment risk.
    - >-
      Integrations with on-farm stations (Pessl/Metos, Davis/Onset, Arable),
      mesoscale weather grids, and farm management systems (Agworld, CropTrak)
      for spray diary sync.
    - >-

      timing adherence, and ROI tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  character: >-
    Vineyard and winery teams (viticulturists, ranch managers, winemakers) who
    must protect fruit quality and budget while timing sprays across blocks.
  problem: >-
    External: Microclimate-driven disease pressure shifts daily; labor, wind,
    and label limits shrink spray windows. Internal: guessing breeds stress and
    costly over/under-spraying. Philosophical: growers shouldn’t have to gamble
    with fruit quality.
  guide: >-
    We’ve managed blocks through tight windows and surprise outbreaks. Built by
    viticulturists and plant pathologists using AI on hyperlocal weather and
    canopy models; validated across AVAs; integrates with stations and spray
    logs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect blocks and weather source. 2) Receive daily block-level risk
    scores for powdery mildew, botrytis, and downy mildew. 3) Get optimal spray
    windows and interval guidance with alerts. 4) Export plans to work orders
    and compliance logs. 5) Review impact and adjust. Data stays yours; cancel
    anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14-day trial or book a 20-minute demo. Transitional:
    Download a sample block report and a regional disease-risk calendar.
  success: >-
    Clean fruit, fewer and better-timed sprays, documented and defensible
    decisions, resistance stewardship, predictable costs, smoother crew
    scheduling, and confident harvest-ready blocks.
  failure: >-
    Missed windows, outbreaks, wasted passes, resistance pressure, residue
    issues, lost yield and quality, overtime and re-sprays, and weak
    documentation during audits.
