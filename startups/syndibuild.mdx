  problem:
    - >-
      Manual listing creation for new specs and communities takes 1–3 hours per
      asset, delaying time-to-market and increasing carrying costs on inventory.
    - >-
      Status/price changes are not propagated consistently across portals and
      social, causing stale listings, wasted ad spend, and consumer complaints.
    - >-
      Community and floor plan pages underperform in SEO; portals outrank
      builder sites for brand/community queries, reducing direct, lower-cost
      leads.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (Fair Housing, Special Ad Category on Meta/Google, ADA
      alt-text) require specialized review that most teams lack bandwidth to
      manage at scale.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (ERP/build, CRM, website CMS, portal feeds, social
      schedulers) force duplicate data entry and error-prone workflows.
    - >-
      Attribution is weak; marketers cannot see listing completeness, feed
      freshness, and channel ROI in one place, making budget optimization
      difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-generated, builder-branded copy for specs, floor plans, and
      communities, including meta data, schema, alt-text, and disclaimers tuned
      for Fair Housing and platform policies.
    - >-
      Automated syndication to major new-home portals and social channels, with
      deduping, UTM governance, and near-real-time feed updates upon
      status/price changes.
    - >-
      SEO asset generation for builder sites: community/floor plan pages,
      neighborhood guides, FAQ blocks, and internal linking suggestions, plus
      XML sitemap and schema.
    - >-
      Social content packs per spec/community (post variants, stories,
      short-form video scripts) and dynamic product feeds for Meta Advantage+
      and Google Performance Max (housing policy compliant).
    - >-
      Feed QA and listing health scoring: completeness, media count, policy risk
      flags, and change-detection to catch stale or inconsistent listings.
    - >-
      Unified analytics: source/medium attribution, per-portal performance,
      lead-to-appointment conversion, CPL/CPA, feed freshness SLA monitoring,
      and A/B test results.
    - >-
      Integrations with CRMs (Lasso/ECI, Salesforce, HubSpot), builder
      ERPs/project systems (Hyphen BRIX, Buildertrend, ECI MarkSystems,
      Constellation NewStar), and common CMSs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review queues for compliance-sensitive language,
      community amenities, school references, and fair housing edge cases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Launch and keep every spec and community listing accurate, SEO-optimized,
    and compliant everywhere in under an hour—cut time-to-market by 90%, reduce
    CPL 15–25%, and centralize attribution across portals and social.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned content and compliance engine plus prebuilt syndication
    connectors for the new-home ecosystem, enabling near-real-time, policy-safe
    updates at scale. Early portal/CRM partnerships and a growing corpus of
    builder-branded, performance-labeled content create a feedback moat that
    generic AI or agencies lack.
