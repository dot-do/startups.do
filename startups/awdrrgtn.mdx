leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High and volatile water and pumping energy costs with tightening
      allocations; growers need to reduce acre-inches pumped without risking
      yield.
    - >-
      AWD is proven but operationally hard: timing drain/reflood windows around
      rainfall and crop stage is labor-intensive and error-prone.
    - >-
      Limited field-level guidance tailored to rice levees/soils; most tools are
      built for row crops and don’t model flooded paddy dynamics.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: weather, soils, planting dates, pump capacity, and
      field water levels are not integrated into a single, actionable schedule.
    - >-
      Risk perception: fear of yield loss from over-drying leads to
      over-irrigation and missed savings.
    - >-
      Compliance and reporting burden for programs (e.g., EQIP, mill
      sustainability, water districts) and carbon/MRV requires credible
      documentation of water and methane reductions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly AWD irrigation plan per field that optimizes drain/reflood windows
      using localized weather, crop stage, soil percolation, and pump capacity.
    - >-
      Daily alerts: when to shut off pumps, when to reflood, and when rainfall
      will safely cover the next flood.
    - >-
      Simple, low-connectivity delivery: SMS summaries + mobile app maps;
      optional sensor integrations for automation.
    - >-
      Program reporting: auto-generated reports quantifying acre-inches saved,
      pump-hours avoided, and estimated methane reductions.
    - >-
      Risk controls: minimum water table thresholds by growth stage to protect
      yield; override logic for heat stress or disease risk.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Rice-specific, AI-driven AWD schedules that save 20–30% irrigation water and
    10–25% pumping energy with no yield loss, delivered via low-friction SMS/app
    and backed by field-validated models and program-ready reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built AWD engine for rice with validated field results across major
    U.S. soils, SAR-based flood verification, and turnkey program reporting that
    enables mills/districts to scale AWD while offering growers a simple SMS
    workflow and risk safeguards—hard to replicate without rice-specific
    datasets and partnerships.

  character: >-
    Rice growers and farm managers who want to cut water use and pumping costs
    without risking yield.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable weather, limited allocations, and manual flood checks make it
    hard to know when to dry or re-flood; guesswork wastes water or risks yield
    loss.

    AWD Irrigation & Water-Saving Schedule for Rice is your AI agronomy
    assistant. We understand rice irrigation is high‑stakes and combine local
    weather, soil, and crop stage with proven AWD research to give clear, safe
    irrigation timing.
  plan: >-
    1) Set up fields: boundaries, soil, planting date, and water source (we
    auto‑pull local weather). 2) Get a weekly AWD plan with safe thresholds,
    pump run‑times, and alerts for re‑flooding. 3) Irrigate and log; we
    auto‑adjust and provide compliance‑ready reports.
  callToAction: Start a free 1‑field trial and get your first AWD schedule this week.
  success: >-
    Use 15–30% less water with equal yield, lower pumping costs, fewer field
    visits, compliance-ready records, and reduced methane emissions.
  failure: >-
    Keep over‑irrigating, paying more for pumping, missing optimal timing,
    risking stress‑related yield loss, and falling short on water and
    sustainability targets.
