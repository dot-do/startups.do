  problem:
    - >-
      Rice farmers face water scarcity and rising pumping costs; AWD is proven
      to save 15–30% water but adoption is low due to fear of yield loss and
      lack of field-specific guidance.
    - >-
      Irrigation decisions are based on intuition rather than data (rain
      forecasts, evapotranspiration, soil type), leading to over-irrigation and
      methane emissions.
    - >-
      Water User Associations (WUAs)/irrigation districts struggle to coordinate
      turns; lack of field-level water accounting causes conflicts and
      inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Existing advisories are generic, not tuned to paddy water depth dynamics;
      manual AWD tubes lack scale and actionable alerts.
    - >-
      Digital tools often assume smartphones and high literacy; many rice
      farmers rely on feature phones, local languages, and offline workflows.
    - >-
      Compliance and proof for sustainability programs (methane reduction from
      AWD) are hard without low-cost MRV (measurement, reporting, verification).
  solution:
    - >-
      Generate per-field irrigation schedules (AWD safe/strict or continuous
      flood) using a water-balance model combining ET0, crop growth stage, soil
      texture, bund leakage, percolation, and 7–10 day rainfall forecasts.
    - >-
      Provide actionable alerts: when to irrigate (e.g., when water level
      reaches −15 cm safe threshold), rain-skip recommendations, and turn-taking
      coordination for WUAs.
    - >-
      Water-use tracking via simple farmer inputs (pump ON/OFF, hours, water
      depth proxy) and optional telemetry; convert to water volume and energy
      cost saved.
    - >-
      Remote-sensing validation: Sentinel-1 SAR for inundation/wet/dry status
      and Sentinel-2 for canopy stage to auto-calibrate schedules and verify AWD
      adherence.
    - >-
      Offline-first and low-literacy access: SMS/USSD flows, WhatsApp/IVR voice
      in local languages, printable calendars for field huts and WUA notice
      boards.
    - >-
      MRV data pack: audited logs, satellite indicators, and modeled reductions
      to plug into Verra/Gold Standard methodologies for methane reduction from
      AWD.
    - >-
      Dashboards for agronomists/WUAs: field maps, upcoming irrigation windows,
      aggregate water balance, and compliance reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-specific, low-friction AWD irrigation plans and alerts that cut water
    use and energy costs by 15–25% without yield penalty, verified with
    satellite + weather data and ready for carbon-credit MRV—delivered via
    SMS/WhatsApp/IVR in local languages and coordinated at the WUA level.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rice-specialized AWD decision engine calibrated with SAR-derived
    inundation time series and ground truth across diverse geographies,
    delivered through ultra-low-friction channels (SMS/IVR/WhatsApp) plus
    WUA-level coordination and ready-to-audit MRV that unlocks carbon revenue
    for growers—difficult to replicate quickly without datasets, local
    partnerships, and regulatory acceptance.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rice growers and farm managers who want reliable yields while using less
    water, energy, and labor.
  problem: >-
    Uncertain water supply and rising costs, methane and compliance pressure,
    and the risk of yield loss from mistimed wetting/drying. They’re tired of
    guessing irrigation timing and hand-tracking water use.
  guide: >-
    AWD Irrigation Scheduling & Water Balance Advisory is your agronomy +
    irrigation guide. We understand flood timing stress. Built by irrigation
    engineers and rice specialists, validated in AWD programs, and integrated
    with weather and sensors to deliver confident, field-specific decisions.
  plan: >-
    1) Onboard fields: boundaries, soil, variety, planting dates; connect
    pumps/meters or optional sensors. 2) Receive a field‑specific AWD (Alternate
    Wetting and Drying) or continuous‑flood schedule with safe trigger levels.
    3) Get alerts, adjust with one tap, and track water use, runtimes, and
    compliance. Data stays yours; schedules prioritize yield protection.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot on one field. Transitional: Book a 15‑minute
    demo or download the AWD checklist and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Save 20–40% irrigation water and 10–30% pumping energy, maintain or improve
    yields, cut methane 20–50%, qualify for incentives, reduce field checks, and
    keep a clean water‑use record with peace‑of‑mind alerts.
  failure: >-
    Without it: wasted water and fuel, over‑ or under‑drying that risks yield,
    missed AWD incentives and compliance, higher methane footprint, and long
    nights chasing gates and pumps.
