  problem:
    - >-
      Static routes cause unnecessary miles and labor, because refill priority
      changes throughout the day as machines go critical.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time visibility into driver progress, ETAs, and
      machine status, leading to late or missed service and stockouts.
    - >-
      Existing VMS routing is often batch/planned the night before, not
      re-optimized when drivers fall behind, traffic spikes, or machines
      unexpectedly sell out.
    - >-
      Picklists are not dynamically adjusted to actual machine demand, causing
      partial fills, repeat trips, and higher out-of-stocks.
    - >-
      Dispatchers spend excessive time on manual reassignments and calls/texts
      with drivers, with no measurable SLA adherence or ETA accuracy.
    - >-
      Small-to-mid operators lack data science/OR expertise to build reliable,
      constraint-aware routing (service windows, capacity, access rules, cash
      collection), ETAs, and re-optimization at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand-aware daily route planning: Optimize morning routes using
      forecasted sales/criticality, service windows, vehicle capacity, and
      skills/access constraints.
    - >-
      Live re-optimization: Re-route in seconds when machines go critical,
      drivers fall behind, traffic changes, or unplanned stops occur—without
      overloading dispatchers.
    - >-
      Driver app with live ETAs and dynamic picklists: Turn-by-turn, store-level
      notes, offline mode, photo proof, and auto-updated picklists based on
      planograms/telemetry.
    - >-
      Dispatcher command center: Map of all drivers, color-coded SLAs, exception
      queue (critical machines, late ETAs), one-click reassignment.
    - >-
      Predictive stockout prevention: Machine-level sell-through forecasts and
      criticality scoring to prioritize stops and reduce lost sales.
    - >-
      Closed-loop performance analytics: Baseline vs. post-implementation KPIs
      (miles, stops, stockouts, on-time rate, labor utilization) with ROI
      reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, vending-specific live dispatch that continuously re-optimizes
    routes using real-time machine telemetry and driver progress—cutting miles
    and stockouts while guaranteeing accurate ETAs and SLA compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    1) Connect: Link machine sales/pars, locations, service windows, and
    fleet/driver data. 2) Optimize: Auto-build daily routes with ETAs and push
    to driver apps. 3) Orchestrate: Monitor live progress; when machines go
    critical or drivers slip, re-optimize with one tap.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14-day pilot using your real routes. Transitional: Book a
    20-minute demo and get a custom ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Fewer stockouts, 15–25% fewer miles, less overtime, dependable ETAs, happier
    accounts, and a calm, data-driven dispatch room.
