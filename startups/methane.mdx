  problem:
    - >-
      Methane and CO excursions in underground coal mines cause evacuations,
      stoppages, and fatalities; current systems are largely threshold-based and
      reactive, not predictive.
    - >-
      Alarm fatigue from hundreds of threshold alarms/day leads to
      desensitization and slow response; root-cause correlations across methane,
      CO, airflow, barometric pressure, and equipment status are rarely analyzed
      in real time.
    - >-
      Ventilation networks are dynamic (door positions, fan speed, stoppings,
      regulator changes, longwall moves), making fixed thresholds unreliable and
      causing frequent nuisance trips.
    - >-
      Manual trend review by ventilation officers is time-consuming (often 2–4
      hours/week per panel) and misses fast-evolving precursors (e.g.,
      barometric dips, shearer cutting zones, drainage variability).
    - >-
      Regulatory compliance (e.g., MSHA 30 CFR Part 75, AU Coal Mining Safety
      and Health Regulation) requires documented monitoring and responses;
      generating auditable evidence is cumbersome and often after-the-fact.
    - >-
      Unplanned gas-related stoppages can cost USD 30k–150k per hour in lost
      production and re-entry delays; even a single quarterly event materially
      impacts mine EBITDA.
    - >-
      Existing OEM monitoring systems (SCADA/PLC/AMS) provide data but limited
      predictive analytics, cross-sensor correlation, or actionable advisory
      playbooks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time sensor streams (methane, CO, airflow, pressure, fan
      speed, equipment states) via OPC UA/Modbus/MQTT from existing AMS/SCADA.
    - >-
      Edge AI anomaly detection with physics-informed models and
      digital-ventilation context, delivering 10–60 minute early warnings and
      ranked probable causes.
    - >-
      Actionable advisories mapped to site SOPs (e.g., inspect goaf seals,
      adjust regulator, verify methane drainage flow, check water sprays), with
      one-click acknowledgment and guided checklists.
    - >-
      Explainability dashboards showing contributing sensors, trend deltas,
      barometric influence, and ventilation topology overlays for rapid triage.
    - >-
      Offline-capable edge gateway (IECEx/ATEX certified enclosure) ensuring
      on-site inference with <10 s alert latency; cloud for fleet learning and
      benchmarking.
    - >-
      Alarm management aligned to ISA 18.2: deduplication, suppression by state,
      dynamic thresholds by panel state/production phase.
    - >-
      Automated compliance logging: event timelines, actions taken, response
      time, and export to MSHA/Inspector reports.
    - >-
      Model lifecycle management: site-specific calibration, drift detection,
      and assisted labeling using incident reviews; human-in-the-loop for
      continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict and explain abnormal methane/CO/airflow patterns 10–60 minutes
    before thresholds are breached, with clear, site-specific checklists that
    reduce nuisance alarms 40–60%, cut gas-related stoppages 20–40%, and
    generate audit-ready compliance records without replacing existing sensors
    or SCADA.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary multi-variable, ventilation-aware models trained on diverse mine
    conditions; validated advisory playbooks co-developed with leading
    ventilation engineers; edge-first architecture certified for hazardous

    1) Connect: Ingest methane, CO, airflow, and operational data; map tags and
    layouts. 2) Calibrate: Baseline normal patterns and co-design alert
    thresholds and playbooks with your SMEs. 3) Deploy: Real-time early warnings
    plus recommended checks before limits are breached; weekly trend reviews and
    continuous tuning.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a ventilation risk review and start a site pilot.
    Transitional: Request a sample alert playbook and trend report.
  success: >-
