  steps:
    - Detect scale and extract quantities (areas/lengths/counts) for assemblies
    - Map assemblies to branch SKUs and unit conversions
    - 'Price with current costs, margin rules, and available substitutions'
    - Check stock/lead times and split by delivery dates if needed
    - Create quote in ERP/CPQ; route to human reviewer (optional)

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual plan takeoffs are slow (1–4 hours per plan per trade), limiting
      quote throughput and delaying contractor bids.
    - >-
      Estimating accuracy varies by estimator and branch, causing margin leakage
      (1–2% gross margin) and costly change orders due to omissions (e.g.,
      fasteners, clips, underlayment).
    - >-
      Mapping quantities to each branch’s specific catalog SKUs and assemblies
      is tedious and error-prone; mismatched SKUs break pricing and inventory
      checks.
    - >-
      Branch quotes aren’t consistently tied to real-time pricing and local
      availability, resulting in rework, substitutions, and order changes after
      award.
    - >-
      Estimator hiring is difficult; experienced estimators are retiring,
      creating capacity constraints and training burden on new hires.
    - >-
      Existing takeoff tools (PlanSwift/STACK/Bluebeam) are manual; ERP quoting
      (Epicor/DMSi/Spruce) lacks automated plan-to-SKU conversion, forcing
      swivel-chair workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests PDFs (single/multi-sheet), auto-detects scales and relevant
      sheets, and extracts architectural/structural/roof schedules.
    - >-
      Trade modules generate BOMs: lumber framing (stud/plate counts,
      headers/LVL placeholders, sheathing, nails), drywall (board sizes, layers,
      tapes/mud/fasteners), roofing (squares, ridge/hip, underlayment, flashing,
      drip edge).
    - >-
      Apply branch-configured assemblies and waste factors; map to
      branch-specific SKUs (good/better/best) with alternates.
    - >-
      Pull real-time pricing and availability from ERP; auto-select in-stock
      equivalents; flag long lead items.
    - >-
      Estimator review UI with line-by-line confidence, visual overlays, and
      change-diffing for revisions (A, B, C sets).
    - >-
      One-click export to ERP quote/sales order; attach plan, BOM, and audit
      trail. API endpoints for custom workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA for edge cases; feedback loops continuously improve
      model per branch.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From PDF plan to priced, branch-catalog quote in minutes. Trade-specific AI
    takeoff (lumber, drywall, roofing) mapped to your SKUs, priced from your
    ERP, with estimator review and confidence scoring—cut quote turnaround by
    60–80%, improve win rate, and protect margins via consistent assemblies.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Dealer-specific plan-to-SKU dataset and assemblies (including alternates and
    waste factors) that compounds with each quote; deep ERP integrations and
    feedback loops tied to actual pricing/availability; trade-specific AI tuned
    with human-in-the-loop QA, yielding measurable accuracy and speed that
    generic takeoff tools cannot match.

  character: >-
    Branch managers and estimators at other building material dealers (NAICS
    444180) who want fast, accurate takeoffs and priced quotes mapped to their
    branch catalog to win more bids and protect margins.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual takeoffs are slow, error-prone, and inconsistent; skilled
    estimators are scarce; quotes often miss current SKUs/pricing.

    - Internal: Teams feel overloaded and worry about missed items, margin
    leakage, and lost credibility.

    - Philosophical: Dealers shouldn’t lose jobs because paperwork takes longer
    than building.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand bid deadlines, staff shortages, and messy plan sets
    that force late-night takeoffs.

    - Authority: Purpose-built AI for lumber, drywall, and roofing; maps to your
    catalog and pricing; integrates with common dealer ERP/POS; accuracy you can
    validate in a pilot.
  plan: |-
    Process:
    1) Upload plans and select material scopes/branch.
    2) AI generates a takeoff and maps SKUs to your catalog and pricing.
    3) Review/adjust, then export a ready-to-send quote or push to ERP/POS.
    Risk Reduction:
    - Start with a pilot on past jobs.
    - Human-in-the-loop review and audit trail.
    - Data isolation and secure access controls.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a pilot with 10 free takeoffs.

    - Transitional: Download sample outputs, an accuracy checklist, and an ROI
    calculator.
  success: |-
    - Quotes in minutes, not days.
    - Higher win rates with consistent, defensible estimates.
    - Protected margins via precise SKU mapping and current pricing.
    - Scale estimating capacity without new hires.
    - Fewer jobsite surprises and happier contractors.
  failure: |-
