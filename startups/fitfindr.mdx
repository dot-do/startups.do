  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers struggle to choose the correct instrument size or accessory spec
      online (e.g., violin size, string gauge, reed strength), causing
      indecision, cart abandonment, and high return rates.
    - >-
      Retailers lack knowledgeable staff coverage across channels and hours;
      live chat queues and phone consults don’t scale during peaks.
    - >-
      Generic site search and chatbots don’t map musical specs to customer needs
      (scale length, mouthpiece tip opening, stick taper), leading to poor
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Bundles and add‑ons (strings, reeds, cases, cables) are under-attached
      because guidance is not contextualized to the main purchase and live
      inventory.
    - >-
      Inventory inaccuracies lead to recommending out-of-stock items, eroding
      trust and conversion.
    - >-
      Content and fit guides are scattered, static, and not connected to live
      catalog data, reducing their effectiveness.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational fit finder flows for key categories (orchestral strings
      sizing, guitar/bass string gauges by tuning/scale length, reed strength by
      experience/mouthpiece, drumstick profile by genre/grip, case sizing by
      model, audio interfaces by I/O/DAW/OS).
    - >-
      Live inventory-aware recommendations that substitute intelligently when
      OOS, with lead-time messaging; adds primary item plus optimized accessory
      bundle directly to cart.
    - >-
      Prebuilt MI ontology and rules engine mapping specs to needs; reinforced
      by retrieval-augmented generation from retailer catalogs and manufacturer
      guides.
    - >-
      One-click integrations with Shopify/BigCommerce/Magento carts, product
      catalogs, and POS/ERP inventory (e.g., Lightspeed, Epicor, NCR
      Counterpoint) for <5-minute stock freshness.
    - >-
      Analytics and A/B testing: conversion lift, attach rate, return-rate
      deltas, acceptance rate of recommendations, OOS avoidance, revenue impact.
    - >-
      Omnichannel: web widget, mobile, SMS, QR-triggered in-aisle kiosk mode,
      and agent-handoff to human support with context transcript.
    - >-
      Multilingual guidance and localized size/spec mapping;
      accessibility-compliant UI.
    - >-
      Admin tools: tune fit rules, manage synonym/spec mapping, promote vendor
      content, configure bundles, set substitution rules.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Expert-grade, inventory-aware fit and bundle recommendations for musical
    gear that increase conversion 10–25%, boost accessory attach rates 15–30%,
    and cut fit-related returns 10–25%—deployed in weeks and measurable via
    clear A/B tests.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated MI-specific knowledge graph and fit rules, continuously enriched
    with anonymized cross-retailer performance data and validated by domain
    experts—plus deep, certified integrations with MI-relevant POS/ERP and
    manufacturer data feeds that generic chatbots and search tools lack.

    External: Shoppers are unsure about instrument size, string gauge, reed
    strength, sticks, cases, and audio interfaces; complex catalogs and
    fluctuating stock; unclear bundles.

    Internal: Teams are stretched answering “will this fit?”; fear of returns
