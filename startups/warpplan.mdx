  problem:
    - >-
      Textile bag and canvas mills face volatile SKU-level demand driven by
      promotions, seasonality, and contract cycles, leading to forecast errors
      >25% MAPE and excess inventory or stockouts.
    - >-
      Planners spend 10–20 hours/week manually building MPS in spreadsheets that
      ignore real finite capacity, changeovers, and material constraints,
      causing infeasible or unstable schedules.
    - >-
      High changeover times on looms, dyeing, and sewing lines lead to
      underutilization (60–75%) and rush overtime costs due to poor sequencing.
    - >-
      Material availability (fabric rolls, dye lots, zippers, threads, handles)
      and variable supplier lead times are not linked to the plan, creating
      last-minute expedites and OTIF misses.
    - >-
      Existing generic APS/IBP tools are expensive, slow to implement (6–12
      months), and require deep modeling expertise; smaller mills lack resources
      to configure them effectively.
    - >-
      Lack of SKU attribute-level modeling for new or low-history SKUs causes
      poor new-product forecasts and write-offs.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI forecasting: Hierarchical SKU/location forecasts with causal factors
      (seasonality, promos, holidays, weather proxies, macro), attribute-based
      demand modeling for new SKUs, and exception-based overrides.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity MPS: Constraint-aware plan across looms, dyeing, cutting,
      and sewing lines, considering changeover matrices, batch sizes, preventive
      maintenance, labor shifts, and rush orders.
    - >-
      Material-constrained planning: Time-phased material availability, dye
      lot/color matching, fabric roll width/length constraints, and supplier
      lead-time variability with safety stock logic.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: What-if simulations for demand surges, capacity
      outages, and supplier delays; compare OTIF, margin, and utilization
      outcomes.
    - >-
      Smart sequencing: Color and fabric batching to minimize changeovers and
      waste; line balancing for cut-and-sew to hit due dates with minimal
      overtime.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: Daily replan with incremental rescheduling; APIs to
      ERP/MES/WMS for order, BOM, and inventory sync.
    - >-
      Explainability and governance: Forecast drivers, MAPE by hierarchy, plan
      adherence, and audit trail for S&OP sign-off.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast demand at the SKU and attribute level and automatically generate a
    feasible, capacity- and material-constrained master production
    schedule—purpose-built for textile bag and canvas mills—implemented in
    weeks, not months, with measurable gains in service level, utilization, and
    inventory turns.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A textile-specific planning stack combining attribute-level demand models
    with a pre-built constraint library for looms/dyeing/cut-and-sew and color
    batching—delivering feasible plans out-of-the-box. Rapid connectors and
    implementation templates reduce time-to-value to weeks, while accumulating
    domain data from pilots continuously improves models and benchmarks
    competitors cannot easily replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations leaders at textile bag and canvas mills who must deliver on-time
    orders profitably while juggling hundreds of SKUs.
  problem: >-
    They can’t reliably forecast demand at the SKU level or translate it into a
    feasible master production schedule. Spreadsheets ignore machine, labor, and
    fabric constraints, causing stockouts, rush costs, excess inventory, and
    late shipments. Planners feel stuck firefighting when planning should be
    clear, data-driven, and calm.
  guide: >-
    We’re a specialized AI planning partner for textile mills. Our platform
    forecasts demand per SKU and auto-builds a capacity- and material-feasible
    MPS, supported by domain experts who guide setup, change management, and
    continuous improvement.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES and 24+ months of sales, BOMs, routings, and capacity
    data. 2) Receive SKU-level forecasts and a constraint-feasible MPS with
    what-if scenarios in 2 weeks. 3) Go live with weekly replans, alerts, and
    S&OP reviews for sustained performance.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 30-day pilot with your data.
  success: >-
    Confident plans and calm execution: higher OTIF, lower inventory and
    expedites, fewer changeovers, stable schedules, better margins, and happier
    customers.
  failure: >-
    Without it, planning stays reactive: unreliable forecasts, infeasible
    schedules, overtime, wasted fabric, missed due dates, and lost customers.

  problem:
    - Volatile demand by color/size/print causes stockouts and overproduction.
    - >-
      Spreadsheet forecasts break at SKU level; bias and stale assumptions
      persist.
    - >-

      variable supplier lead times not modeled.
    - 'Changeovers, dye lots, and minimum batch sizes are hard to plan manually.'
    - 'Fragmented data across ERP, distributors, and e‑commerce slows decisions.'
    - Planners can’t give reliable promise dates; WIP and cash pile up.
