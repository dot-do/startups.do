  problem:
    - >-
      Creating permit-ready SWPPPs is slow and inconsistent (8–24 labor hours
      per project) and often requires expensive consultants.
    - >-
      BMP layouts are frequently non-optimized, leading to cost overruns (over-
      or under-installation) and change orders in the field.
    - >-
      Contractors miss regulatory rain-event triggers (e.g., ≥0.5 in/24hr
      forecast thresholds), causing non-compliance, rework, and potential fines
      ($2,500–$10,000 per day in some jurisdictions).
    - >-
      Inspection scheduling and documentation are fragmented across
      spreadsheets, PDFs, and email, increasing audit risk and admin burden.
    - >-
      Regulations vary by state/permit; teams struggle to keep templates
      current, leading to rejected submittals and permit delays.
    - >-
      Field crews lack a simple, mobile workflow to capture photos, as-built
      BMPs, and corrective actions linked to weather events.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted SWPPP authoring: ingest grading plans (PDF/DWG), parcel
      boundaries, soils, hydrology, and permit to draft a permit-compliant SWPPP
      with local/state clauses and BMP notes.
    - >-
      Smart BMP layout: algorithmically places silt fence, check dams, inlet
      protection, stabilized entrances, sediment basins, etc., optimized by
      slopes, flow paths, soils, and staging; editable by field teams.
    - >-
      Rain Event Action Plan (REAP): weather-integrated triggers based on permit
      thresholds; auto-generate pre-, during-, and post-storm checklists,
      assignments, and notifications.
    - >-
      Inspection engine: configurable frequencies (e.g., weekly and within 24–48
      hrs after QRE), mobile photo logs, GPS-tagging, punch lists, and
      audit-ready reports.
    - >-
      Compliance library: state-specific clauses, training logs, and forms
      (e.g., CA CGP REAP, TX TPDES, FL CGP) maintained and versioned.
    - >-
      Integrations: NOAA/NWS forecast feeds, Esri/Mapbox basemaps,
      Procore/Autodesk Construction Cloud for drawings and RFIs; export to
      PDF/DOCX and CAD underlays.
    - >-
      Analytics & ROI: track BMP costs, inspection completion, rain-trigger
      response times, and non-compliance risk indicators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate permit-ready, site-specific SWPPP and BMP layout from plans/GIS in
    hours (not days), with automated rain-event action plans and inspection
    scheduling that cut admin by 50% and reduce non-compliance risk by
    delivering the right actions at the right time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Permit-aware, jurisdiction-mapped SWPPP/REAP rule engine combined with AI
    layout that learns from thousands of real projects and outcomes;
    integrations embedded in contractor workflows (Procore/Autodesk) and a
    regulator-validated template library that competitors and generic inspection
    tools lack. Data-network effects improve BMP placement and REAP
    effectiveness over time.
