  problem:
    - >-
      Peak-hour station/stop dwell times (typ. 25–55s with 90th percentile
      outliers >90s) and high variance erode line capacity, increase headway
      instability, and propagate delays; agencies lack a fast, low-capex lever
      to add throughput.
    - >-
      Agencies rely on infrequent, manual time-and-motion surveys (1–2
      weeks/year) that miss seasonality, special events, and operational drift;
      root causes (fare validation, mobility device boarding, crowding, door
      policy, signage) aren’t quantified granularly.
    - >-
      Platform staffing and door policies are static or heuristic-based; no
      continuous, data-driven approach to position staff or set policies by
      station, time-of-day, or event to reduce dwell and variance.
    - >-
      Signage/wayfinding changes are often subjective and not empirically
      validated; agencies lack a controlled experimentation framework to measure
      impact per station and avoid costly missteps.
    - >-
      Safety/ADA/union constraints limit interventions; without prescriptive,
      compliant recommendations, change adoption stalls.
    - >-
      Adding trains/buses or capital upgrades is costly and time-consuming;
      reducing dwell by 5–15% can reclaim capacity at a fraction of the cost,
      but current tools don’t deliver prescriptive, measurable improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-source data ingestion and normalization: connectors for CCTV/VMS,
      APC, AFC/faregates/validators, CAD/AVL/ATS, door/vehicle logs, occupancy
      sensors.
    - >-
      AI dwell decomposition: classify and quantify contributors (crowding, fare
      conflicts, wheelchair/stroller/bike boardings, door obstructions, platform
      conflicts, curvature/gap mitigation, train alignment issues).
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommender: optimal door policies (e.g., all-door vs
      controlled boarding), queue guides, platform markers, boarding/alighting
      separation, event-specific crowd control, stanchions/barriers layout, pa
      announcements cadence.
    - >-
      Staffing optimizer: dynamic platform/ambassador allocation by 15–30 minute
      intervals and station zones to minimize dwell and variance given staffing
      constraints and union rules.
    - >-
      Signage/wayfinding designer: data-driven placement and wording
      suggestions; heatmaps of flow; integration with signage CMS for rapid
      pilots.
    - >-
      Digital twin and what-if simulation: test interventions virtually; predict
      dwell/variance, OTP and throughput impact, and monetized ROI before
      fielding.
    - >-
      Experimentation framework: station-level A/B or stepped-wedge trials with
      automatic impact attribution, safety guardrails, and rollback plans.
    - >-
      Operational playbooks and change kits: printable floor plans, shift
      rosters, announcement scripts, training modules, and stakeholder memos
      linked to each recommendation.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and alerts: dwell deviation detection,
      upstream/downstream propagation risk, and automated post-implementation
      reviews with KPI tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn-key, privacy-preserving AI that decomposes dwell by root cause using
    multi-source data (video, APC, AFC, CAD/AVL, door logs) and prescribes
    targeted actions (door policy, staffing, signage/wayfinding) validated via
    simulation and A/B tests—delivering 8–12% average peak dwell reduction and
    15–25% 90th-percentile reduction within 90 days at pilot stations, with
    ADA/union-safe playbooks and quantified ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-agency labeled dwell dataset and prescriptive playbooks tied to proven
    KPI lifts; privacy-by-design video pipeline pre-vetted by major agencies;
    deep connector library to AFC/CAD/AVL/ATS/VMS reducing integration time by
    50%+; repeatable experimentation framework with regulator/union-aligned
    guardrails; early lighthouse case studies enabling benchmark-driven sales
    and faster procurement.

  character: >-
    Operations leaders at Other Urban Transit Systems who want faster, more
    reliable trips without adding fleet or building new infrastructure.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Unmanaged dwell time that silently erodes reliability.

    - External: Crowding, inconsistent door policies, fare friction, ADA
    boarding coordination, unclear signage/wayfinding, platform layout
    constraints.

    - Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting bunching and complaints, unsure
    which levers work.

    - Philosophical: Riders deserve predictable, safe boarding; staff deserve
    clear, data-backed SOPs.
  guide: >-
    We’ve sat in control rooms and on platforms—dwell drives ripple delays. Our
    AI analyzes APC/AVL/CAD, schedule, and CCTV metadata, with proven 10–25%
    dwell variance reductions in pilots. Safety-first, privacy-compliant, and
    union-aligned.
  plan: >-
    1) Baseline: Ingest APC/AVL/CAD, schedules, incidents, CCTV metadata;
    quantify dwell by stop/route/time.

    2) Diagnose & Playbook: Identify top dwell drivers; simulate scenarios;
    recommend actions (door policy, platform staffing, signage/queueing,
    markings, berth/stop assignment, ADA procedures, dwell targets).

    3) Pilot & Scale: 90-day pilot with dashboards and training; measure ROI;
    codify SOPs; set alerts and continuous monitoring.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a Dwell Audit (2-week rapid assessment).

    - Transitional: Get a free route-level dwell variability snapshot and sample
    playbook.
  success: >-
    - On-time performance +5–15 points; average dwell -10–20%; throughput
    +5–10%.

    - Fewer bunching events and missed connections; safer, calmer platforms;
    improved ADA boarding coordination.

    - Clear, enforceable SOPs; operator stress reduced; capex deferrals through
    better process.
  failure: >-
    Lose 3–20 seconds at every stop, compounding into delays, bunching,
    overtime, safety incidents, rider churn, public scrutiny, and costly fleet
    expansion to mask process issues.
