  problem:
    - >-
      Agents and office managers juggle dozens of contract dates (earnest money,
      inspection, loan approval, appraisal, HOA docs, closing) and miss items
      that delay or kill deals.
    - >-
      Manual chasing of documents from clients, lenders, title/escrow, and co-op
      agents wastes 2–5 hours per transaction and creates inconsistent client
      experiences.
    - >-
      Current transaction management software is feature-heavy, requires long
      onboarding, and is underutilized by teams that only need deadline
      automation and simple updates.
    - >-
      Inconsistent weekly status updates lead to client anxiety, more check‑in
      calls/texts, and lower CSAT/NPS for brokerages.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: incomplete files, missing audit trails, state-specific
      forms, and retention policies create E&O exposure and office headaches.
    - >-
      TC staff turnover and bandwidth constraints create bottlenecks during peak
      seasons, hurting agent productivity and recruiting.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parses executed contracts and addenda (PDF/email) to auto-build a
      critical dates timeline and office-specific checklist.
    - >-
      Automated reminder engine: schedules and sends smart reminders via
      email/SMS to all parties for deadlines, doc requests, and approvals.
    - >-
      Branded weekly status digest to buyers/sellers with what’s done, what’s
      next, and who owes what—reducing inbound “what’s happening?” calls.
    - >-
      One-click compliance view for office managers: missing items, late tasks,
      and audit-ready trails; export/attach to existing transaction system.
    - >-
      Lightweight, no-switchover implementation: integrates with existing tools
      (Google/Outlook Calendar, Gmail/Outlook, DocuSign Rooms, Dotloop,
      SkySlope, TransactionDesk, Follow Up Boss, kvCORE) and MLS/RESO data.
    - >-
      Role-aware access: agents, TCs, lenders, title/escrow get only what they
      need; no heavy training required.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    The fastest way for real estate offices to prevent missed deadlines and keep
    clients informed from offer to close. TC Lite auto-builds critical timelines
    from contracts, chases documents, sends reminders, and delivers branded
    weekly status updates—standing up in under one hour and paying for itself in
    the first month.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing corpus of normalized transaction timelines and outcomes across
    states and brokerages that continuously improves automation accuracy and
