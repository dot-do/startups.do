  problem:
    - >-
      High-volume studios spend 20–40% of production time on first-pass cleanup
      (skin smoothing, dust/scratch, lint, background consistency).
    - >-
      Manual retouching is slow (hours to days) and inconsistent across
      retouchers, hurting time-to-site and brand consistency.
    - >-
      Existing AI tools are point solutions (e.g., background only) and lack
      enterprise workflow, QC, or brand-calibrated presets.
    - >-
      Human BPO vendors require complex briefs, have variable quality, and don’t
      scale elastically for peak seasons.
    - >-
      Stakeholders need measurable SLAs, audit trails, and privacy/compliance
      (SOC 2, VPC) that consumer apps don’t offer.
  solution:
    - >-
      End-to-end pipeline: ingest (API/FTP/plugin) -> brand preset selection ->
      AI batch retouch (skin, dust, background) -> automated QC -> human
      spot-check -> delivery with versioning.
    - >-
      Brand-calibrated presets per client: tone curves, skin smoothing levels by
      skin tone, background whites (e.g., RGB 255 or 245), sharpening, color
      cast correction.
    - >-
      Optional human-in-the-loop for hero shots and edge cases with 2-hour rush
      or 24-hour standard SLAs.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: Capture One/Lightroom/Photoshop plugins, DAM/CDN
      (Bynder, Cloudinary), PIM/OMS webhooks, SFTP hot folders.
    - >-
      Enterprise controls: SOC 2 roadmap, VPC deployment option, access
      controls, audit trails, redaction of sensitive metadata.
    - >-
      Measurable SLAs: 95% of batch images under 60 seconds; 99.5% availability;
      rework under 1.5% per spec; hero polish 24h standard/2h rush.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, brand-calibrated first-pass retouching at scale—background, dust,
    and skin—delivered in minutes with optional on-demand human polish for hero
    shots and enterprise-grade SLAs, privacy, and workflow integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Brand-calibrated presets and automated QC rules tuned on proprietary,
    domain-specific datasets (skin/fabric/product surfaces) combined with
    enterprise workflow integrations and optional VPC deployment. The hybrid AI
    + human-in-the-loop system continuously learns from acceptance/rework
    signals, improving per-brand quality over time.

  character: >-
    High‑volume commercial photo teams (studios, retailers, agencies) who want
    clean, consistent images fast and to reserve human time for hero shots—not
    routine cleanup.
  problem: >-
    External: Thousands of images need skin smoothing, dust removal, and
    background cleanup; manual retouching is slow and inconsistent. Internal:
    Producers and retouchers feel overwhelmed and worry about missing deadlines
    or compromising quality. Philosophical: Creatives should focus on
    storytelling, not repetitive cleanup; speed shouldn’t cost brand
    consistency.
  guide: >-
    We’re a post‑production partner built by high‑volume retouchers and ML
    engineers. We understand deadline pressure, SKU complexity, and brand
    standards. Our AI is tuned for skin, dust, and background cleanup, with
    expert humans available for hero‑shot polish.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload or integrate via API/DAM, 2) Select brand presets and QA
    thresholds, 3) Review, bulk‑approve, and export; escalate select images for
    optional human polish. Agreement: Non‑destructive workflow, secure handling,
    transparent turnaround, per‑image pricing.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 15‑minute demo or start a pilot on your next shoot.
    Transitional: Download sample outputs and a calibration pack to test on your
    files.
  success: >-
    Consistent, on‑brand images delivered on time; first‑pass retouching handled
    automatically; teams regain hours for creative and hero work; fewer
    revisions, smoother handoffs, happier clients, and faster product launches.
  failure: >-
    Backlogs, overtime, missed launches, inconsistent edits across sets,
    burned‑out teams, and lost revenue from delays or reshoots.
