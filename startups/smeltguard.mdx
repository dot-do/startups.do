  problem:
    - >-
      Compliance with 40 CFR Part 63 Subpart RRR (Secondary Aluminum Production)
      requires complex rolling-average calculations (e.g., 3-hr, 24-hr) across
      multiple units, fuels, and operating modes—often done manually in
      spreadsheets, increasing error risk.
    - >-
      CEMS/CPMS/portable analyzer data live in silos (SCADA, data historians,
      USB exports), making it hard to compute valid averages, handle missing
      data, track calibrations, and maintain an auditable chain of custody.
    - >-
      Facilities often detect deviations/exceedances late (days to weeks),
      limiting corrective action windows and increasing the likelihood of formal
      deviations, production slowdowns, and fines.
    - >-
      Preparing Title V Semiannual Monitoring Reports (SMR), Deviation Reports,
      and Annual Compliance Certifications (ACC) takes 20–80 hours per reporting
      cycle per plant and is vulnerable to staff turnover.
    - >-
      Audits are disruptive when evidence is scattered; maintaining 5-year data
      retention, method references, and calibration records is onerous.
    - >-
      Permits and rules change (state-specific conditions, permit renewals, MACT
      updates); keeping calculations and templates current is a constant burden.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge and cloud data aggregation from CEMS, CPMS, SCADA/PLCs, historians
      (OPC UA/DA, Modbus, PI Web API), and portable analyzer uploads (CSV/JSON).
    - >-
      Regulatory rules engine with prebuilt templates for 40 CFR 63 Subpart RRR
      and common Title V permit conditions, including 3-hr/24-hr rolling
      averages, downtime/substitution logic, and startup/shutdown handling.
    - >-
      Real-time exceedance detection, with alerting via SMS/Email/Microsoft
      Teams and recommended corrective actions tied to permit language.
    - >-
      Automated report generation: SMR, Deviation Reports, ACC, and
      facility-specific logs (e.g., baghouse DP logs, afterburner temperature
      compliance) with embedded calculations and attachments (charts,
      calibration proofs).
    - >-
      Audit-ready evidence management: immutable audit trails, calibration/QAQC
      tracking, eSignatures, reviewer workflows, and 5–10 year retention.
    - >-
      Data quality module: data completeness KPI, gap-filling rules, drift
      checks, and daily health summaries to catch issues before reporting
      periods close.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built compliance automation for secondary aluminum: unify
    CEMS/CPMS/portable analyzer data, compute permit- and Subpart RRR–specific
    rolling averages in real time, detect exceedances early, and auto-generate
    ready-for-audit reports with embedded evidence—cutting reporting time by
    70–90% and reducing deviation risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, audit-tested Subpart RRR rule pack with state-specific permit
    templates and connectors tailored to secondary aluminum operations, coupled
    with an evidence locker that preserves data integrity end-to-end. Over time,
    a proprietary dataset of parameter patterns and corrective actions enables
    predictive exceedance prevention that generalist EHS platforms and generic
    CEMS DAS lack.

  character: >-
    Environmental and operations managers at secondary aluminum smelters who
    must continuously prove air‑permit compliance while keeping furnaces running
    on schedule.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented CEMS/portable analyzer data, complex rolling-average
    rules, and manual spreadsheets make exceedance detection and reporting slow
    and error‑prone. Internal: Constant anxiety about missing an event, rework
    before audits, and nights/weekends lost to data wrangling. Philosophical: If
    a plant runs clean, proving compliance should be transparent, timely, and
    effortless.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of federal/state air permits, audits, and
    inspections—and how data gaps can jeopardize production. Built with
    air‑permit engineers and data scientists, our approach aligns calculations
    to permit language and standard methods, providing clear traceability from
    raw data to final reports.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect data sources (CEMS/DAHS, PLC historians, portable
    analyzers). 2) Map permit limits, averaging windows, validity, and
    substitution rules. 3) Validate calculations against sample periods. 4)
    Monitor in real time, alert on exceedances/deviations, and track evidence.
    5) Auto‑generate submittal‑ready reports with audit trails. Agreement: Start
    with a low‑risk pilot on one stack, data security by design, role‑based
    access, and staff training with documented calculation methods.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo and launch a 30‑day pilot on a priority
    stack. Transitional: Download a sample report/calculation methodology and a
    compliance checklist for secondary aluminum operations.
  success: >-
    Confident, continuous compliance; earlier detection of issues; reporting
    time reduced from hours to minutes; clear evidence trails (calibrations,
    uptime, annotations); smoother audits and inspections; less downtime risk;
    more time for process optimization.
  failure: >-
    Missed or late reports, undetected exceedances, inconsistent calculations,
    costly fines or consent actions, forced curtailments, and damaged
    stakeholder trust.
