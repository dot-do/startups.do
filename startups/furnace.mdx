leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fuel spend in reheat furnaces is 10–25% of rolling mill conversion cost;
      setpoints and pacing are tuned manually and drift with grade mix, ambient,
      and upstream variability.
    - >-
      Operators trade energy vs. throughput vs. quality with limited real-time
      decision support, leading to conservative setpoints, over‑soak, higher
      scale loss, and inconsistent exit temperatures.
    - >-
      Legacy Level 2 models are static or poorly maintained; advanced controls
      are OEM‑specific and do not coordinate mill pacing with furnace
      loading/discharge.
    - >-
      Energy price volatility and decarbonization targets require demonstrable
      M&V; mills lack grade/size‑normalized accounting for $/t and CO2/t
      improvements.
    - >-
      Quality risk (under/overheating, non-uniform temperature) and safety
      constraints limit experimentation; teams need a safe, auditable way to
      optimize without increasing cobbles or downgrades.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLC/DCS, historian, QMS/LIMS, and MES; there is no
      unified, actionable KPI view for furnace-mill flow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-deployed AI agent with a physics-informed digital twin and safe
      optimization/RL that recommends or writes bounded setpoint adjustments
      (zone temps, O2, soak time, discharge cadence) and mill pacing targets.
    - >-
      Grade/size-aware heating models using historical heats, billets, and
      LIMS/QMS to keep exit temperature and ΔT uniformity within spec while
      minimizing over‑soak and scale.
    - >-
      Pacing optimizer that synchronizes furnace discharge with stand
      availability and shear/crop rates to reduce idling/empty hearth time and
      line gaps.
    - >-
      Real‑time KPI and M&V dashboard: MMBtu/ton, kWh/ton, exit temperature
      Cp/Cpk, scale loss %, NOx proxy, tons/hour, queue times; normalized by
      grade/size/ambient/load.
    - >-
      Shadow mode, operator-in-the-loop recommendations, and progressive
      closed-loop control with strict safety envelopes, interlocks, and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Utility‑grade measurement & verification (IPMVP Option B/C) with dedicated
      gas flow metering, multivariate regression normalization, and CUSUM
      tracking for verified savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce fuel cost per ton by 5–12% and increase effective throughput 0.5–1.5%
    by safely co-optimizing furnace zone setpoints, discharge timing, and mill
    pacing—without increasing quality defects or cobbles—backed by metered M&V
    and operator‑first controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A safety-certified, OEM-agnostic optimization stack that co-optimizes
    furnace heat curves and mill pacing with verified, meter-based
    savings—trained on a multi-mill dataset and delivered with a proven M&V
