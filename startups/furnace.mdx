  problem:
    - >-
      Over-conservative austenitize/soak recipes waste 8–20% energy per ton due
      to excessive temperatures and dwell times.
    - >-
      Scale loss (oxidation) during austenitize commonly runs 1–3% of part mass;
      poor control leads to rework, machining allowance loss, and scrap.
    - >-
      Inconsistent load size/geometry and furnace condition cause variability in
      hardness and microstructure, forcing wider safety margins and higher
      scrap/rework (1–5%).
    - >-
      Limited metallurgical bandwidth and tribal knowledge make it hard to
      rapidly tune recipes for new grades or part geometries.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance (CQI-9, AMS 2750G, Nadcap) require traceability; most
      plants lack automated, data-backed recipe justification and change
      management.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an edge gateway to ingest furnace data (PLC/SCADA/historian), load
      attributes, alloy grade, and spec targets.
    - >-
      Build a digital twin: physics-informed ML models combining heat transfer,
      austenitization kinetics, CALPHAD-based phase predictions, and
      oxidation/scale growth models.
    - >-
      Optimization engine proposes recipe adjustments (setpoints, ramp rates,
      dwell) per load, subject to metallurgical constraints (e.g., carburization
      risk, grain growth, decarb limits).
    - >-
      Closed-loop or advisory mode: write setpoints to PLC or present operator
      recommendations; capture operator acceptance and results for continuous
      learning.
    - >-
      Quality assurance and compliance: automatic traceability of recipe
      versioning, rationale, and outcomes; SPC dashboards for hardness and
      microstructure; audit-ready reports for CQI-9/Nadcap.
    - >-
      What-if and offline simulation: evaluate new grades/parts pre-production
      to reduce PPAP and trial runs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
