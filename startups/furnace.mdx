  problem:
    - >-
      Specific energy consumption (SEC) is high and variable (typical 4.5–6.5
      GJ/ton; 4.3–6.2 MMBtu/ton), with 5–15% performance gap vs. technical best
      due to drift, leakage, and inconsistent practices.
    - >-
      Operators face trade-offs: hitting target pull without triggering energy
      spikes, foam, seeds/bubbles, or NOx excursions; rules of thumb vary by
      shift.
    - >-
      Limited actionable visibility: plant historians store thousands of tags,
      but real-time heat balance, regenerator efficiency, or true air/gas ratios
      are not directly visible.
    - >-
      Inefficient changeovers/startups: pull changes and product mix shifts
      cause long stabilization, wasted fuel, and higher defect rates.
    - >-
      Inadequate measurement and verification (M&V) for energy projects; hard to
      attribute savings and secure incentives or internal capital.
    - >-
      Skills gap/turnover: loss of furnace domain knowledge leads to suboptimal
      settings and slower troubleshooting.
    - >-
      Emissions and compliance pressure (NOx, CO2/kg glass) require optimization
      without CapEx-heavy rebuilds.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid digital twin: dynamic heat-balance model of furnace, regenerators,
      and boost fused with ML models trained on plant historian and QA data.
    - >-
      Real-time advisor: prescriptive setpoint recommendations (e.g., port fuel
      splits, air/gas ratio, O2 targets, checker/damper adjustments, boost MW
      distribution, doghouse covers, batch depth) to hit energy, pull, and
      quality constraints.
    - >-
      What-if simulations: forecast effect of cullet %, batch moisture, redox
      modifiers, oxygen enrichment, or pull changes on SEC, NOx, and defect
      risk.
    - >-
      Soft sensors and diagnostics: infer unmeasured states (e.g., leakage,
      checker fouling, effective emissivity, melt temp uniformity) to detect
      degradations early.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: baselines normalized for cullet, ambient, product mix,
      and pull; automated savings, CO2, and NOx reporting suitable for internal
      audits and utility incentives.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud deployment: sub-minute inference on-prem with secure sync to
      cloud for model updates; no control-write required (human-in-the-loop).
    - >-
      Operator workflows: ranked actions with confidence intervals, expected
      savings ($/day), and quality risk score; A/B testing and rollback.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce fuel per ton by 5–10% while maintaining target pull and first-quality
    yield, using a hybrid heat-balance + AI advisor that delivers operator-ready
    setpoint actions with predicted impact, guardrails, and auditable
    M&V—without major CapEx.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned hybrid model that translates furnace physics into
    prescriptive, guardrailed actions with quantified impacts and
    uncertainty—validated against multi-plant datasets and packaged with
    auditable M&V. Competitors offer either generic analytics or black-box APC;
    FEPA bridges physics and AI for operator-ready decisions, deployable
    edge-first without control write access.
