  problem:
    - >-
      Cotton yields and input response vary widely within fields (often >30% CV)
      due to soil texture, elevation, water availability, and historical stress,
      but most prescriptions are single-rate or based on 1-year data.
    - >-
      Growers and advisors struggle to build stable management zones from noisy
      picker yield data and inconsistent imagery; year-to-year zones shift,
      eroding trust and ROI.
    - >-
      Manual prescription creation is time-consuming (2–6 hours/field) and
      inconsistent across advisors; VR adoption in cotton lags corn/soy due to
      workflow friction and poor cotton-specific models.
    - >-
      Seed and fertility are among the top variable costs ($120–$250/ac
      combined), leaving margin on the table when rates aren’t matched to
      site-specific potential.
    - >-
      Integrating data across monitors (Deere, Case IH, Ag Leader), soil tests,
      and satellites is technically complex; export formats (ISO-XML, Shapefile)
      often fail at the monitor without validation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion and cleaning for picker yield (module-level
      smoothing, outlier removal), satellite NDVI, soil EC/elevation, and lab
      results.
    - >-
      Zone stability engine: multi-year, multi-layer clustering weighted by
      temporal consistency to produce 3–7 durable management zones per field.
    - >-
      Cotton-tailored variable-rate seeding and fertility prescriptions using
      response-to-environment models and local agronomic rules-of-thumb.
    - >-
      A/B test strips and on-farm trials embedded in prescriptions to quantify
      ROI and continuously recalibrate rates.
    - >-
      Seamless exports to Ops Center, AFS, Ag Leader, Trimble, and ISO-XML; file
      validation to reduce in-field failures.
    - >-
      Advisor dashboard for batch processing, retailer branding, and margin
      tracking; grower portal for map review and approvals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cotton-specific AI that turns messy multi-year data into stable management
    zones and delivers export-ready variable-rate seeding and fertility
    prescriptions that boost lint yield 3–8% and trim input costs 5–15% with
    field-ready files in 48 hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cotton-only stability engine and prescription stack trained on multi-year
    picker yield and embedded trial results across major cotton regions,
    combined with OEM-validated file packaging and retailer/gin partnerships
    that gatekeep access to large acreages.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cotton growers and agronomists who want consistent profit from every acre by
    turning variability into stable zones and actionable variable-rate seeding
    and fertility maps.
  problem: >-
    External: Single-year noise creates unstable zones, leading to
    over/under-application and wasted inputs. Internal: Frustrated by guesswork,
    complex tools, and maps that don’t match reality. Philosophical: Rates
    should be driven by evidence over time—not by averages or hunches.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pain of chasing variability and re-drawing zones every
    season. Authority: Our AI blends multi-year field data into agronomically
    sound, stable management zones used to drive precise VRA prescriptions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect multi-year data (yield, imagery, soil, elevation). 2) Review and
    approve stable management zones. 3) Generate and export variable-rate
    seeding and fertility maps to your equipment.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a field now. Transitional: View sample zones and prescriptions
    or book a 15‑minute fit call.
  success: >-
    Stable zones that persist across seasons, optimized seed and fertilizer
    placement, higher input efficiency and ROI, fewer passes, clearer
    trial/scouting decisions, and audit-ready records you can trust.
  failure: >-
    Another season of flat-rate waste, unstable maps, lower margins, regulatory
    and environmental risk, and decisions driven by guesswork instead of
    multi-year evidence.
