  problem:
    - >-
      Manual RFQ parsing (emails, PDFs, drawings, spreadsheets) consumes 1–3
      hours per quote and delays responses by 1–3 days, reducing win rates.
    - >-
      Inconsistent costing due to tribal knowledge (estimators) and spreadsheet
      drift creates margin leakage (±5–10 pts).
    - >-
      Difficulty modeling fabric yield, cut plans, and sewing/welding routes
      leads to frequent rework and COGS variance vs. actuals.
    - >-
      Material and hardware price volatility (fabrics, webbing, zippers,
      grommets) not reflected in quotes causes margin erosion at order release.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (email, Excel, ERP, CRM) create duplicate entry,
      version control issues, and poor auditability (ISO 9001).
    - >-
      Limited estimator capacity bottlenecks growth; overtime or headcount
      increases are costly and hard to hire for specialty textiles.
    - >-
      Global RFQs (multi-language, units, spec formats) increase error risk and
      slow down processing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Inbound RFQ capture: auto-ingest from email/watch folders/portal; parse
      PDFs, drawings, spreadsheets, images with OCR + vision models.
    - >-
      Entity extraction and normalization: customer, part/spec, quantities,
      incoterms, due dates, compliance flags; unit, currency, and language
      normalization.
    - >-
      Textile-specific BOM builder: fabric yield calculation by roll
      width/length, patterning, seam allowances, nesting; hardware (webbing,
      zippers, grommets) and trims.
    - >-
      Routing and time standards: auto-generate cut/sew/weld/inspect/pack routes
      with machine/labor times based on product type and historicals.
    - >-
      Cost engine: material, labor, overhead, setup, scrap, outside processes,
      freight; applies pricing rules, min lot, breakpoints, and target margin by
      customer/segment.
    - >-
      Lead time estimator: capacity-aware using plant calendars, vendor lead
      times, and WIP; proposes realistic ship dates.
    - >-
      Quote drafting: generates branded, customer-ready PDF/Doc/HTML with terms,
      pricing tiers, and alternates; pushes to CRM/ERP for approval.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: estimator edits with traceable changes;
      auto-learns from approvals/rejections to improve precision.
    - >-
      Compliance and attachments: pulls certificates (FDA/food-grade, ESD,
      MIL-SPEC), testing requirements, and embeds drawings/spec notes.
    - >-
      Analytics and governance: win/loss, cycle time, margin variance, estimator
      performance, model confidence, and audit trails (ISO 9001).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs into costed, customer-ready quotes in minutes with
    textile-specific intelligence—improving speed by 5–10x and protecting
    margins with audit-ready costing and routing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized textile intelligence (yield, routing, compliance) trained on
    real RFQ-to-order histories plus a feedback loop from estimator approvals,
    enabling higher first-pass accuracy and trustworthy costing that generic
    CPQ/RFQ tools cannot match.
