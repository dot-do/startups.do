leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      End-to-end genealogy across reactors, blending, finishing, and packaging
      is not visible in one place; teams stitch together DCS/SCADA historians,
      MES, LIMS, ERP, and warehouse data manually, taking 2–10 days to complete
      an investigation.
    - >-
      Back-blend/rework and bale aggregation obscure ancestry; lot splits/merges
      at finishing and packaging create traceability gaps that broaden recall
      scopes unnecessarily.
    - >-
      Forward/backward trace to customer ship-to, pallet, and bale level is slow
      or impossible, driving broad product holds and recalls that can exceed
      $1–3M per incident including disposal, rework, freight, and customer
      penalties.
    - >-
      Automotive and ISO 9001/IATF 16949 traceability expectations require
      documented, auditable lineage; current evidence packs are time-consuming
      to compile and error-prone.
    - >-
      Data-quality and identity issues (clock drift, inconsistent lot IDs,
      manual logbooks, missing barcodes/RFID scans) prevent reliable linkage
      across systems.
    - >-
      Existing MES/ERP genealogy features miss process-level detail (reactor
      charges, residence time, cleaning cycles), limiting root-cause analysis
      and containment precision.
    - >-
      Plants lack a way to simulate recall scenarios preemptively (what-if on
      suspect RM lots, reactor campaigns, or cleaning failures) to minimize
      scope and customer impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify plant data: prebuilt connectors and a data model that links reactor
      charges, blends, finishing lines, and packaging events to
      bale/pallet/customer shipments.
    - >-
      Automated genealogy builder: graph-based lineage with probabilistic
      entity-resolution to handle splits/merges, back-blends/reworks, and
      partial cleanouts.
    - >-
      Recall simulator: what-if impact analysis by raw-material lots, reactor
      campaigns, equipment, cleaning windows, or property drifts; outputs
      minimum viable containment set.
    - >-
      Operator and quality UI: one-click forward/backward trace to
      bale/pallet/customer; investigation timeline aligning process parameters,
      lab results, and events.
    - >-
      Quality and compliance automation: audit-ready evidence packs,
      e-signatures, and change/audit trails mapped to ISO 9001/IATF 16949
      traceability clauses.
    - >-
      Near-real-time monitoring: streaming updates from historians and scanners;
      configurable alerts for suspect lots, cross-contamination risk, and
      genealogy breaks.
    - >-
      Enterprise integration: APIs to ERP/MES for hold/release, COA attachment,
      FEFO rules in WMS, and notifications to CRM/support systems.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From days to minutes: auditable, bale-to-reactor genealogy and recall
    simulation purpose-built for synthetic rubber—achieving <5-minute
    forward/backward trace, 30–60% recall scope reduction, and 10x faster
    investigations—deployed in 12 weeks and integrated with PI/SCADA, MES, LIMS,
    ERP, and WMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built, time-aware genealogy graph and entity-resolution models
    trained on SR process patterns (reactor campaigns, back-blends, split/merge
    at finishing, bale/pallet hierarchies), plus a recall minimization engine
    and prebuilt connectors to dominant OT/IT systems—enabling a 12-week go-live
    with proven KPIs that generic MES/ERP or horizontal analytics platforms
    struggle to match.

  character: >-
    Operations, quality, and supply chain leaders at synthetic rubber plants
    (NAICS 325212) who want instant, end-to-end batch traceability to protect
    throughput, compliance, and customers.
  problem: >-
    Data is siloed across reactors, blending, finishing, and packaging. When
    issues arise, teams spend days stitching logs and spreadsheets—delaying
    root-cause, widening recall scope, risking downtime, penalties, and audit
    findings.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run plants and built manufacturing data systems—so we get the pressure
    of recalls and customer audits. Our AI maps batch genealogy across
    DCS/MES/LIMS/ERP with secure, audit-ready records and vendor-neutral
    integrations (PI/AVEVA, Aspen, Honeywell, SAP, Oracle, LIMS).
  plan: >-
    1) Connect plant data sources. 2) Auto-build lot/batch genealogy across unit
    operations. 3) Investigate and contain via dashboards, alerts, and
    workflows. Pilot in 30 days; scale site-wide in 90.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute discovery to scope a pilot; request a sample genealogy
    map and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Resolve root-cause in minutes, not days; limit recalls to only affected
    lots; pass customer and ISO/IATF traceability audits; cut scrap/rework;
    protect on-time shipments and brand trust.
  failure: >-
    Without this, investigations drag on, recalls broaden unnecessarily,
    production holds grow costly, auditors flag traceability gaps, and customers
    lose confidence.
