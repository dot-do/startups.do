  vision: "Auditable bale-to-reactor genealogy in minutes, not days."
  mission: "Transform synthetic rubber traceability with AI-powered genealogy graphs."
  purpose: "Minimize recall scope and investigation time for synthetic rubber manufacturers."
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "End-to-end genealogy across reactors, blending, finishing, and packaging is not visible in one place; teams stitch together DCS/SCADA historians, MES, LIMS, ERP, and warehouse data manually, taking 2–10 days to complete an investigation."
    - "Back-blend/rework and bale aggregation obscure ancestry; lot splits/merges at finishing and packaging create traceability gaps that broaden recall scopes unnecessarily."
    - "Forward/backward trace to customer ship-to, pallet, and bale level is slow or impossible, driving broad product holds and recalls that can exceed $1–3M per incident including disposal, rework, freight, and customer penalties."
    - "Automotive and ISO 9001/IATF 16949 traceability expectations require documented, auditable lineage; current evidence packs are time-consuming to compile and error-prone."
    - "Data-quality and identity issues (clock drift, inconsistent lot IDs, manual logbooks, missing barcodes/RFID scans) prevent reliable linkage across systems."
    - "Existing MES/ERP genealogy features miss process-level detail (reactor charges, residence time, cleaning cycles), limiting root-cause analysis and containment precision."
    - "Plants lack a way to simulate recall scenarios preemptively (what-if on suspect RM lots, reactor campaigns, or cleaning failures) to minimize scope and customer impact."
  solution:
    - "Unify plant data: prebuilt connectors and a data model that links reactor charges, blends, finishing lines, and packaging events to bale/pallet/customer shipments."
    - "Automated genealogy builder: graph-based lineage with probabilistic entity-resolution to handle splits/merges, back-blends/reworks, and partial cleanouts."
    - "Recall simulator: what-if impact analysis by raw-material lots, reactor campaigns, equipment, cleaning windows, or property drifts; outputs minimum viable containment set."
    - "Operator and quality UI: one-click forward/backward trace to bale/pallet/customer; investigation timeline aligning process parameters, lab results, and events."
    - "Quality and compliance automation: audit-ready evidence packs, e-signatures, and change/audit trails mapped to ISO 9001/IATF 16949 traceability clauses."
    - "Near-real-time monitoring: streaming updates from historians and scanners; configurable alerts for suspect lots, cross-contamination risk, and genealogy breaks."
    - "Enterprise integration: APIs to ERP/MES for hold/release, COA attachment, FEFO rules in WMS, and notifications to CRM/support systems."
  uniqueValueProp: "From days to minutes: auditable, bale-to-reactor genealogy and recall simulation purpose-built for synthetic rubber—achieving <5-minute forward/backward trace, 30–60% recall scope reduction, and 10x faster investigations—deployed in 12 weeks and integrated with PI/SCADA, MES, LIMS, ERP, and WMS."
  unfairAdvantage: "A purpose-built, time-aware genealogy graph and entity-resolution models trained on SR process patterns (reactor campaigns, back-blends, split/merge at finishing, bale/pallet hierarchies), plus a recall minimization engine and prebuilt connectors to dominant OT/IT systems—enabling a 12-week go-live with proven KPIs that generic MES/ERP or horizontal analytics platforms struggle to match."
  customerSegments:
    - "Large and mid-sized synthetic rubber manufacturers (NAICS 325212) producing SBR, BR, NBR, EPDM, IIR/CIIR, CR, and SBCs."
    - "Integrated petrochemical companies with elastomers business units."
    - "Toll/contract producers of custom elastomers."
    - "Primary buyers: VP/Director of Manufacturing, Plant Manager, Quality Director, Head of Technical Service, OT/IT Architecture Lead, Regulatory/Compliance Manager."
  channels:
    - "Direct enterprise sales to VP Manufacturing/Quality and Plant Managers at NA/EU SR producers; pilot-led sales motion with 12-week proofs."
    - "Alliances with OT/IT ecosystem: AVEVA/OSIsoft, Honeywell, AspenTech, SAP, and LIMS partners; list on partner marketplaces."
    - "System integrators specializing in petrochemicals for deployment and change management; rev-share for co-selling."
    - "Account-based marketing focused on ~120 global SR targets; tailored business cases using public production data and recall case studies."
    - "Industry presence: IISRP membership, ACS Rubber Division, ASTM elastomer committees; speak at traceability/quality forums and contribute best-practice guides."
    - "Content and enablement: white papers on recall minimization, webinars with a lighthouse plant, and ROI calculators tied to production volumes."
    - "Land-and-expand: start at one plant/line, add finishing/packaging modules, then roll out multi-plant governance and enterprise analytics."
  revenueStreams:
    - "Annual subscription per site (tiered by number of lines/throughput/data volume): Core $150k, Plus $250k, Enterprise $400k+ ARR."
    - "Implementation/onboarding per site: $150k–$400k one-time, depending on system landscape and data quality."
    - "Professional services: data cleansing, custom connectors, change management, and validation—$180–$250/hour or fixed-price packages."
    - "Premium support/SLA (24x7, dedicated TAM): 15% of ARR uplift."
    - "Training and certification for plant/IT teams: $10k–$50k per cohort."
    - "Add-on modules: Recall Simulator Pro, Supplier RM Risk Scoring, Customer Portal integration ($50k–$150k ARR each)."
  costStructure:
    - "R&D: data engineering, graph/ML, connectors, and security (largest fixed cost)."
    - "Implementation delivery: field engineers, solution architects, and site travel."
    - "Cloud infrastructure and observability (or on-prem packaging/edge appliances) sized to data rates; target COGS ≤20% of ARR."
    - "Partner fees and rev-share (10–20%) for SI/channel deals; marketplace listing fees."
    - "Sales and marketing: enterprise AEs, SEs, ABM, events, and content production."
    - "Compliance and certifications: SOC 2 Type II, penetration tests, IEC 62443-aligned assessments."
    - "Liability insurance, customer support, and customer success for renewals/expansion."
    - "Licenses for graph databases/analytics where applicable."
