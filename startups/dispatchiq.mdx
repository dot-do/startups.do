leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High deadhead miles (often 25–40% of total miles) inflate fuel, tolls, and
      vehicle wear costs.
    - >-
      Manual dispatching cannot scale during peaks (airport surges, events),
      causing missed SLAs and overtime.
    - >-
      Rules-based auto-assign in legacy dispatch tools ignores complex
      constraints (driver hours, vehicle class, client preferences, traffic,
      flight delays).
    - >-
      Overtime and duty-hour violations expose operators to compliance risk and
      margin erosion.
    - >-
      Limited forecasting and lack of back-to-back ride linking reduce driver
      utilization and revenue per vehicle.
    - >-
      Dispatchers lack explainable recommendations and what-if tools, causing
      low trust in automation.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (dispatch, telematics, flight, weather) makes real-time
      optimization difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven auto-assignment ranks and assigns optimal driver-ride matches in
      real time, minimizing deadhead, overtime risk, and SLA breaches.
    - >-
      Back-to-back ride linking to reduce empty repositioning and increase
      revenue miles per hour.
    - >-
      Duty-hour and overtime-aware scheduling with configurable labor rules by
      jurisdiction and union policy.
    - >-
      Proactive re-optimization for flight delays, traffic disruptions, weather,
      and last-minute bookings.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if simulator for dispatchers to compare
      assignment plans before committing.
    - >-
      Demand forecasting by zone/time to pre-position vehicles and suggest
      farm-out/in decisions.
    - >-
      Explainable recommendations with transparent scoring (ETA, deadhead, hours
      remaining, vehicle class, client preferences).
    - >-
      Seamless integrations with major dispatch, telematics, maps/traffic, and
      flight data sources for unified decisioning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut deadhead miles by 20–30%, lift on-time SLA to ≥98.5%, and auto-assign
    60–90% of rides with an explainable, dispatcher-in-the-loop AI engine
    purpose-built for limousine operations, integrated into your existing
    dispatch stack within 30 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A limo-specific, explainable optimization engine trained on pre-booked plus
    on-demand patterns, with deep integrations into leading dispatch platforms
