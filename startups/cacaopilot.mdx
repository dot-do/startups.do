    production and procurement plans.
  targetUsers:
    - Demand Planner
    - Supply Chain Manager
    - Operations Manager
  triggers:
    - New sales data posted

      features)
    - Reconcile across hierarchy (SKU→brand→region)
    - 'Convert forecast to constrained MPS (capacity, lot sizes)'

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High demand volatility tied to holidays and promotions (Valentine’s,
      Easter, Halloween, Winter holidays) causes 20–50% week-to-week swings,
      overwhelming Excel-based planning.
    - >-
      SKU and channel proliferation (retail, club, convenience, eCom/DTC, food
      service) creates forecast dilution; most firms see 25–45% MAPE at
      SKU‑channel‑week level.
    - >-
      Finite capacity constraints (tempering, molding, enrobing, cooling
      tunnels, packaging lines) and allergen changeovers (nuts, milk) make many
      plans infeasible when generated by generic MRP.
    - >-
      Long and variable lead times for cocoa beans, cocoa butter, milk powder,
      sugar, and specialty inclusions lead to expedites and stockouts; planners
      lack integrated demand-to-procurement visibility.
    - >-
      Allergen cleaning and tooling availability (molds, wrappers, dies) are not
      modeled, inflating changeovers 10–20% and idling capacity.
    - >-
      Promotional lifts and retailer events are poorly captured (sell-in vs
      sell-out disconnect), leading to 3–7 point service-level misses and
      chargebacks.
    - >-
      Yield losses, rework, and shelf-life/bloom risks are not modeled in plans;
      typical scrap/obsolescence at 3–6% of COGS.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP (SAP/Oracle/Microsoft), WMS, MES/line data, and
      retail POS prevents near real-time plan updates.
    - >-
      S&OP to S&OE handoff is slow; planners spend 8–12 hours/week preparing
      plans and scenario analyses instead of optimizing them.
    - >-
      Procurement lacks forward visibility to beans/blends by
      origin/certification (Rainforest/UTZ/Fairtrade), causing suboptimal
      hedging and premium usage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand sensing and forecasting at SKU x channel x week using hierarchical
      models with holiday/promo/event calendars and retailer POS sell-out.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity production planning that models
      tempering/molding/enrobing/cooling/packaging resources, allergen cleaning
      matrices, mold/tool constraints, minimum run sizes, and shelf-life.
    - >-
      Procurement planning that explodes demand to cocoa beans/butter/powder,
      sugar, milk, inclusions, and packaging with lead times, MOQs, supplier
      calendars, and hedging windows.
    - >-
      Scenario simulation co‑pilot to test promotions, cannibalization, pricing,
      cocoa futures movements, and capacity additions; presents service level,
      margin, inventory, and changeover trade-offs.
    - >-
      Automated recommendations to release production schedules and POs, with
      planner-in-the-loop approvals and audit trails.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box connectors to SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics/Business
      Central, NetSuite; EDI and retailer portals; Shopify/Amazon for DTC; and
      MES/line data for actuals.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: model drift monitoring, bias detection (e.g., promo
      overshoot), and feature store tuned for confectionery seasonality.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From forecast to feasible plan: CacaoPilot turns noisy SKU/channel demand
    into high-accuracy forecasts and auto-generates a finite-capacity,
    allergen-aware weekly production and procurement plan—cutting MAPE 20–40%,
    raising service levels 3–5 points, and reducing changeovers, waste, and
    expedites within 6–8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A confectionery-specific planning stack—pre-trained models, allergen-aware
    changeover optimization, mold/tool libraries, and cocoa blend/certification
    procurement logic—delivering go-live in 6–8 weeks and measurable ROI in 90
    days; reinforced by anonymized industry benchmarks that improve accuracy and
    sequencing over time.
