  title: Metadata Enrichment & MLC/PRO Registration Prep
  description: >-
    Enriches work/recording metadata and outputs CWR/DDEX or portal-ready files
    for registrations.
  targetUsers:
    - Publishers
    - Catalog admins
  triggers:
    - New release ingestion
    - Pre-MLC/PRO registration batch
  inputs:
    - 'Work and recording lists (titles, ISWC/ISRC if available)'
    - Writer/publisher splits and identifiers
    - 'Release info (dates, territories)'
  steps:
    - Normalize names and map aliases; validate identifiers
    - Lookup ISRC/ISWC via public sources and heuristics
    - 'Validate splits, rights shares, and roles'
    - Generate CWR and DDEX files; PRO-specific CSVs
    - Human QC of edge cases
    - Upload via portal/SFTP or deliver to client
  tools:
    - MusicBrainz/Discogs APIs
    - The MLC Public Search (web)
    - OpenAI (entity normalization)
    - DDEX/CWR libraries
    - Playwright for portal upload
    - Google Sheets
  outputs:
    - Validated metadata master
    - CWR/DDEX packages
    - Registration upload receipts
  pricingModel:
    - Per work/recording fee
    - Batch pricing
    - Monthly retainer for ongoing enrichment

  risks:
    - APIs rate-limited/incomplete

    - Portal terms on automation
  dependencies:

    - 'Writer/Publisher IDs (IPI/CAE, ISNI)'
    - SFTP/portal credentials
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High rejection/exception rates on CWR submissions to PROs due to
      incomplete/incorrect fields (e.g., missing/invalid IPI/CAE, role codes,
      share math, work title conflicts) delaying monetization by weeks or
      months.
    - >-
      Incomplete mapping between compositions (ISWC) and recordings (ISRC)
      prevents claiming at MLC and other mechanical/neighboring rights agencies.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-heavy workflows limit throughput (typical teams
      process 100–500 works/day/FTE) and create version control errors for
      catalogs >10k works.
    - >-
      Large volumes of unmatched royalties (“black box”) at MLC and DSPs persist
      due to inconsistent metadata across sources (writers, labels,
      distributors).
    - >-
      Lack of standardized, validated exports (CWR, DDEX MWN/RIN, portal CSVs)
      causes duplicate registrations, conflicts, and rejections across
      societies.
    - >-
      Poor visibility into validation rules per PRO/territory leads to avoidable
      resubmissions and compliance risks.
    - >-
      Post-registration monitoring is fragmented; exceptions, conflicts, and new
      usages aren’t looped back to fix root-cause metadata.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Connect to catalogs (CSV/SFTP/API), CMS tools (e.g.,
      Synchtank/Vistex), distributor exports, and PRO/MLC portals.
    - >-
      Normalize: Standardize writer/publisher entities, roles, IP names, and
      territories; auto-clean titles and aliases; deduplicate works.
    - >-
      Enrich: AI entity resolution links ISWC⇄ISRC, fetches/validates IPIs,
      assigns/validates role codes and shares; suggests missing data with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Validate: Pre-flight rule engine runs society-specific validation (CWR
      v3.x, DDEX MWN/RIN, MLC portal schemas) to catch rejections before
      submission.
    - >-
      Export: Generate compliant CWR, DDEX (MWN/RIN), and MLC/PRO portal-ready
      CSV/Excel; push via SFTP/API where supported.
    - >-
      Monitor: Track submission outcomes, exceptions, conflicts, and usage;
      auto-create fix tickets; continuously improve via feedback loop.
    - >-
      Govern: Audit trails, versioning, and approval workflows; sandbox vs.
      production environments; rights and territory controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Register faster with fewer rejections. CWRight AI enriches and validates
    work/recording metadata, then outputs CWR/DDEX/portal-ready files that pass
    society checks, recover unmatched royalties, and scale registrations 3–5x
    per FTE.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning validator trained on multi-society
    rejection/exception outcomes plus a rights graph that links ISWC⇄ISRC across
    disparate sources. This feedback loop and dataset (error codes, acceptance
    heuristics, alias clusters, share/role norms by society) compound over time
    and are difficult to replicate. Additionally, turnkey CWR/DDEX exporters
    with pre-flight simulations reduce first-pass rejections to best-in-class
    levels.
  customerSegments:

    Music publishers and rights admins who need complete, accurate metadata to
    register works/recordings with the MLC and PROs—without spreadsheet chaos.
  problem: >-
    External: Incomplete or inconsistent data triggers rejections, conflicts,
    and unmatched works at MLC/PROs. Internal: Teams waste hours chasing splits,
    identifiers, and versions. Philosophical: Creators deserve timely, accurate
    royalties; bad data shouldn’t block payment.

    We’re metadata ops specialists with deep music data standards expertise. Our
    AI is trained on CWR/DDEX rules and industry identifiers (ISWC, ISRC,
    IPI/CAE, ISNI). Secure, compliant, and audit-ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your catalog (CSV/CWR/DDEX/DB/portals) or upload files. 2) AI
    cleans, deduplicates, enriches, validates, and links works-to-recordings;
    flags conflicts. 3) Export CWR or DDEX (e.g., MWL/RIN) and portal-ready
    files for MLC/PRO submissions, or push via API; monitor and resolve
    exceptions.

    Clean, complete, compliant registrations; fewer rejections and holds; faster
    matches at MLC/PROs; more captured royalties; less manual work; searchable
    audit trail and ongoing health alerts.
  failure: >-
    Data gaps persist, causing rejections, conflicts, black-box holds, delayed
    payments, and royalty leakage—while teams stay stuck in spreadsheets.
