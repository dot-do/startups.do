    remoteOnLaptop: 0.9
    modelCapability: 0.8
    overall: 0.85
  risks:
    - Misread drawings/specs leading to cost errors
    - Out-of-date material/freight prices
    - Liability for bid accuracy without SME review
  dependencies:
    - Access to historical rates and standards
    - Vendor price lists for materials/heads
    - Template library for quotes
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ packages (100–1,000+ pages incl. drawings/specs) take 6–24 hours each
      to interpret; quote backlogs cause missed bid deadlines and lost revenue.
    - >-
      High error risk in extracting critical requirements (API 650/620, ASME
      VIII, plate grade/thickness, NDE, coatings, nozzles, wind/seismic);
      mistakes erode margin or trigger costly change orders.
    - >-
      Estimating depends on tribal knowledge (cutting/forming/welding hours,
      fit-up yields, shop vs field erection) that walks out the door with senior
      estimators.
    - >-
      Manual, duplicate data entry across email, PDF, ERP, and Excel; poor
      traceability of assumptions and basis-of-quote.
    - >-
      Lead-time commitments are guesswork without capacity-aware scheduling;
      overpromising causes expediting costs and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Price volatility (plate steel, coatings, freight) makes static cost
      libraries stale; updating them is manual and slow.
    - >-
      Customers are increasingly demanding itemized quotes with clear
      assumptions and exceptions, increasing preparation time.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ parser extracts dimensions, materials, weld types/length, NDE,
      coatings, nozzles, accessories, design code sections, tests, and delivery
      location from PDFs/drawings/specs.
    - >-
      Parametric cost model calibrated to each shop’s processes (cutting,
      forming, welding, fit-up, blasting/painting, hydrotest, field erection) to
      generate BOM, route times, and labor/equipment hours.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing engine: pulls current plate indices (e.g.,
      CRU/MetalMiner), coatings, and freight; applies target margins by
      category/risk.
    - >-
      Lead-time engine tied to rough-cut capacity (critical workcenters,
      subcontract steps) to propose credible ship/install dates.
    - >-
      Assumption builder: auto-generates inclusions/exclusions, clarifications,
      and alternates; flags missing/ambiguous RFQ requirements and code
      conflicts.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP/CPQ/CRM (Epicor, Infor, JobBOSS, Salesforce/HubSpot),
      design tools (COMPRESS/PV Elite) to import design parameters and export
      quotes/BOMs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review with confidence scoring, change tracking, and
      audit trail from RFQ to awarded job and post-mortem actuals.
    - >-
      Security: SOC 2 roadmap, customer-dedicated VPC or on-prem connector;
      role-based access and data residency options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs into accurate, itemized quotes with capacity-aware lead times in
    hours, not days—grounded in your shop’s actual costs and standards, with
    full traceability of assumptions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Shop-specific estimation twin: a continuously learning model calibrated to
    each plant’s routings, yields, and vendor base, enriched by anonymized
    industry benchmarks and standards-aware extraction libraries for API 650/620
    and ASME VIII—creating accuracy and speed competitors without domain data
    cannot match.

  character: >-
    Estimators, sales engineers, and ops leaders at heavy‑gauge metal tank
    manufacturers (NAICS 332420) who want to respond to complex RFQs fast with
    accurate, defensible, itemized quotes and reliable lead times to win
    profitable work.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Bloated, disjointed RFQ packages (drawings, specs, emails) and
    manual takeoffs

    - External: Time‑consuming parsing; missed requirements (materials, NDE,
    coatings, code stamps); inconsistent assumptions; capacity‑blind lead times;
    rework

    - Internal: Stress over errors and late quotes; fear of underbidding;
    burnout

    - Philosophical: Skilled manufacturers shouldn’t lose bids because paperwork
    is harder than the fabrication
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the scramble of last‑minute RFQs and the risk of hidden
    requirements buried in multi‑doc packages

    - Authority: Built for heavy‑gauge tanks; AI tuned for technical docs and
    drawings; human‑in‑the‑loop review; security‑first; integrates with common
    ERP/CPQ; clear audit trail from quote lines back to source pages
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Upload RFQ package (PDFs, drawings, BOMs)
      2) AI extracts scope (materials, welds, NDE, coatings, routing) and produces itemized pricing, lead time, and assumptions
      3) You review, adjust margins/lead time, export to quote/ERP, and send
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Start with a pilot using past RFQs
      - Transparent, usage‑based pricing; cancel anytime
      - Your RFQ data stays private; encrypted at rest and in transit
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct CTA: Book a 20‑minute demo; Start a pilot on 5 historical RFQs

    - Transitional CTA: Download a sample itemized quote and ROI calculator; RFQ
    parsing checklist
  success: |-
    - Quotes generated in minutes, not days
    - Higher win rates via faster responses and clear assumptions
    - Protected margins with accurate takeoffs and standardized cost drivers
    - Capacity‑aware lead times aligned to shop schedule
    - Traceable: every line item linked to source pages
    - Consistent quoting across estimators; faster onboarding
    - More bids submitted with the same team
  failure: |-
    - Slow, inconsistent quotes and missed line items erode margins
    - Lost bids to faster competitors
    - Costly change orders and backcharges from overlooked requirements
    - Estimator overtime and burnout; damaged reputation with buyers
