    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Clouds or similar neighboring fields confuse boundaries

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual field boundary mapping for rice is slow and error‑prone (typical
      GPS walk error ±5–15% area, 30–90 minutes per field) causing
      subsidy/insurance disputes and delayed payments.
    - >-
      Cloud cover during planting and vegetative stages makes optical imagery
      unreliable; verification windows are short (often <3 weeks).
    - >-
      Counterparties (insurers, subsidy programs, contractors) demand
      audit‑ready documentation; most farmers/co-ops lack standardized, accepted
      reports.
    - >-
      Service providers and co-ops need high‑volume, low‑cost, fast turnaround
      (<48 hours) boundary validation to schedule inputs/mechanization
      efficiently.
    - >-
      Fragmented smallholder parcels (0.2–2.0 ha typical in Asia) inflate
      verification costs using drones or on‑ground surveyors.
    - >-
      Lack of unified APIs and compliance templates leads to repetitive data
      entry and high operational overhead for agtech platforms and insurers.
    - >-
      Disputes over measured vs declared area lead to payment clawbacks and
      trust loss; acceptance/rejection decisions are inconsistent without
      standardized certificates.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI boundary extraction using multi‑temporal Sentinel‑1 SAR (cloud‑proof)
      fused with Sentinel‑2/Planet imagery; rice‑specific models tuned for
      puddling/flooded fields.
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑loop QA to reach target area error <2% MAE and IoU ≥0.85 for
      90% of fields; escalation workflow for complex parcels.
    - >-
      Certificate pack: printable PDF with QR code verification,
      GeoJSON/Shapefile/KML exports, metadata (imagery dates, methods,
      accuracy), and counterparty‑specific forms.
    - >-
      Mobile/web intake: farmer consent, simple pin‑drop or rough sketch,
      optional geotagged photos; offline support and WhatsApp bot for
      low‑connectivity regions.
    - >-
      Batch processing and API endpoints for insurers/platforms; webhook
      callbacks with SLA timestamps and status codes.
    - >-
      Change detection and season tagging (pre‑sowing to harvest) to ensure
      season‑correct area and identify merged/split fields.
    - >-
      Tamper‑evident certificate registry (hashing) and immutable audit log to
      support disputes; redress SLA within 72 hours.
    - >-
      Operations playbook: peak‑season surge capacity, prioritization queues,
      and rush option (<12 hours) for time‑sensitive jobs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Certified, audit‑ready rice field boundaries and area delivered in 24–48
    hours via AI and SAR+optical fusion, with human QC,
    regulator/insurer‑approved templates, API integration, and pricing that
    scales to smallholders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rice‑specialized SAR+optical fusion models and QA workflows tuned for
    flooded/puddled conditions; acceptance MoUs with insurers/regulators and
    pre‑approved certificate templates; a verified certificate registry with QR
    checks; multilingual farmer intake via WhatsApp; and a growing proprietary

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rice farm owners, cooperatives, and service providers who need verified
    field boundaries and acreage to qualify for input subsidies, insure crops,
    and contract services—without costly field visits.
  problem: >-
    External: outdated or inconsistent field maps, bund shifts, and seasonal
    flooding distort acreage; Internal: uncertainty risks lost subsidies,
    disputes, and delays; Philosophical: farmers should be paid and protected
    based on accurate, transparent area.
  guide: >-
    We understand paddy dynamics and the paperwork pressure. Our geospatial and
    agronomy team applies satellite imagery, AI boundary extraction, and QA
    checks to deliver audit-ready evidence for programs, lenders, and insurers.
  plan: >-
    1) Provide field locations (draw/KML/CSV). 2) We extract and validate
    boundaries from recent imagery with seasonal/historical cross-checks. 3)
    Receive the Area Certification Pack: map overlays, geospatial files, and a
    standardized acreage report for submission.
  callToAction: Start a pilot and request a sample Area Certification Pack.
  success: >-
    On-time subsidy filings, fewer claim disputes, precise input planning,
    transparent contracting, reduced site visits, and faster payments—backed by
    documented, defensible acreage.
  failure: >-
    Without it: missed subsidies, rejected claims, boundary disputes, compliance
    risk, wasted fieldwork, and stalled contracts.
