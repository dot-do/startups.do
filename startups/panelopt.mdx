  problem:
    - >-
      Panelization and step-and-repeat currently take 30–90 minutes per job for
      skilled CAM engineers; in high-mix shops this consumes 20–35% of daily CAM
      time.
    - >-
      Panel utilization varies by 2–7 percentage points between operators/tools,
      causing avoidable laminate waste and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Manual trade-offs across routing vs V-score, tab density, rail dimensions,
      coupon placement, fiducials, and AOI/drill constraints are inconsistent
      and error-prone.
    - >-
      High-mix, low-volume fabs struggle to pool small orders effectively,
      leading to under-filled panels and longer queues.
    - >-
      Coupon and fiducial compliance to IPC and customer-specific requirements
      requires tribal knowledge; mistakes trigger re-spins and delivery delays.
    - >-
      Inadequate rail design and depanelization strategy cause breakage and
      downstream handling issues, increasing scrap 0.3–1.5%.
    - >-
      Suboptimal drill/rout path planning and tool changes add 5–15% machine
      time per panel.
    - >-
      Iterating with customers to approve panel drawings (rail size, coupon
      type, serialization) causes 1–3 extra back-and-forth cycles and slips TAT
      by 4–12 hours.
    - >-
      Operator scarcity: senior CAM engineers are hard to hire/retain;
      onboarding to panelization best practices takes 6–12 months.
    - >-
      Existing CAM modules are deterministic with limited plant-specific
      learning; they don’t adapt to real yield/throughput feedback or dynamic
      line capabilities.
    - >-
      Different press/LDI formats and panel sizes across lines require multiple
      templates; maintaining them across shifts/sites leads to drift and
      confusion.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven, multi-objective panel layout optimizer that balances
      utilization, manufacturability, and throughput using plant-specific
      constraints (press sizes, LDI windows, drill/rout limits, AOI formats).
    - >-
      Automated selection/placement of rails, break-off tabs, mouse-bites,
      fiducials, and coupons with rules mapped to IPC and customer
      specifications; generates dimensioned panel drawings for approval.
    - >-
      Strategy engine to choose V-score vs tab-route (or hybrid), optimize tab
      density and positions for minimal stress and downstream depanelization
      reliability.
    - >-
      Order pooling and schedule-aware step-and-repeat: groups compatible jobs
      to fill panels while respecting delivery dates, material types, and copper
      thickness constraints.
    - >-
      Toolpath-aware drill/rout optimization to reduce air moves and tool
      changes; estimates machine time and flags bottlenecks before release.
    - >-
      Risk scoring: predicts warp/bow and rout stress risks based on board size,
      stack-up, copper balance, and historical plant data; recommends
      rail/coupon adjustments.
    - >-
      One-click outputs in ODB++/IPC-2581/Gerber X2, including NC drill/rout,
      V-score maps, serialization, panel drawings (PDF/DXF), and BOM of
      rails/coupons.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingests AOI/AFX defects, scrap causes, machine logs,
      and operator adjustments to refine future panelization automatically.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem or private cloud (VPC), with connectors to
      UcamX/Genesis/InCAM, CAM350, Valor NPI, ERP/MES for job metadata.
    - >-
      What-if simulator and ROI estimator: compares candidate panels on
      utilization, cycle time, and predicted yield; maintains audit trail for
      customer/regulatory reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Boost PCB panel utilization and throughput with a learning, constraint-aware
    optimizer that encodes your plant’s real capabilities. Achieve 3–8% better
    material usage, 20–50% faster CAM panelization, and measurable reductions in
    rework and scrap—delivered as an integrated, auditable, one-click flow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A closed-loop, plant-specific optimizer trained on real outcomes
    (AOI/scrap/machine time) plus a deep rules library that encodes IPC and
    customer-specific constraints. The combination of solver + learned risk
    models, OEM CAM integrations, and anonymized benchmarking makes results hard
    to replicate with generic CAM modules or in-house scripts.
