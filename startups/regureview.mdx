  problem:
    - >-
      Supplement reviews frequently contain disease-treatment claims (e.g.,
      “cured my arthritis”) that violate FTC/FDA/ASA guidelines, exposing brands
      to warning letters, platform takedowns, and lawsuits.
    - >-
      Manual moderation and response is slow and expensive; many brands cannot
      review every comment across Amazon, Shopify, and third-party sites within
      a 24–48 hour SLA.
    - >-
      Teams lack domain-specific guidance on compliant response language,
      resulting in inconsistent tone and regulatory risk.
    - >-
      Valuable product insights (side effects, efficacy, taste, packaging
      defects, dosage confusion) are buried in unstructured text and not
      systematically captured or prioritized.
    - >-
      Existing general-purpose moderation tools miss supplement-specific edge
      cases (structure/function vs disease claims, implied claims, testimonials)
      and lack audit trails acceptable to compliance teams.
    - >-
      Multilingual and multi-market compliance (US/EU/UK/AU) adds complexity
      that outstrips internal expertise.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated moderation engine trained on supplement-specific risk taxonomy
      (disease claims, implied claims, medical advice, dosage/contraindications,
      adverse events, age/condition targeting, competitor disparagement,
      profanity/PII).
    - >-
      Compliant auto-response generator using brand voice and pre-approved
      templates, with jurisdiction-specific guidance and optional
      human-in-the-loop approval.
    - >-
      Insight mining and topic analytics: attribute-level sentiment (efficacy,
      side effects, taste, value, packaging, shipping), trend detection,
      churn/risk signals, and prioritized backlog of product/label improvements.
    - >-
      Multi-channel connectors (Shopify/Okendo/Judge.me/Yotpo/Bazaarvoice,
      Amazon Seller Central, Google/Apple, Trustpilot) with centralized workflow
      and SLAs.
    - >-
      Compliance audit trail: immutable logs of decisions, model versions,
      reviewers, response texts, and regulatory rule references; exportable for
      internal audits and external counsel.
    - >-
      Adverse event detection and escalation: automatic routing to QA/RA with
      redaction, deduping, and follow-up tasks; configurable SOP checklists.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific AI that keeps supplement brands compliant and responsive at
    scale: auto-moderate risky claims, auto-respond with pre-approved compliant
    language, and mine actionable product insights—backed by a regulator-ready
    audit trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, regulator-aligned claims taxonomy and labeled dataset for
    supplements, combined with jurisdiction-aware templates and an auditable
    decision engine tailored to RA/Legal workflows—difficult for generalist
    moderation tools to replicate. Early partnerships with review platforms and
    regulatory advisors reinforce defensibility.
