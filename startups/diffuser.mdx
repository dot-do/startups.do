  problem:
    - >-
      Diffuser operation is often run with conservative setpoints to avoid sugar
      losses, leading to suboptimal extraction efficiency and higher
      energy/water consumption.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time, trustworthy estimates of sugar losses in pulp
      and true extraction efficiency; lab results are delayed by hours and mass
      balances are noisy.
    - >-
      Complex trade-offs (residence time vs. temperature vs. wash water vs.
      cossette quality) are difficult to optimize continuously across shifts and
      varying beet quality.
    - >-
      High steam and water usage in extraction elevates downstream evaporation
      costs and wastewater load.
    - >-
      Unplanned stoppages due to fouling, channeling, or bed instability
      increase sugar losses and downtime.
    - >-
      Existing APC/PID/rule-based logic is not tailored to changing campaign
      conditions (beet maturity, dirt load, temperature) and cannot learn from
      historical patterns across campaigns.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-deployed, physics-informed ML models that estimate real-time sugar
      loss in pulp (% on beet) and extraction efficiency using soft sensors and
      reconciled mass/energy balances.
    - >-
      Advisory control engine that continuously recommends setpoints (wash water
      flow, temperature profile, residence time/bed level, recycle ratios) to
      maximize net sugar recovery subject to energy/water and quality
      constraints.
    - >-
      Digital twin of the diffuser (transfer, leaching, and thermal models)
      calibrated to each plant and beet quality; includes what-if simulation.
    - >-
      Fouling/channeling risk predictor to avoid chokes, optimize screenings,
      and schedule cleans.
    - >-
      Operator cockpit with KPIs, recommended actions, explainability (why this
      move now), and campaign benchmarking across shifts/plants.
    - >-
      Secure OT/IT integration with DCS/PLC (OPC UA/DA), historian
      (PI/AVEVA/Honeywell PHD), and LIMS; closed-loop option after advisory
      prove-out.
    - >-
      Change management program: playbooks, training, A/B testing, and
      incentive-aligned performance reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase sugar extraction efficiency by 0.2–0.6 percentage points while
    reducing steam 2–5% and diffuser water 5–15% through physics-informed AI

    ROI within a single campaign with performance guarantees.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
