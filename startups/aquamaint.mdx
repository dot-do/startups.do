leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on fillers, blow molders, and compressors causes 3–8%
      production loss per plant, equating to 12–32 hours/month. With typical
      downtime cost of $1.5k–$12k/hour (size/throughput dependent), plants lose
      $18k–$384k/month.
    - >-
      Early-stage mechanical and pneumatic issues (bearing wear, gearmesh
      defects, HP air leaks, dryer malfunctions) are missed until failure;
      current PM routes and calendar-based maintenance create unnecessary
      parts/labor and still miss latent failures.
    - >-
      Limited in-house PdM expertise and siloed data (PLC/SCADA, CMMS,
      compressor telemetry) impede timely decisions. Technicians receive alert
      fatigue or vague alarms lacking root cause and action steps.
    - >-
      Compressors are single points of failure for PET blow molding; a single HP
      compressor trip can idle the entire line. Energy waste from degraded
      compressors (3–10%) goes undetected, increasing cost/CO2.
    - >-
      Quality and safety risks from torque drift in cappers, temperature
      excursions, or air purity issues lead to scrap and potential recalls;
      these events are not predicted early.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge data collection from vibration (ISO 10816/20816 ranges), motor
      current, high-pressure air (30–40 bar) and low-pressure air, and
      temperature on critical components: filler carousels, cappers, conveyors,
      blow wheel drives, preform ovens, HP compressors/dryers.
    - >-
      Domain-specific AI models: order-tracked spectral analysis for
      variable-speed assets; gearmesh/sideband detection; kurtosis/crest factor
      trending; MCSA for motors; pressure ripple and leak analytics; RUL
      estimation by failure mode.
    - >-
      Contextualization with PLC tags (rate, speed, product), CMMS work orders,
      and compressor control data to reduce false positives and quantify
      production impact in $/hour.
    - >-
      Actionable workflows: alert with root-cause hypothesis, severity,
      detection lead time, recommended corrective actions, parts list, and
      estimated production risk; one-click CMMS work order creation.
    - >-
      Rapid pilot program (8–12 weeks): baseline, model tuning, weekly
      reliability reviews, and ROI report; scale by line after hitting jointly
      agreed KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut unplanned downtime on fillers, blow molders, and compressors by 25–50%
    within 90 days using multi-sensor AI tuned to bottled water lines. Payback
    in under 6 months with guaranteed ROI or fee credit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific failure signature library and labeled dataset for bottled
    water lines (fillers, blow molders, compressors) plus OEM PLC adapters yield
    higher alert precision with faster deployment than generalist PdM tools.
    Coupled with workflow automation to CMMS and ROI-backed pilots, this creates
    switching costs and defensibility.
