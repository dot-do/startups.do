  problem:
    - Manual export classification (ECCN/USML/HTS) is slow and error‑prone: 1–3 hours per new item and weeks to clear complex assemblies, creating shipment delays and WIP buildup.
    - Misclassification risk is high: inconsistent interpretations of CCL/USML categories, ambiguous specs in tech data/CAD, and version drift lead to costly rework, seizure, or penalties.
    - Recipient screening is not embedded where work happens (CAD/PLM/Email), causing process gaps (e.g., sharing controlled tech data with foreign nationals) and audit exposure.
    - Legacy GTM tools are rules‑based, tuned for logistics, and weak on engineering artifacts (drawings, BOMs, CAD features, test data); compliance teams still rely on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.
    - Audits are painful: missing item‑level audit trails, uncontrolled policy exceptions, and poor linkages between classification decisions, justifications, and released revisions.
    - Small/mid manufacturers lack in‑house legal/ITAR expertise, yet face the same EAR/ITAR/OFAC obligations as primes and Tier‑1s, with limited budgets and staff.
  solution:
    - AI models map parts, assemblies, and tech data to ECCN/USML/HTS with confidence scores and human‑in‑the‑loop review.
    - Inline screening of recipients and organizations (OFAC/BIS/EU/etc.) in Email (Outlook/Gmail) and PLM/ERP workflows; blocks or routes approvals based on policy.
    - Document/CAD risk scanning detects export‑controlled keywords, performance parameters, USML indicators, DFARS/ITAR markings, foreign person access, and geolocation risks before data is shared.
    - Policy engine ties classifications to jurisdiction, license requirements, end‑use/end‑user checks, exemptions/exceptions, and shipment routing; generates license determination memos.
    - Workflow and audit layer captures evidence, reviewer decisions, and links to released revisions, change orders, and shipments; API-first connectors to PLM/ERP/TMS.
    - Backfile/bulk classification service to cleanse legacy item masters and attach justifications to each part, BOM, and drawing.
  uniqueValueProp: Turn engineering artifacts into compliant shipments. ClearExport AI classifies items (ECCN/USML/HTS), screens recipients, and flags export risks directly inside CAD/PLM/Email—cutting cycle time by 70–90%, achieving >90% classification precision on covered categories, and providing a clean, auditable trail from drawing release to export filing.
  unfairAdvantage: A purpose-built, audited dataset linking item features from CAD/BOMs to ECCN/USML/HTS outcomes—enriched with citations and prior advisory opinions—drives explainable AI decisions and faster auditor acceptance; deeply embedded CAD/PLM/email integrations create workflow lock‑in; and an expanding cross‑customer classification library (with privacy-preserving aggregation) accelerates accuracy and onboarding over time.
