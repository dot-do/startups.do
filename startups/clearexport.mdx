  problem:
    - >-
      Manual export classification (ECCN/USML/HTS) is slow and error‑prone: 1–3
      hours per new item and weeks to clear complex assemblies, creating
      shipment delays and WIP buildup.
    - >-
      Misclassification risk is high: inconsistent interpretations of CCL/USML
      categories, ambiguous specs in tech data/CAD, and version drift lead to
      costly rework, seizure, or penalties.
    - >-
      Recipient screening is not embedded where work happens (CAD/PLM/Email),
      causing process gaps (e.g., sharing controlled tech data with foreign
      nationals) and audit exposure.
    - >-
      Legacy GTM tools are rules‑based, tuned for logistics, and weak on
      engineering artifacts (drawings, BOMs, CAD features, test data);
      compliance teams still rely on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Audits are painful: missing item‑level audit trails, uncontrolled policy
      exceptions, and poor linkages between classification decisions,
      justifications, and released revisions.
    - >-
      Small/mid manufacturers lack in‑house legal/ITAR expertise, yet face the
      same EAR/ITAR/OFAC obligations as primes and Tier‑1s, with limited budgets
      and staff.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI models map parts, assemblies, and tech data to ECCN/USML/HTS with
      confidence scores and human‑in‑the‑loop review.
    - >-
      Inline screening of recipients and organizations (OFAC/BIS/EU/etc.) in
      Email (Outlook/Gmail) and PLM/ERP workflows; blocks or routes approvals
      based on policy.
    - >-
      Document/CAD risk scanning detects export‑controlled keywords, performance
      parameters, USML indicators, DFARS/ITAR markings, foreign person access,
      and geolocation risks before data is shared.
    - >-
      Policy engine ties classifications to jurisdiction, license requirements,
      end‑use/end‑user checks, exemptions/exceptions, and shipment routing;
      generates license determination memos.
    - >-
      Workflow and audit layer captures evidence, reviewer decisions, and links
      to released revisions, change orders, and shipments; API-first connectors
      to PLM/ERP/TMS.
    - >-
      Backfile/bulk classification service to cleanse legacy item masters and
      attach justifications to each part, BOM, and drawing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn engineering artifacts into compliant shipments. ClearExport AI
    classifies items (ECCN/USML/HTS), screens recipients, and flags export risks
    directly inside CAD/PLM/Email—cutting cycle time by 70–90%, achieving >90%
    classification precision on covered categories, and providing a clean,
    auditable trail from drawing release to export filing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built, audited dataset linking item features from CAD/BOMs to
    ECCN/USML/HTS outcomes—enriched with citations and prior advisory
    opinions—drives explainable AI decisions and faster auditor acceptance;
    deeply embedded CAD/PLM/email integrations create workflow lock‑in; and an
    expanding cross‑customer classification library (with privacy-preserving
    aggregation) accelerates accuracy and onboarding over time.
