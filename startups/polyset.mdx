  problem:
    - >-
      High variability in CTQs (Mooney viscosity, Tg, bound styrene, molecular
      weight distribution) leads to 3–8% off-spec or downgraded product and
      frequent rework/scrap.
    - >-
      Trial-and-error lab cycles during grade transitions or recipe changes take
      2–5 days with 3–7 iterations, delaying shipments and consuming monomers,
      solvents, and lab capacity.
    - >-
      Feedstock variability (styrene/butadiene purity, inhibitor content,
      solvent composition, water hardness, emulsifier lot differences) and
      ambient conditions drift impact kinetics unpredictably.
    - >-
      Limited use of historical data: rich data in DCS/historian/LIMS is
      underutilized for predictive setpoint/recipe optimization; models live in
      spreadsheets or siloed APC projects.
    - >-
      Safety and EHS constraints limit exploration; operators are reluctant to
      change setpoints without quantified risk within PHA-approved envelopes.
    - >-
      Knowledge drain and shift-to-shift variability cause inconsistent
      responses to disturbances and slow onboarding of new engineers/operators.
    - >-
      Integrating polymerization know-how (kinetic mechanisms) with
      plant-specific idiosyncrasies (reactor fouling, RTD, heat transfer) is
      hard with generic ML tools.
    - >-
      Change management/MOC burden makes it difficult to validate and audit
      process changes, slowing continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-first onboarding: connectors to DCS/historians (OSIsoft PI, Aspen
      IP.21), LIMS (LabWare, LabVantage), and MES to assemble
      per-batch/continuous run datasets with CTQs and process variables.
    - >-
      Hybrid kinetic-ML models per grade family: mechanistic polymerization
      kinetics and heat/mass transfer blended with data-driven corrections for
      plant-specific effects (fouling, RTD, impurities).
    - >-
      Uncertainty-aware CTQ prediction: forecast Mooney, Tg, bound styrene with
      prediction intervals; flag data regime gaps; trigger active-learning
      experiments when needed.
    - >-
      Constrained optimization engine: Bayesian/MPC-style recommender proposes
      safe setpoint trajectories (temperature profile,
      initiator/emulsifier/chain-transfer feeds, monomer ratios, agitation) and
      recipe adjustments within validated safety and equipment limits.
    - >-
      Safety guardrails by design: recommendations restricted to
      PHA/MOC-approved envelopes with interlocks (pressure/temp, oxygen ppm,
      inhibitor minima, maximum polymer solids) and automatic checks for
      cumulative risk.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot UI: scenario simulator with expected CTQ shift, risk
      bands, time-to-target; natural language rationale; one-click MOC record
      creation with full audit trail.
    - >-
      DoE assistant: suggests minimal, safe lab or plant trials to close model
      blind spots or accelerate new grade qualification; calculates expected
      information gain.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: tracks off-spec reduction, lab cycle savings,
      energy/solvent savings, and throughput gains; integrates with finance to
      quantify verified savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit CTQs first time with quantified safety. PolySet Advisor recommends
    auditable, PHA-compliant setpoint and recipe tweaks that cut lab cycles
    30–50%, reduce off-spec 20–40%, and improve throughput 2–5% for emulsion and
    solution polymerization lines.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built hybrid models for rubber polymerization with embedded safety
    envelopes and uncertainty quantification, plus a validated PoV playbook that

    Process and manufacturing engineers at synthetic rubber plants (NAICS
    325212) responsible for hitting CTQs while maintaining safety, throughput,
    and cost.
  problem: >-
    External: Variable feedstocks and complex kinetics push Mooney, Tg, and
    bound styrene off target. Internal: Trial-and-error lab cycles, lost time,
    and firefighting. Philosophical: Hitting CTQs shouldn’t require guesswork or
    risk.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure to keep trains full and specs tight
    without compromising safety. Authority: Built by polymer scientists and
    APC/ML engineers; proven on emulsion and solution lines; safety, compliance,
    and operating limits encoded as hard constraints with transparent, auditable
    recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Discover: connect historian/LIMS, define CTQs, limits, and guardrails. 2)
    Calibrate: learn from historical runs + mechanistic rules; simulate safe
    perturbations; propose candidate recipes/setpoints. 3) Deploy: run in shadow
    mode, enable sign-off workflow, then operator-facing recommendations with
    interlocks; continuous learning and weekly review. Commitment: never propose
    outside approved safety and compliance boundaries—you control approvals.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and data readiness check. Transitional:
    Run a no-risk pilot on one grade/reactor this quarter.
  success: >-
    First-time-right batches; fewer lab iterations; tighter CTQ distributions;
    less off-grade and rework; faster grade changes; lower raw/energy per ton;
    captured know-how; traceable decisions; calmer, safer operations.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means off-spec lots, scrap and rework, schedule slips, higher
    energy/monomer use, tribal-knowledge churn, audit headaches, and customer
    complaints.
