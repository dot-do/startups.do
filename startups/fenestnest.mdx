  problem:
    - >-
      Excess material waste: 8–20% scrap on aluminum profiles and 5–12% on
      glass/sheet due to manual or siloed nesting and fragmented job batching.
    - >-
      High changeover and setup time: 20–40 minutes per saw/laser/glass-table
      changeover; 4–8 changeovers per shift; 2–3 hours/day lost capacity.
    - >-
      Data re-entry and errors: BOMs from configurators/ERP are manually
      reworked for machines; 1–3% miscuts/rework; labels not synchronized with
      nests.
    - >-
      Poor remnant utilization: 30–60% of remnants never reused due to lack of
      tracking/constraints, increasing raw material purchases by 2–5%.
    - >-
      Scheduling conflicts: rush jobs disrupt nests; no multi-objective
      optimization to balance due dates, material yield, and machine time.
    - >-
      Limited traceability: inconsistent part labeling/serialization leads to
      wrong-piece at assembly/field, 0.5–1.5% return/repair rate.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer that simultaneously minimizes material scrap and
      changeover time while meeting due dates and machine constraints across
      profiles, sheet, and glass.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud architecture: secure on-prem edge agent connects
      machines/labelers; cloud service performs heavy optimization; offline
      fallback with cached recipes.
    - >-
      Native connectors to LogiKal, Soft Tech V6, A+W, FeneVision,
      SchüCal/ReynaPro exports; ERP/MES connectors (SAP, Microsoft Dynamics 365,
      NetSuite, Odoo) to import BOMs, orders, and route parameters.
    - >-
      Certified post-processors for common machines (e.g., Elumatec/Emmegi/FOM
      saws; Bystronic/Trumpf lasers; Lisec/Bottero glass tables) generating
      NC/DXF/G-code/CSV/BTX as required.
    - >-
      Dynamic remnant library with constraint-aware reuse (min length/width,
      grain/miter limits, coating orientation for glass, expiry flags) and
      barcode tracking.
    - >-
      Changeover-aware sequencing engine that batches by profile, tool, coating,
      color/finish, or thickness to reduce tool swaps, blade head changes, or
      re-zeroing.
    - >-
      One-click label generation with GS1/QR codes, station routing, and
      assembly/barcoding rules; integrates with Zebra/Brady/TSC printers and
      scanners.
    - >-
      Shop-floor dashboards: live queue, OEE aids, what-if simulation for rush
      orders; KPI reporting on yield, minutes saved, and material $ saved.
    - >-
      Role-based APIs and audit logs; SOC 2-ready controls; regional data
      residency options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, multi-material cut-list and nesting optimizer purpose-built for
    fenestration that reduces scrap by 10–18% and changeover time by 25–40%,
    boosts throughput 10–15%, and exports certified machine-ready files and
    labels integrated with your configurator, ERP/MES, and shop-floor
    printers—delivering payback in under 90 days for typical mid-sized plants.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A fenestration-specific, changeover-aware optimization engine trained on
    cross-material data (profiles, sheet, glass) plus a certified library of
    post-processors and configurator connectors. This combination delivers
    measurable gains in both material yield and runtime efficiency that
    general-purpose nesting tools and single-material OEM software rarely
    achieve. Early access to partner OEM machine specs and system-house profile
    libraries further raises switching costs.
