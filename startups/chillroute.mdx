  problem:
    - >-
      Under-filled trailers (typical 70–80% cube/weight utilization) drive
      avoidable miles and fuel spend.
    - >-
      Manual planning (spreadsheets/tribal knowledge) takes 2–6 hours/day per
      planner and doesn’t scale with demand spikes or driver shortages.
    - >-
      Temperature compliance risk: mixed temp bands, poor sequencing, and long
      dwell cause excursions, claims, and rejected loads.
    - >-
      Inflexible routing around delivery windows and Hours-of-Service (HOS)
      creates late deliveries, detention, and overtime.
    - >-
      Load legality issues (axle/weight distribution) and dock constraints cause
      rework at load time.
    - >-
      Siloed systems: WMS, TMS, ELD/reefer telemetry, and appointment systems
      don’t sync; picks and BOLs are error-prone.
    - >-
      Limited auditability for FSMA Sanitary Transportation rule; incomplete
      chain-of-custody and temperature documentation.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven multi-temperature load builder that respects product temperature
      bands (fresh/chilled/frozen), shelf-life/kill-date rules, and
      incompatibilities.
    - >-
      Route optimization that enforces delivery windows, HOS (FMCSA), driver
      breaks, dock constraints, and service times while minimizing miles/cost.
    - >-
      Weight, axle, and cube-aware packing/stacking with load sequencing for
      stop order and temperature integrity (pre-cool and door-open
      minimization).
    - >-
      Automated export of wave/pick lists to WMS and digital BOL generation with
      commodity, lot, and temperature setpoints.
    - >-
      Closed-loop monitoring: ingest reefer/ELD telemetry and flag risk;
      re-optimize when exceptions occur (late truck, appointment changes).
    - >-
      FSMA/HACCP audit trail: chain-of-custody, setpoints, continuous temp
      traces, corrective actions, and shipper-carrier communication logs.
    - >-
      Fast onboarding: connectors and templates for item masters, orders,
      appointments, equipment, and location constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plan temperature-compliant, legal, and profitable poultry routes in
    minutes—not hours—boost trailer utilization by 8–15%, reduce miles by 5–12%,
    cut temperature excursions by 50%+, and export ready-to-execute picks and
    digital BOLs with a complete FSMA audit trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built optimization for poultry-specific constraints (temp bands,
    shelf-life/kill-date rules, cross-contamination, multi-compartment reefers)
    plus closed-loop telemetry re-optimization and FSMA audit trails. Pre-built
    integrations with leading WMS/TMS/ELD/reefer systems shorten time-to-value.
    Growing proprietary dataset of temperature-risk profiles and service-time
    distributions by customer/location improves plans over time.

    Ops managers and dispatchers at poultry merchant wholesalers who want every
    load safe, on time, and cost‑efficient.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Heat, time, and complexity threaten margins and reputation.

    - External: Multi‑temp SKUs, limited reefer zones, tight delivery windows,
    HOS rules, dock constraints, and paperwork.

    - Internal: Manual planning is stressful and error‑prone; fear of spoilage,
    chargebacks, and audits.

    - Philosophical: Shipping safe food shouldn’t require guesswork—every plan
    should protect the cold chain and the bottom line.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure of keeping product cold and customers
    happy under tight windows and strict rules.

    - Authority: AI that encodes FSMA/HACCP constraints and logistics best
    practices; industry‑grade optimization; integrates with WMS/TMS; exports
    picks and BOLs.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect orders, SKUs, temp zones, fleet, and constraints. 2)
    Auto‑build temperature‑compliant loads and HOS‑safe routes that respect
    windows and capacity. 3) Export picks, BOLs, and driver instructions via
    API/EDI/CSV.

    - Agreement: Start with a pilot, validate service and utilization, then
    scale with confidence.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Schedule a demo or start a pilot.
    - Transitional: Request sample output and an ROI/coverage checklist.
  success: >-
    Full, compliant trailers; on‑time deliveries; fewer miles and touches;
    reduced spoilage and chargebacks; faster planning; documented cold‑chain
    compliance; clean BOLs and pick lists; happier customers and drivers.
  failure: >-
    Spoiled or rejected loads, chargebacks, missed windows, HOS violations,
    wasted capacity, overtime planning, audit findings, and lost accounts.
