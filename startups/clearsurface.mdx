  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or periodic visual inspection misses small or transient defects
      (gels, fisheyes, scratches, contaminants), leading to scrap, rework, and
      customer claims. Typical manual detection recall is 50–70% for >100 μm
      defects at line speeds >100 m/min.
    - >-
      Existing surface inspection systems are expensive, complex to maintain,
      and often tuned for laminated/packaging film; they struggle with
      low-contrast defects on thick or matte unlaminated materials.
    - >-
      High false positives and poor calibration waste operator time and can slow
      lines; plants need <0.5 false positives per m² at 200 m/min to avoid alarm
      fatigue.
    - >-
      Limited traceability: many plants lack roll maps and defect classification
      tied to MES/ERP, hindering root cause analysis and continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Integration pain: connecting cameras, lighting, PLCs (OPC
      UA/EtherNet-IP/Profinet), and historian systems is time-consuming and
      risky to uptime.
    - >-
      Offline QA lacks standardized, comparable analytics; lab images aren’t
      leveraged to improve line models.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge AI inspection node connects to line-scan or area cameras and
      industrial lighting, performing real-time detection/classification of
      gels, fisheyes, scratches, and contaminants.
    - >-
      Auto-calibration workflow for different materials, finishes (gloss/matte),
      and thicknesses; supports recipe-based model switches tied to line grade
      changes.
    - >-
      Roll/Sheet map generation with severity, size, and density metrics; alarms
      via PLC for automatic screen change, winder splice, or line speed
      adjustment.
    - >-
      Offline analysis tool for lab images to validate defects, label data, and
      continuously improve on-line models via MLOps pipeline.
    - >-
      Open integrations to PLC (OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, Modbus TCP, Profinet),
      MES/ERP (REST/OData), and historians (OSIsoft PI, Ignition), plus
      exportable QC certificates.
    - >-
      Analytics layer correlating defects with process tags (melt temp, screw
      speed, die pressure, resin lot) to identify root-cause patterns and
      recommend interventions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Low-latency, vision-based defect detection purpose-built for unlaminated
    film and sheet that delivers >95% recall on gels/fisheyes >100 μm at up to
    300 m/min with <0.5 false positives per m², integrates directly with line
    PLCs/MES, and produces actionable roll maps and root-cause insights—at
    40–60% lower total cost of ownership than legacy systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specialized model library for unlaminated materials (matte/thick
    sheets, low-contrast defects) trained on a proprietary dataset and synthetic
    generator, plus proven PLC/MES integrations enabling closed-loop control.
    This combination delivers measurable recall/precision at high speeds that
    general-purpose vision systems struggle to match, with faster commissioning
    due to pre-validated imaging stacks and per-grade model templates.

    Quality, production, and process leaders at unlaminated plastics film and
    sheet plants who must reliably catch gels, fisheyes, scratches, and
    contaminants before they ship.
  problem: >-
    Villain: Fast-moving, low-contrast surface defects that hide in plain sight.
    External: Manual/offline checks miss gels, fisheyes, scratches, and
    contaminants; results vary by shift; lab checks are slow. Internal: Pressure
    to cut scrap and complaints without adding headcount; frustration from
    firefighting defects after the fact. Philosophical: World-class film
    shouldn’t be rejected because defects go unseen.

    images; integrates with PLC/MES/SCADA; secure on‑prem or private cloud;
    references available.
  plan: >-
    Process (3 steps): 1) Assess your line, samples, and KPIs. 2) Pilot on one
    line or with offline images; label and calibrate thresholds. 3) Deploy with
    real-time alerts, dashboards, and reports; train operators and QA.
    Agreement: Clear SLA, your data stays yours, no lock-in hardware, safety and
    privacy compliant.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute line assessment and start a pilot.

    Real-time detection and classification of gels, fisheyes, scratches, and
    contaminants; fewer complaints and chargebacks; lower scrap and rework;
    higher OEE; faster release decisions; audit-ready traceability; confident,
    empowered operators.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing missed defects, costly scrap and rework, returns and lost capacity,
    stressed teams, eroded customer trust, and margin leakage.
