  steps:
    - 'Extract required attributes (architecture, scale, access, power)'
    - Search and compile candidates via Maps/Places and public databases
    - 'Estimate logistics (parking, permit links, travel time)'

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual location scouting takes 20–60 hours per project and requires travel
      before creative buy-in.
    - >-
      Sun/light windows are hard to predict precisely for target dates, causing
      schedule shifts and overtime when scenes fall into shade or backlight.
    - >-
      Information is fragmented across Google Maps, photo apps, emails, PDFs,
      and permitting sites; teams lose context and repeat work.
    - >-
      Remote producers and clients need visual proof (angles, shadows,
      access/parking) quickly to approve budgets and lock schedules.
    - >-
      Existing sun apps are built for stills/photography and don’t combine
      cinematic constraints (camera FOV, lensing, blocking) with access and
      permits.
    - >-
      Studios demand predictable, auditable planning; scouts spend time
      compiling PDFs and maps rather than scouting creatively.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload brief/script sides, references, and target shoot dates; AI extracts
      visual cues (architecture, vibe, elevation, water, interior/exterior) and
      constraints (crew size, vehicles).
    - >-
      AI generates a shortlist of candidate locations with images, map pins,
      access notes, and precise sun/shadow windows for those dates/times,
      factoring lens FOV and orientation.
    - >-
      Interactive 3D sun path overlays on map/street-level imagery; simulate
      blocking, time-of-day shifts, and lensing to validate light.
    - >-
      Auto-compile logistics: parking, load-in paths, nearest power, noise/air
      traffic risk, restroom proximity, and estimated permit authority/lead
      times.
    - >-
      One-click exports: deck-ready PDFs, shareable web links for approvals, and
      CSV/KML for call sheets and maps.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: mark approvals and rejects; model learns project style to
      improve next suggestions and build a private location knowledge base.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From script to shortlist in hours: AI-curated locations with verified
    sun/light windows, access notes, and permit context—exportable to your call
    sheet and map.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Film-specific location knowledge graph that fuses creative intent,
    sun/shadow windows, and access/permitting heuristics—continuously improved
    by opt-in, differentially private feedback from active productions. Over
    time, this yields higher relevancy and fewer on-site surprises than generic
    map or photography apps.
