  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts of critical spare parts cause instrument downtime, missed SLAs,
      and revenue loss for service contracts (typical fill rates 88–93% with
      frequent expedites).
    - >-
      Overstock on long-tail, intermittent-demand parts ties up working capital
      and leads to obsolescence write-offs (5–12% annually on EOL parts).
    - >-
      Lead time volatility (supplier, customs, hazmat) and multi-echelon
      networks (global DCs, regional hubs, FSLs) make manual planning
      ineffective.
    - >-
      New product introductions and supersessions break historical continuity,
      degrading forecast accuracy for 12–24 months.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP, FSM, PLM, and 3PL systems blocks a unified
      view of demand, install base, SLAs, and inventory.
    - >-
      Generic ERP planning modules are not tuned for service-parts intermittency
      and SLA-driven stocking by region and tier.
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand forecasting purpose-built for intermittent service parts using a
      hybrid stack (Croston/SBA/TSB + probabilistic ML + hierarchical
      reconciliation) at SKU × region × SLA tier.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon inventory optimization that jointly sets reorder points,
      safety stocks, and order quantities across DC → regional hub → FSL,
      constrained by lead-time variability and service targets.
    - >-
      SLA-aware policies that translate contract terms (e.g., 24h/48h/Next
      Flight Out) into availability targets and time-to-fill objectives by
      geography.
    - >-
      New-product and supersession handling using BOM/PLM linkages, transfer
      learning, and attribute-based analogs to reduce cold-start error.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if simulation for policy, lead-time, and
      supplier risk changes; ROI comparison across service levels.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration that pushes policies into ERP/MRP (SAP, Oracle)
      and monitors adherence, exceptions, and realized outcomes.
    - >-
      Optional IoT/telemetry ingestion (utilization, error codes, MTBF) to
      create early demand signals and dynamic stocking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase parts availability to 97–99% while reducing inventory 15–30% within
    6–12 months by forecasting SKU × region × SLA and optimizing multi-echelon
    safety stocks, reorder points, and purchase policies tailored to analytical
    instrument demand patterns.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A lab-instrument-specific parts ontology and federated learning approach
    that leverages cross-OEM patterns without exposing proprietary data,
    combined with SLA-tier-aware multi-echelon optimization and prebuilt
    integrations to the lab OEM tech stack. Early-warning signals from service
    tickets and telemetry are tied to demand lifts, delivering measurable gains
    faster than generic planning tools.

  character: >-
    Service and supply chain leaders at analytical lab instrument manufacturers
    who want the right spare part in the right region at the right time to meet
    SLAs—without excess inventory, expediting, or obsolescence.
  problem: >-
    - External: Intermittent, regionalized demand; long lead times; fragmented
    min/max settings; SLA penalties; costly expedites; obsolescence risk.

    - Internal: Planners stuck in spreadsheets and guesswork; low confidence
    justifying buffers by region and SLA; constant firefighting with field
    service.

    - Philosophical: Critical science and diagnostics shouldn’t pause because
    spare parts planning is opaque and reactive.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand high-mix, low-volume service parts with strict
    SLAs, global installed bases, and regulatory scrutiny.

    - Authority: Built by domain experts using proven, explainable forecasting
    for intermittent demand; secure and audit-ready; integrates with major
    ERPs/CMMS to operationalize policy.
  plan: >-
    - Data connect: Ingest service orders/RMAs, parts hierarchy/BOM, install
    base, lead times, regions, and SLAs/customer tiers.

    - Model & simulate: Forecast demand and set reorder points/safety stocks by
    region and SLA; scenario test service levels vs. working capital.

    - Operationalize: Push min/max to ERP; automate reorder alerts and weekly
    exceptions; dashboard KPIs; training, governance, and a low-risk 6–8 week
    pilot with clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a 30-minute scoping call; start a data-readiness
    assessment; launch a pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the ROI model and KPI checklist; view a sample
    dashboard; read the implementation playbook.
  success: |-
    - Hit target SLAs with higher part availability by region.
    - Fewer stockouts, rush orders, and expedites.
    - Lower working capital and obsolescence.
    - Standardized, auditable min/max policy across regions and customer tiers.
    - More productive planners and transparent forecasts.
    - Happier customers and stronger service revenue.
  failure: |-
