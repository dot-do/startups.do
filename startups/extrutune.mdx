  problem:
    - >-
      Extrusion lines run below potential due to trial-and-error setpoint
      tuning, leading to excess scrap (2–8%), off-spec thickness/haze, and
      inconsistent tensile performance.
    - >-
      Blend and additive decisions are made with partial data, causing higher
      resin cost per ton and variability across shifts and lines.
    - >-
      Design of Experiments (DOE) is underused: manual, slow (weeks), and not
      integrated with production constraints, quality targets, or cost models.
    - >-
      Existing analytics are generic dashboards (not prescriptive), lack
      polymer-specific physics, and rarely integrate coextrusion layer models,
      die bolt profiles, or line-rate constraints.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal: best “recipes” and golden batches aren’t captured or
      transferred, driving long changeover and start-up wastes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-plus-cloud platform that ingests PLC/SCADA/Historian (e.g., PI,
      Ignition), lab/LIMS data, and ERP cost data to build live multi-objective
      models for thickness, haze, tensile and cost.
    - >-
      Physics-informed + data-driven modeling: coextrusion layer stack, rheology
      (MFR/MI, density), melt temp/pressure, die bolt profile, haul-off/chill
      roll dynamics.
    - >-
      Automated DOE assistant: proposes minimal, safe experiments respecting
      quality/throughput constraints, schedules trials, and quantifies impact
      with SPC-integrated analysis.
    - >-
      Real-time prescriptive guidance: recommends setpoints and blend
      percentages to hit specs; provides what-if simulations and uncertainty
      bounds; supports closed-loop or operator-in-the-loop modes.
    - >-
      Recipe governance: versioned “golden recipes,” changeover playbooks, and
      audit trails with role-based access and e-signatures.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap, resin cost, and time-to-spec with a polymer-savvy AI that
    designs and runs DOEs, learns from your lines, and recommends optimal
    setpoints and blends to meet thickness, haze, tensile targets at the lowest
    cost—payback typically under one quarter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific modeling stack combining physics-informed coextrusion and
    die-bolt/CD profile response with active-learning DOE, prebuilt industrial
    connectors, and a growing proprietary dataset of recipe–quality–cost
    outcomes that general AutoML or generic analytics tools lack.

  character: >-
    Process engineers, quality leaders, and production managers in unlaminated
    plastics film and sheet (non-packaging) manufacturing who must consistently
    hit thickness, haze, tensile, and cost targets.
  problem: >-
    Resin variability and multivariate line interactions make recipes hard to
    tune; trial-and-error DOEs are slow and costly, causing scrap, off-spec
    rolls, and missed margins. They want confident, data-driven setpoints and
    blends without guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand extrusion complexity and plant realities. The Extrusion Recipe
    Tuning and DOE Assistant combines historical runs with physics-aware machine
    learning to predict outcomes, propose optimal setpoints and blends, and
    validate them with focused DOEs—backed by domain experts and secure
    integration with SCADA/LIMS.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your data (runs, resin properties, specs) and baseline
    performance. 2) Generate a targeted DOE and virtual screen to narrow
    options; run minimal trials. 3) Deploy optimized setpoints and blends;
    monitor drift and auto-refresh recommendations.
  callToAction: Start a two-week pilot or book a 30-minute discovery call.
  success: >-
    Hit spec windows for thickness, haze, and tensile with fewer trials; cut
    scrap 20-40%, reduce resin cost 3-8%, shorten changeovers, speed DOEs 5x,
    and capture institutional know-how.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting with tribal knowledge, wasting resin and time on unstable
    lines, risking off-spec shipments, missed orders, and eroded margins as
    competitors win on consistency and cost.
