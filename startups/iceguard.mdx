leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented, manual compliance logging: Most ice plants rely on paper/Excel
      for sanitation, CCP, water tests, and training records, resulting in 2–5%
      missing/late entries per month and no real-time visibility.
    - >-
      Audit prep is slow and error-prone: Compiling binders for FDA/state/IPIA
      or customer audits takes 20–40 staff hours per audit and often leads to
      findings due to inconsistent documentation.
    - >-
      Reactive compliance: Gaps (missed water micro results, expired
      calibrations, out-of-spec chlorine/freezer temps) are discovered
      post-factum, increasing risk of violations, rework, or holds/recalls.
    - >-
      Inconsistent HACCP/FSMA record-keeping: Sites interpret CCP/monitoring and
      verification differently, causing variance across multi-site operations
      and elevated training overhead.
    - >-
      Labor constraints and turnover: Seasonal staffing and multilingual crews
      make SOP/SSOP adherence and timely training documentation difficult,
      inflating supervisor time by 5–10 hours/week/site.
    - >-
      Limited traceability and CAPA follow-through: Corrective actions and root
      causes are documented inconsistently; closure and effectiveness checks are
      rarely tracked with due dates and owners.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified digital logbook for sanitation, CCPs (e.g., sanitizer ppm, freezer
      temps), water testing (micro/chemical), calibrations, and training with
      mobile/offline capture and e-sign audit trails.
    - >-
      Rules engine and AI gap detection: monitors frequencies, limits, and
      required verifications; flags missing/late entries, out-of-spec readings,
      overdue training, and expiring calibrations.
    - >-
      Audit Pack Generator: one-click compilation of date-bounded binders with
      HACCP plan, hazard analysis, SSOPs, monitoring logs, CAPAs, training
      records, supplier docs, water test COAs, and maintenance/calibration
      records.
    - >-
      Scheduling and reminders: plant-level calendars with shift-based tasks,
      multilingual prompts, SMS/email/WhatsApp reminders and escalation.
    - >-
      Water test integration: ingest COAs from partner labs; map results to
      limits; auto-pass/fail; link to required corrective actions and
      verification evidence.
    - >-
      Corrective Action/CAPA workflow: assign owners, due dates, root cause
      fields, verification of effectiveness, and management review sign-off.
    - >-
      Multi-site oversight: dashboards to compare compliance completion %, open
      CAPAs, overdue tasks, and recurring issues across plants.
    - >-
      Data import and integrations: optional IoT sensor feeds (freezer/ambient
      temp, chlorine monitors), ERP/CMMS hooks, and SSO for enterprise.
    - >-
      Templates for ice manufacturing: prebuilt HACCP/SSOP forms aligned to IPIA
      PIQCS and FSMA Preventive Controls requirements; editable to site-specific
      process flows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single source of truth for HACCP/FSMA and IPIA compliance in packaged ice:
    consolidate all logs, auto-flag gaps in real time, and generate an
    audit-ready pack in minutes—reducing findings and cutting audit prep time by
    70–85%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt, ice-specific compliance templates and rules aligned with IPIA
    PIQCS and FSMA, plus lab/IoT integrations tailored to ice CCPs. One-click
    Audit Pack proven with early auditor feedback reduces prep from days to
    minutes, enabling 48-hour implementations for new sites.

    Ice plant QA/compliance managers and operations leaders who must keep HACCP,
    sanitation, CCP, water-quality, and training logs audit-ready.
  problem: >-
    Logs are scattered across clipboards and spreadsheets, making it easy to
    miss checks, limits, and signatures. Audit prep turns into a scramble and
    risks findings under FDA/FSMA, state health, GFSI/SQF, or IPIA PIQCS.

    platform built for NAICS 312113 centralize records, validate entries, and
    keep you audit-ready with proven templates.
  plan: >-
    Connect your forms, spreadsheets, and test data; map your HACCP plan (CCPs,
    limits, frequencies, owners); then let the AI auto-flag gaps, send
    reminders, and generate a one-click audit pack with logs, trends, and
    corrective actions.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot—upload sample logs and get an
    audit-ready pack in minutes.

    A single source of truth with complete, time-stamped, and signed records;
    fewer deviations; faster audits; confident customers; and lower compliance
    cost.
  failure: >-
    Persistent paper-chasing, missed CCP checks, nonconformances, fines, lost
    contracts, and potential production holds or recalls.
