leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Tour operators and DMCs receive high-volume, unstructured RFPs (PDFs,
      emails, spreadsheets) in multiple languages, creating a triage bottleneck
      and slow response times.
    - >-
      Manual parsing leads to errors: missed mandatory requirements, misread
      dates/pax/budget, and non-compliant submissions.
    - >-
      Multi-time-zone/language chains delay clarifications; unanswered questions
      cause no-bids or disqualifications.
    - >-
      Proposal teams spend 2–6 hours per RFP on extraction and first-draft
      assembly; peak seasons overwhelm capacity and increase overtime costs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent messaging and pricing logic across teams reduces win rates
      and erodes brand trust.
    - >-
      Existing generic RFP tools lack travel-specific entities (pax splits,
      rooming lists, F&B specs, coach sizes, visa/seasonality constraints) and
      itinerary-aware costing.
    - >-
      Compliance/risk: PII, GDPR, and client-specific clauses are hard to track
      without automated checks, risking penalties and redlines late in the
      cycle.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multilingual RFP ingestion from email, portals, and shared drives; OCR +
      translation; auto-detects language and splits attachments.
    - >-
      Domain-specific extraction of travel/MICE entities (pax counts, dates,
      rooming, F&B, transfers, venue specs, budget caps, must-haves).
    - >-
      Automated clarifying questions prioritized by risk/impact; sends via email
      or portal; tracks responses and updates draft.
    - >-
      Compliance matrix builder mapping requirements to response coverage;
      highlights gaps, risky clauses, and PII/GDPR flags.
    - >-
      First-draft generator: executive summary, itinerary outline,
      inclusions/exclusions, pricing placeholders, and terms; exports to
      Word/PowerPoint/PDF.
    - >-
      Knowledge re-use: mines past winning responses/templates; ensures tone,
      brand, and regional compliance; suggests upsell/cross-sell items.
    - >-
      Collaboration workflow: assign sections, due dates, internal SLAs;
      versioning, approvals, and audit trails.
    - >-
      Integrations: Salesforce/HubSpot, Tourplan/Juniper, Cvent Supplier
      Network, SharePoint/Google Drive, e-sign, and translation memory (TM).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Respond to any Groups/MICE RFP 2–3x faster, in any language, with higher
    compliance and win rates—purpose-built AI that extracts requirements, asks
    clarifying questions, and drafts compliant, cost-aware responses integrated
    with travel workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A travel/MICE-specific multilingual dataset and ontology coupled with deep
    integrations into tour-operator/DMC systems and RFP platforms, enabling
    high-accuracy extraction, context-grounded drafting, and compliance scoring
    that generic RFP tools and horizontal LLMs cannot match. Continuous learning
    from win/loss outcomes and human-in-the-loop edits compounds advantage over
    time.
