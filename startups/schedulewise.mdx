  problem:
    - >-
      Tax preparers spend 30–90 minutes per client manually cleaning and
      categorizing bank/credit card transactions for Schedule C/E/F, especially
      for clients without clean books.
    - >-
      Missed deductions (subscriptions, mileage, home office, mixed-use
      expenses) reduce client savings and firm perceived value; preparers lack
      systematic detection across all clients.
    - >-
      Inconsistent categorizations across staff increase review time and audit
      risk; no unified, audit-traceable mapping to IRS lines.
    - >-
      Import into tax software (Drake, ProSeries, Lacerte, UltraTax, TaxSlayer
      Pro, ATX) requires manual re-keying or error-prone CSV mapping.
    - >-
      Busy-season spikes strain capacity; hiring/training temps/outsourcers is
      costly and quality varies.
    - >-
      Client document collection is fragmented; getting complete, consented bank
      data quickly is hard and non-compliant if 7216 consents aren’t handled
      properly.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click bank/credit card connection (Plaid/Finicity/MX) or ledger import
      (QBO, Xero) plus CSV upload for community banks.
    - >-
      AI categorization engine maps transactions to tax-aware categories aligned
      to IRS Schedule C/E/F line items, with confidence scores and reasons.
    - >-
      Missed Deduction Finder flags patterns (e.g., recurring SaaS, vehicle
      expenses, home office allocations, merchant MCC anomalies) and suggests
      tax-safe reclassifications.
    - >-
      Review workflow: preparer approves, bulk-edits, and documents positions;
      client portal resolves questions via pre-built PBC requests; immutable
      audit log captures decisions.
    - >-
      Export import-ready summaries and mapped CSV/JSON to Drake, ProSeries,
      Lacerte, UltraTax, ATX, TaxWise; attachable workpapers (Excel/PDF) with
      drill-down.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: built-in IRC 7216 consent collection, GLBA
      Safeguards-aligned security, SOC 2 Type II controls, and standardized
      retention policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn raw bank, credit card, or ledger data into audit-ready Schedule C/E/F
    summaries in minutes — uncovering 3–7% more deductible expenses, saving
    45–75 minutes per return, and exporting directly to leading tax software
    with confidence scores and full 7216-compliant audit trails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Tax-line-specific models and ontology trained on multi-year, cross-industry
    preparer data with explainability; embedded 7216 consent and SOC 2 Type II
    controls that many generic bookkeeping tools lack; deep export integrations
    that output ready-to-import Schedule C/E/F summaries, minimizing rekeying
    and review time. Network effects from firm policy templates and benchmarking
    improve accuracy and ROI over time.
