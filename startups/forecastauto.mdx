leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High stockouts on fast-moving, vehicle-specific SKUs (batteries, filters,
      wipers, sensors) due to limited fitment-aware forecasting; typical
      stockout rate 10–15% on long-tail items by season and vehicle parc.
    - >-
      Excess capital tied up in slow-moving and obsolete inventory (10–25% of
      inventory value) from generic forecasting and vendor-driven promotions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (POS/ERP, e-commerce, distributor catalogs, ACES/PIES
      fitment) prevents accurate SKU-vehicle-season demand planning at the store
      level.
    - >-
      Manual PO creation consumes 10–20 hours/week per planner; approvals lack
      guardrails, leading to over/under-ordering and inconsistent vendor
      compliance.
    - >-
      Lead time variability by vendor/DC and region not modeled; safety stock
      set via rules of thumb, hurting service levels and working capital.
    - >-
      Multi-location chains underuse inter-store transfers and cluster
      forecasting; missed opportunities to rebalance and reduce expedites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest POS/ERP history and fitment data (ACES/PIES/SEMA Data); generate
      weekly SKU-location forecasts segmented by vehicle YMM, climate zone,
      promotion, and calendar season.
    - >-
      Dynamic safety stock and reorder points tuned to desired service levels
      (e.g., 96–98%) using vendor- and item-specific lead time distributions and
      MOQ/pack-size constraints.
    - >-
      Auto-PO suggestions by vendor with budget checks, open-to-buy, and
      fill-the-truck logic; configurable approval thresholds and audit trails.
    - >-
      Multi-location logic: suggest inter-store transfers vs. buys; cluster
      forecasting for nearby stores with similar vehicle parc and weather
      patterns.
    - >-
      EDI and portal-ready ordering: push POs to suppliers (850/855/856) and
      ingest ASNs; track confirmations vs. expected arrivals to auto-adjust
      forecasting.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow: highlight new item introductions,
      cannibalization, supersessions, and items at risk of stockout/overstock
      within 14 days.
    - >-
      Promo/season planner: simulate lifts for weather events and promotions;
      what-if scenarios for vendor lead time changes or price breaks.
    - >-
      E-commerce harmonization: merge online demand with store allocations;
      prevent double-counting with configurable attribution rules.
    - >-
      Continuous model learning: weekly recalibration using realized error, new
      fitment, and local vehicle parc changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Fitment-aware, climate- and seasonality-adjusted SKU forecasting with
    one-click Auto-POs and an auditable approval workflow that raises fill rates
    2–4 points, cuts excess inventory 15–25%, and frees planners 8–12
    hours/week—without changing your ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Fitment-first forecasting IP and climate-aware models trained on anonymized
    multi-retailer data, plus pre-built connectors to leading aftermarket ERPs
    and EDI networks. Early distributor partnerships provide trustworthy
    lead-time signals and catalog accuracy, enabling faster time-to-value and
    higher automation rates than generic inventory tools. Audit-ready Auto-PO
    workflows tailored to buying groups and vendor programs create switching
    costs and embed us in planners’ daily operations.

    Auto parts and accessories retailers/eCommerce buyers who want the right
    SKU-by-vehicle in stock with minimal capital, no surprises, and fewer manual

    We understand auto parts replenishment and build AI for supply chains. Our
    platform learns from your POS/ERP, fitment catalogs, lead times, and seasons
    to deliver transparent SKU-level forecasts and Auto-PO suggestions you
    control.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect POS/ERP, supplier, and fitment data; 2) Review and tune
    forecasts, safety stock, and rules; 3) Approve or auto-approve PO
    suggestions; monitor exceptions and vendor performance.

    forecast accuracy and stock health report.
  success: >-
    Fast movers stay in stock across YMM and seasons; slow-mover excess drops;
    higher fill rates, turns, and margins; fewer expedites; buyers focus on
    vendor strategy and promotions instead of spreadsheets.
