  problem:
    - >-
      Sales engineers and application engineers spend 3–8 hours per proposal
      creating GA drawings, 3D views, and load reactions, slowing quote
      turnaround by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      High variability and human error in drawings and notes lead to costly
      rework, credibility loss, and change orders (1–3% of jobs face
      drawing-related disputes).
    - >-
      Inconsistent branding and standards across dealers/OEMs; template drift
      and outdated notes cause compliance and liability risks (OSHA/CMAA
      references).
    - >-
      Large OEMs have costly in-house configurators; small/midsize manufacturers
      rely on manual CAD or ad hoc macros that don’t scale or integrate with
      CRM/CPQ.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly request BIM/3D and early load reaction data for
      facility planning—most dealers can’t deliver quickly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Input wizard: key parameters (capacity, span, lift, CMAA class, building
      envelope, runway length/column spacing, hook approaches, electrification,
      duty, hoist type, environment).
    - >-
      Rules engine: code-aware constraints and sizing heuristics (CMAA 70/74
      references, OSHA notes) to validate feasibility and derive missing
      parameters (clearances, wheel loads, hook coverage, runway reactions).
    - >-
      Layout generator: places bridge, runway, columns, bracing, electrification
      (festoon/conductor bar), end stops, maintenance platforms, monorail
      curves/switches; proposes typicals for single/double girder and
      underhung/top-running.
    - >-
      Auto-doc pack: GA plan/elevations, sections, notes, 3D lightweight model
      (glTF/IFC), preliminary load reaction tables, bill-of-material summary,
      and submittal cover—all with client’s title block and branding.
    - >-
      One-click exports: DWG/DXF/PDF for 2D; IFC/glTF for BIM/3D; CSV/JSON for
      CPQ/BOM; revision tracking and comparison views.
    - >-
      Browser viewer: interactive 3D viewing, redlines, comments; shareable link
      for buyers and GCs; watermarking and expiration controls.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations: Salesforce/HubSpot, common CPQ
      (KBMax/ConfigureOne), CAD/PDM (Autodesk, SolidWorks), and document
      management (SharePoint).
    - >-
      Template studio: no-code configuration of notes, title blocks, default
      options, and approval stamps; version control with audit trail.
    - >-
      Accuracy guardrails: dimensional checks, approach checks, collision
      detection within layout assumptions; clear “proposal-level only” labeling
      for liability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate brand-ready GA drawings, BIM-ready 3D models, and preliminary load
    reactions for overhead cranes in under 2 minutes from 10–20
    inputs—standardized, code-aware, and integrated with your sales workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, code-aware template library and rules engine purpose-built for
    overhead cranes, enriched by OEM catalogs and anonymized industry
    data—delivering 2D/3D submittals in minutes, white-labeled through
    OEM/dealer networks, and hard to replicate without deep domain rules and
    distribution partnerships.

  character: >-
    Sales engineers, estimators, and dealers at overhead traveling crane, hoist,
    and monorail manufacturers (NAICS 333923) who need rapid, accurate GA
    drawings and 3D visuals for quotes and submittals.
  problem: >-
    Manual CAD and inconsistent rules slow proposals and cause errors; they feel
    constant time pressure and believe buyers deserve clear, accurate layouts in
    hours—not weeks.
  guide: >-
    We understand the crane-quoting crunch. Our Parametric Crane Layout & 3D
    Model Generator encodes industry clearances and proven layout rules,
    delivering consistent outputs and fitting existing CAD/PLM workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Enter key parameters (capacity, span, lift, building geometry, hook
    approach, runway/monorail path). 2) Auto-generate sales-level GA drawings
    and lightweight 3D in minutes. 3) Review, tweak, and export PDF/DWG/STEP
    with a BOM summary, then attach to CPQ/CRM.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot using a current RFQ.
  success: >-
    Same-day layouts, faster quote turnaround, higher win rates, standardized
    documents, fewer change orders, and engineers focused on engineered-to-order
    work—not drafting.
  failure: >-
    Slow responses, lost bids, rework from clearance mistakes, brand
    inconsistency, and a growing engineering backlog.
