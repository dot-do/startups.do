  problem:
    - >-
      Exploration and resource-definition drilling is capital intensive
      ($100–$400 per meter) and often inefficient, with 15–30% of meters
      delivering low information gain due to suboptimal hole placement and
      sequencing.
    - >-
      Manual drill targeting is slow (days to weeks per campaign), subjective,
      and struggles to incorporate many constraints (budget, access, permits,
      safety, rig capability, seasonal windows) simultaneously.
    - >-
      Uncertainty is not explicitly quantified; teams over/under-drill areas to
      reach JORC/NI 43-101 confidence thresholds, delaying PEA/PFS/FS milestones
      and mine-life extensions by months.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across geological models, drill databases, geophysics,
      hyperspectral, and block models; integrating these into a repeatable,
      auditable decision workflow is difficult.
    - >-
      Inefficient drill sequencing increases cost and HSE exposure (extra pad
      moves, rig standby), and can constrain cash flow by delaying resource
      conversion and mine planning updates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate project data (drillholes, assays, geophysics, geological
      domains, block models, topography, pads/roads, permits) via connectors
      (acQuire, MX Deposit, Leapfrog/Seequent, Deswik, Vulcan).
    - >-
      Quantify subsurface uncertainty using Bayesian geostatistics and
      conditional simulations to produce uncertainty maps tied to economic value
      (grade-tonnage, NPV/ton, recovery).
    - >-
      Define objectives: maximize information gain per dollar, maximize expected
      economic value, or multi-objective (with a risk tolerance slider).
    - >-
      Encode constraints: budget, pad locations, rig capability/angles,
      access/permitting, environmental buffers, safety standoffs, seasonal
      weather, shift schedules.
    - >-
      Run a constrained optimizer (active learning/survey design) to generate
      ranked next-hole candidates with expected information/value uplift and
      drill sequences/schedules.
    - >-
      Provide scenario planning (A/B campaigns), sensitivity analysis, and
      explainability (what key uncertainties each hole reduces).
    - >-
      Operationalize via plugin/API inside existing software (e.g.,
      Leapfrog/Seequent Central) with audit logs and versioning; export plans to
      Deswik/Vulcan and contractor formats.
    - >-
      Measure realized vs predicted outcomes post-drilling to continuously
      calibrate and improve models.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut meters and months to certainty. NH-DPO proposes the highest-information
    or highest-value next drillholes under real-world budget and access
    constraints, delivering 20–30% fewer meters to reach target confidence and
    2–6 months faster resource updates—audited, explainable, and embedded in
    your current geology workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, constraint-aware active-learning engine tuned specifically
    for gold/silver drilling that optimizes both information and economic
    value—backed by a growing corpus of anonymized drilling outcomes for
    priors/calibration, deep integrations with geoscience toolchains, and a
    pilot-to-proof playbook that quantifies realized savings and
    time-to-confidence gains.

  character: >-
    Exploration and mine planning teams in gold and silver mining (NAICS 212220)
    who must allocate limited drill meters to maximize resource confidence and
    project value.
  problem: >-
    External: scattered targets, tight budgets, access and permit limits;
    Internal: uncertainty about which hole delivers the most value and how to
    defend the plan; Philosophical: drilling should be driven by data, not gut
    or politics.
  guide: >-
    Next-Hole Drill Planning Optimizer—AI built by mining data scientists; we’ve
    seen teams burn meters on low-yield holes and miss schedule gates. We apply
    geostatistics and optimization to surface the highest-information or
    highest-value next holes, transparently and defensibly.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Ingest collars, assays, geology, block models, costs, and
    access/permit layers; 2) Quantify uncertainty, value, and risk; 3) Optimize
    next-hole candidates under budget and access constraints; 4) Deliver ranked
    holes with expected information gain/NPV uplift and export to your planning
    tools. Assurance: secure deployment, clear assumptions, and rapid iteration.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30-day pilot using your current dataset. Transitional:
    Request a sample optimization report and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Drill fewer redundant meters while increasing certainty per meter; faster
    upgrades from Inferred to Indicated/Measured; clearer NPV/IRR impacts;
    safer, compliant access plans; defensible decisions that win stakeholder
    confidence and keep schedules on track.
  failure: >-
    Over-drill low-value zones, miss high-impact targets, slip timelines,
    overrun drilling budgets, and face audit challenges—plans driven by
    spreadsheets and intuition instead of data-backed optimization.
