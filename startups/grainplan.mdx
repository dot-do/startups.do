leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Highly volatile SKU demand (seasonality, promotions, retailer programs)
      creates chronic over/under-stocking; typical WAPE 25–45% and service
      levels <90% for long-tail SKUs.
    - >-
      Schedulers rely on spreadsheets or generic ERP APS that ignore
      sequence-dependent changeovers, kiln/cure time, and labor skills—leading
      to excessive setups, overtime, and late orders.
    - >-
      Capacity is finite and multi-constraint: dryers/kilns, finishing lines,
      and skilled labor are bottlenecks; current schedules violate real-world
      limits, causing expedites and rescheduling churn.
    - >-
      Data exists but is siloed (ERP, MES, time clocks, maintenance calendars);
      planners lack a single, trustworthy plan connecting demand, capacity, and
      labor.
    - >-
      Small/mid plants can’t justify heavy APS implementations; enterprise tools
      are expensive, slow to implement (6–18 months), and not tailored to
      wood-specific processes (species/tooling/finish changeovers).
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand forecasting: hierarchical, SKU/customer/channel forecasts with
      seasonality, promotions, and macro signals; probabilistic outputs for
      safety stock and service targets.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling: sequence-dependent setup modeling by species,
      thickness, finish, tooling; kiln/cure and labor skill constraints;
      rolling-horizon scheduling (2–12 weeks) with daily re-optimization.
    - >-
      Integrated S&OE workbench: drag-and-drop schedule with constraint checks,
      what-if scenarios, and automatic recompute of downstream effects.
    - >-
      Changeover minimization: family batching and color/species sequencing to
      reduce setups while honoring due dates/OTIF.
    - >-
      Labor planning: skill matrices, shift calendars, cross-training effects;
      overtime and temp costs modeled in the objective function.
    - >-
      Data connectors: ERP/MES integrations (Epicor, Infor CSI, Dynamics,
      NetSuite, JobBOSS/ECI, DELMIAworks), CSV/SFTP APIs; built-in data quality
      diagnostics.
    - >-
      Explainability: forecast drivers (seasonality, promo), schedule rationale
      (critical bottlenecks, setup trade-offs), and KPI impact projections.
    - >-
      Secure deployment: SaaS in SOC 2-ready cloud or private VPC; optional
      on-prem edge scheduler for plants with strict IT policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast accurately and schedule feasibly—one AI that predicts SKU demand
    and produces capacity- and labor-feasible plans with changeover-aware
    optimization, cutting lateness, setups, and overtime within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned constraint library for wood manufacturing (kiln/cure,
    species/finish/tooling changeovers) and a growing anonymized dataset of
    setup patterns and run rates enabling superior schedules out-of-the-box;
    coupled with prebuilt ERP connectors and a pilot playbook that proves ROI
    within 90 days.

    Plant managers and schedulers in All Other Miscellaneous Wood Product
    Manufacturing (NAICS 321999) who must deliver on-time orders without blowing
    labor and material budgets.
  problem: >-
    Volatile, SKU-heavy demand plus frequent changeovers and labor/kiln
    constraints make spreadsheet planning unreliable—leading to missed ship
    dates, overtime, and excess inventory. Making quality wood products
    shouldn’t require firefighting and guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’re an AI planning partner for wood manufacturing. Our platform forecasts
    SKU demand and builds capacity-feasible schedules that honor changeover
    matrices, crew skills, shift calendars, and work-center limits. We integrate
    with your ERP/MES and coach your team through adoption.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES data (orders, routings, changeovers, labor, calendars).
    2) Calibrate on 12-24 months of history and run a 4-week pilot. 3) Go live
    with weekly S&OP forecasts and daily finite schedules, with training and KPI
    reviews.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo to see your demand and a sample finite schedule for
    one product family. Or request the readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Reliable promise dates and higher OTIF, fewer changeovers and setups,
    smoother shifts with balanced crews, lower overtime and expediting, leaner
    inventory, higher throughput and margins.
  failure: >-
    Without a better plan, firefighting continues: late orders, premium freight,
    idle or overworked crews, stockouts and overstock, eroding margins, and
    frustrated customers.

  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, seasonal demand across many SKUs drives stockouts or excess
      inventory.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheets can’t model sequence‑dependent changeovers, kiln/press
      curing, or labor limits.
    - >-
      Mixed make‑to‑stock/make‑to‑order orders make trade‑offs and due‑date
      promises risky.
    - >-
      Bottlenecks at planers, CNC routers, finish lines, or kilns ripple across
      the plant.
    - 'Rush orders, scrap, and late supplier deliveries blow up static schedules.'
    - Overtime and frequent changeovers inflate cost per unit.
    - Low forecast accuracy and poor service levels erode key accounts.

    - AI forecasting at SKU/customer/channel with seasonality and promotions.
    - >-
      Finite‑capacity scheduling across lines and cells with sequence‑dependent
      setups and family campaigns.
