  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers inherit inconsistent, incomplete, or incorrect specs from
      distributor feeds (e.g., string gauge formats, reed strengths, mouthpiece
      tip openings), causing customer confusion and returns.
    - >-
      Generic AI copywriters generate fluent but inaccurate product details;
      internal teams spend hours validating content against brand sheets and
      PDFs.
    - >-
      SEO underperforms because titles, bullets, alt text, and FAQs aren’t
      optimized for high-intent queries (e.g., "10-46 nickel wound strings"),
      leading to low CTR and lost revenue.
    - >-
      Duplicate or near-duplicate SKUs across color/finish/left-right variants
      cannibalize rankings and dilute reviews.
    - >-
      Google Merchant Center, Amazon, and Reverb listing errors
      (GTIN/brand/mismatch) cause disapprovals, suppression, and wasted ad
      spend.
    - >-
      Manual content production doesn’t scale for retailers with 10k–200k SKUs;
      backlog grows and content gets stale when models change.
    - >-
      Lack of structured data (schema.org) and normalized attributes blocks
      faceted navigation and poor site search/filtering.
    - >-
      Measuring impact is hard; teams lack SKU-level attribution for organic
      lift, conversion, and return-rate reduction.
  solution:
    - >-
      Verticalized AI trained on MI domain to generate and maintain titles,
      bullets, descriptions, alt text, and FAQs with verified specs.
    - >-
      Normalization engine standardizes attributes (e.g., string gauge to
      .010–.046, reed strength to ISO-like scale) and maps to your taxonomy.
    - >-
      Cross-source verification against brand sheets, distributor catalogs, and
      GTIN registries to achieve high factual accuracy.
    - >-
      SEO scoring and templating for category- and intent-specific titles and
      metadata; schema.org Product/Offer/Ratings injection.
    - >-
      Variant consolidation: deduplicate, unify reviews, and present clean
      selectable attributes for better UX and SEO.
    - >-
      Marketplace policy guardrails for GMC/Amazon/Reverb with pre-flight checks
      and auto-fix recommendations.
    - >-
      Continuous refresh pipeline that tracks model refreshes, discontinued
      products, and MAP changes to keep content current.
    - >-
      Impact analytics at SKU and category level: organic sessions, CTR,
      add-to-cart, conversion rate, and return reasons.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-grade content your merchandisers can trust: MI-specific normalization +
    SEO that lifts traffic and conversion while reducing returns—continuously
    maintained across your entire catalog.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary MI-specific normalization ontology and cross-source verification
    graph trained on brand/distributor ground truth, plus feedback loops from
    expert reviewers. This yields measurably higher factual accuracy and
    marketplace compliance than generic AI copy tools or vanilla PIMs.
