leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, SKU-level demand causes frequent stockouts of fast movers (e.g.,
      color/tex/customer-specific threads) and overstock of slow movers, tying
      up 10–20% excess working capital.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-based planning struggles with thousands of SKUs,
      complex BOMs (fiber blends, dye lots), and machine constraints (ring
      spinning, winding, twisting, dyeing) leading to 5–15% lost capacity from
      suboptimal sequencing and avoidable changeovers.
    - >-
      Forecasts provided by sales are inconsistent, not statistically grounded,
      and rarely at the SKU-customer level; MAPE typically >35% at weekly
      granularity.
    - >-
      Raw fiber procurement (cotton, PSF, viscose) is decoupled from true
      blended demand; lead-time and price volatility cause rush buys and quality
      misalignment, adding 1–3% to COGS.
    - >-
      Poor plan adherence and lack of scenario planning force reactive
      firefighting; OTIF below 90%, premium freight and overtime are common.
    - >-
      ERP/MES modules are generic; textile-specific constraints (blend ratios,
      shade bands, cone/dye lot relationships, minimum lot sizes, bobbin-to-cone
      conversions) are not modeled well, causing plan infeasibility.
    - >-
      Lack of unified data model across ERP (orders/BOM), MES (machine states),
      WMS (inventory, lots), LIMS (quality) blocks end-to-end visibility and
      continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration layer ingests orders, shipments, BOMs/blend recipes,
      routings, calendars, machine states, inventory by lot, quality grades from
      ERP/MES/WMS/LIMS (SAP, Infor, Oracle, Dynamics, Datatex, Coats Digital,
      custom).
    - >-
      Probabilistic, hierarchical SKU-customer-week forecasting using gradient
      boosting + Prophet/ETS ensembles with Bayesian reconciliation across
      hierarchy (product-family → count/tex → blend → color → customer).
    - >-
      Cold-start logic via attribute similarity (count/ply/finish/color,
      channel, geography) for new/seasonal SKUs; promotion and event tagging;
      manual overrides with audit trail.
    - >-
      Optimization engine (MILP/CP-SAT) for weekly finite-capacity scheduling
      across spinning/winding/twisting/dyeing with: setup/changeover times,
      shade banding, minimum lot sizes, shift calendars, preventive maintenance,
      and labor constraints.
    - >-
      Raw fiber procurement optimizer aligning blend ratios and quality
      requirements to demand distribution and supplier MOQs/lead times; includes
      hedge timing recommendations using commodity price signals (ICE cotton,
      PTA).
    - >-
      Scenario sandbox: what-if simulations for service level targets, overtime,
      outsourcing, postponement (dye-in-greige), and alternate blends; compare
      KPIs and costs before commit.
    - >-
      Plan execution cockpit: commit weekly plan, track plan adherence,
      re-optimize on exceptions (machine down, rush order), with alerts
      (stockout risk, expiring lots, underutilization).
    - >-
      Explainability: forecast drivers, confidence intervals, backtests
      (MAPE/WAPE) by family/plant/customer; constraint visualizations and
      bottleneck identification.
    - >-
      APIs and UI: role-based dashboards, Excel plugin for planner workflows;
      integration to purchase requisitions, production orders, and allocation in
      ERP; audit logs.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SSO, RBAC, data encryption, private VPC; optional
      on-prem gateway for MES connectivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SKU-granular demand forecasts and an optimized, constraint-aware weekly
    machine and fiber procurement plan purpose-built for yarn/thread mills—cut
    inventory 10–20%, raise OTIF by 3–6 points, and unlock 5–8% more throughput
    within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A textile-specific optimization library (blend-aware, dye/shade constraints,
    cone/bobbin conversions) and anonymized benchmarking dataset enabling

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, planning, and supply chain leaders at fiber, yarn, and thread
    mills who want reliable SKU‑week forecasts and a clear weekly machine and
    fiber procurement plan to hit service targets at the lowest cost.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile orders, seasonal mix, and constraints (blend, twist,
    dye‑lot, cone size) make accurate planning hard. Internal: Teams firefight
    in spreadsheets; plans shift late; confidence is low across sales,
    production, and purchasing. Philosophical: Mill teams shouldn’t have to
    choose between service and margin—they should have both.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know mill realities—changeovers, spin/wind/twist bottlenecks,
    fiber grade availability, dye‑lot limits. Authority: Mill‑proven AI for
    SKU‑granular forecasting and optimized machine/procurement plans; secure,
    fast to pilot, integrates with ERP/MES.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect and calibrate: ingest orders, BOMs/recipes, routings, capacities,
    inventory; train SKU/market forecasts. 2) Pilot (4–6 weeks): compare to
    baseline, validate weekly machine plans and fiber buys with your team. 3) Go
    live: weekly S&OP cadence with alerts and one‑click machine + procurement
    plans; continuous model tuning—no rip‑and‑replace.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a 6‑week pilot. Transitional: Book a 30‑minute assessment or
    request a sample forecast/plan from your last 12 months of data.
  success: >-
    Higher forecast accuracy at SKU/week, 95%+ OTIF with lower inventory, fewer
    changeovers and expedites, higher asset utilization, fewer fiber stockouts,
    aligned sales‑to‑shop‑floor plan everyone trusts.
  failure: >-
    Without this: continued guesswork, excess WIP and write‑offs, overtime and
    unplanned downtime, late orders and lost customers, margin erosion.
