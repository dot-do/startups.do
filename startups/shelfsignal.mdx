  problem:
    - >-
      Independent book retailers and news dealers lack time and expertise to
      keep Google Business Profiles (GBP) fully optimized and active, leading to
      lost local discovery and foot traffic.
    - >-
      Listings often have outdated hours, missing categories/attributes, and
      sparse photos—hurting rank for “bookstore near me,” “magazines near me,”
      and long-tail searches.
    - >-
      Staff struggle to publish consistent GBP posts and event updates (author
      signings, new arrivals, staff picks), causing low engagement and missed
      high-intent conversions.
    - >-
      Review responses are delayed or off-brand, reducing rating recovery and
      trust; Q&A goes unanswered, creating buyer friction.
    - >-
      Owners don’t have clear, actionable reporting linking GBP activity to real
      outcomes (directions requests, calls, website clicks, in-store event
      attendance).
  solution:
    - >-
      Automate weekly GBP posts that highlight new releases, staff picks,
      events, and promos; schedule 52+ optimized posts/year per location.
    - >-
      AI-driven review response assistant with brand voice templates, escalation
      rules, and compliance to Google policies; target <24-hour median response
      time.
    - >-
      Q&A management: auto-detect new questions, suggest accurate answers from a
      curated knowledge base (hours, special orders, magazine availability), and
      escalate edge cases.
    - >-
      Listing hygiene: proactive audits and fixes (hours, holiday hours,
      categories, attributes, services, photos, short name, products/books
      feature).
    - >-
      Local rank tracking for 20–50 keywords per location with geo-grid
      heatmaps, plus UTM-tagged CTA tracking (calls, directions, site clicks).
    - >-
      Micro-campaigns around tentpole dates (Bookstore Day, back-to-school,
      holidays) and weekly cadence that rotates formats (offer, event,
      educational, new-in).
    - >-
      Inventory/event integrations (POS/website) to auto-surface new arrivals
      and events without manual entry.
    - >-
      Monthly ROI reports that map GBP actions to outcomes: views, discovery vs.
      branded searches, direction requests, calls, CTR, review velocity, rating
      changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Done-for-you GBP freshness and local SEO tailored to book and news retail.
    We turn inventory, events, and reviews into weekly, on-brand GBP activity
    that ranks, engages, and converts nearby readers—without adding work for
    store staff.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep, verticalized content and integrations: a library of
    bookstore/newsstand-specific post templates and response playbooks, plus
