  title: COA Parsing & Quality Variance Triage
  description: >-
    Parses lab COAs and lot photos to detect anomalies vs. specs; routes
    exceptions for QA decisions.
  targetUsers:
    - Quality Managers
    - Warehouse Ops
    - Buyers/Traders
  triggers:
    - New COA received or lot check-in
    - IoT reading out of range
  inputs:
    - 'COA PDFs (moisture, aflatoxin, pesticide residues, fiber length, etc.)'
    - Lot photos or short videos
    - Spec library by SKU/grade/buyer
    - IoT/handheld readings (moisture/temp)
  steps:
    - OCR and extract COA metrics; normalize units
    - Compare to SKU/buyer specs and regulatory thresholds
    - 'Image-based visual checks (color, contamination cues)'
    - Score risk; propose disposition (accept/hold/retest/divert)
    - Generate exception report and notify responsible owner
  tools:
    - AWS Textract
    - LLM-based field extraction with schema validation
    - Simple CV models for image QA
    - Rules/threshold engine
    - Slack/Email for alerts
  outputs:
    - Structured COA data per lot
    - Pass/fail and exception list with reasons
    - Disposition suggestions and audit trail
  pricingModel:
    - Per-COA/lot processed
    - Volume discounts

    modelCapability: 7

  risks:
    - >-
      Model may miss subtle contaminants—tool is assistive, not a QA release
      authority
    - Low-quality scans/photos reduce accuracy
    - Spec misalignment across buyers
  dependencies:
    - Spec library by SKU/buyer
    - Access to COAs and lot images
    - QA SOPs for final decisions
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual COA parsing and photo review are slow (5–12 minutes per COA; 2–3
      per lot), error-prone, and create QA bottlenecks during harvest/peak
      seasons.
    - >-
      COA formats vary wildly by lab (PDF, image, CSV), leading to missed
      critical fields (e.g., aflatoxin, pesticide residues) and inconsistent
      data entry into ERP/LIMS.
    - >-
      Specs differ by buyer/commodity/season; applying the correct spec and
      tolerance windows is inconsistent across teams and locations.
    - >-
      Late detection of out-of-spec lots causes rework, chargebacks, missed ship
      windows, and deteriorating supplier/buyer relationships.
    - >-
      QA staffing is thin; onboarding new staff to commodity-specific risk
      factors is costly; tribal knowledge isn’t captured in systems.
    - >-
      Audit readiness (SQF, BRCGS, FSMA) is burdensome; reconciling COAs, photo
      evidence, and decision rationale for audits consumes days of effort.
    - >-
      Existing OCR or generic document AI tools lack commodity-specific field
      extraction and validation logic (units, LOQs, methods), forcing heavy
      customization.
    - >-
      Photo-based quality issues (foreign matter, mold, insect damage, color
      variance) are often missed until downstream, increasing claims risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal COA ingestion (email, SFTP, API, portal upload) with
      commodity-aware extraction of critical fields (e.g., aflatoxin B1/total,
      Salmonella, E. coli, heavy metals, pesticide residues, moisture, ash,
      volatile oil).
    - >-
      Spec and tolerance engine that maps lots to the correct buyer/commodity
      spec (versioned, effective-dated) and validates units, methods, LOQs, and
      conversions.
    - >-
      Photo analysis models for foreign matter, mold/insect damage, color/grade
      variance, broken/defect ratio; supports mobile capture at
      intake/warehouse.
    - >-
      Risk scoring that prioritizes exceptions (critical vs. major vs. minor)
      and recommends disposition (accept/hold/rework/reject) with rationale and
      references.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop triage workspace with audit trails, side-by-side COA
      parsing, image annotations, and one-click ERP/LIMS updates.
    - >-
      Integrations with common ERPs (NetSuite, SAP Business One, MS Dynamics
      365, Sage X3, Infor M3) and lab partners (SGS, Eurofins, Intertek) via
      APIs/EDI.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: system improves from QA decisions; configurable
      feedback loops to tighten precision/recall by commodity and supplier.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that reads any lab COA and lot photo, applies your buyer/commodity specs,
    flags anomalies with confidence scores, and routes only true exceptions to
    QA—cutting QA cycle time by 60–80% and reducing quality-related chargebacks
    by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Commodity- and method-aware extraction and validation models trained on a
    large, curated corpus of COAs and defect images, plus a living spec/rules
    library and first-party integrations with major labs and ERPs—creating
    switching costs and performance levels generic OCR/document AI cannot match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops/QA leader at an Other Farm Product Raw Material Merchant Wholesaler who
    needs every inbound lot to meet spec without slowing shipments or risking
    compliance.
  problem: >-
    - External: COAs arrive in inconsistent formats from many labs; units and
    limits vary; photo checks miss color/foreign matter; receiving is rushed and
    audit exposure is real.

    - Internal: Constant worry about missing an out‑of‑spec lot and triggering
    rework, returns, or a recall.

    - Philosophical: Quality decisions should be fast, factual, and
    traceable—data chaos shouldn’t put safety or margins at risk.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived inbound QC and supplier variability—we know the
    pressure at the dock door and during audits.

    - Authority: AI trained on industry COAs and lot images; normalizes and
    validates units; secure, audit‑ready, and integrates with ERP/WMS/QMS;
    proven with leading wholesalers.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect specs, suppliers, and lab formats; set thresholds and routing
    rules.

    2) Auto‑ingest COAs and lot photos; AI parses, normalizes, and compares to
    specs.

    3) Exceptions are triaged to QA with evidence; click
    Accept/Quarantine/Reject; updates sync back via API.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot on your recent
    lots.

    - Transitional: Send sample COAs/photos for a free normalization test and
    exception heatmap/ROI snapshot.
  success: >-
    - Faster, confident receiving; significant reduction in manual QA effort.

    - Fewer chargebacks, returns, and supplier disputes; stronger scorecards.

    - Audit‑ready traceability and documentation; safer product, protected
    margins, and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    - Keep sifting through messy COAs, miss variances, and face delays, rework,
    fines, or recalls.

    - Burn out the QA team, erode margins, damage relationships, and risk lost
    contracts.
