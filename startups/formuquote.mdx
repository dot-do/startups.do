leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Sales teams quote custom feed formulas with spreadsheets/ERP workarounds,
      taking 4–48 hours, causing slow response and lost deals.
    - >-
      Input costs (corn/soy/wheat/lysine/vitamins) change daily; quotes often
      use stale costs, eroding margins by 50–200 bps.
    - >-
      Formulation-to-spec often requires nutritionist sign-off; back-and-forth
      reformulations delay quotes and introduce errors.
    - >-
      Margin floors are not enforced at the line-item/spec level; reps discount
      below policy to win volume, creating invisible margin leakage.
    - >-
      Freight and packaging costs vary by lane and pack size; shipping
      misestimates lead to negative lines on delivery.
    - >-
      Label, medicated, and customer-spec compliance (AAFCO/FSMA/VFD notes) is
      manual, risky, and inconsistent across plants.
    - >-
      Version control and approvals are fragmented; audit trails for pricing
      rationale, ingredient substitutions, and approvals are weak.
    - >-
      Integrations between formulation, ERP, and CRM are brittle, so won/lost
      analysis and price performance are opaque.
    - >-
      Large customers demand cost-plus formulas or commodity indexation; many
      suppliers cannot operationalize indexed quotes reliably.
  solution:
    - >-
      Formulation-aware quote engine: auto-builds customer-specific formulas to
      declared specs, constraints, and label claims using current ingredient
      costs.
    - >-
      Dynamic margin guard: enforces floor margins at product/spec/customer
      levels with approvals for exceptions and real-time warnings.
    - >-
      Live cost model: pulls commodity prices and supplier quotes; maps hedges
      and contracts to effective COGS by plant and time window.
    - >-
      Freight and packaging calculator: lane-based rates, pack-size and
      palletization logic, fuel surcharge and accessorials.
    - >-
      Compliance assistant: AAFCO/FSMA label checks, VFD reminders,
      allergen/medication flags, required documentation bundling with quotes.
    - >-
      Quote collaboration and approvals: roles, workflows, and complete audit
      trails; customer-specific terms and indexation templates.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors to formulation tools (e.g., Bestmix/Brill), ERP
      (SAP/Infor/Deacom), CRM (Salesforce), and e-signature.
    - >-
      Analytics: margin leakage dashboard, win/loss with price-to-spec
      benchmarking, cost variance, and rep/policy adherence.
    - >-
      AI copilot: suggests ingredient substitutions, indexation structures, and
      price ranges based on historical wins and current costs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, formulation-aware CPQ that prices to today’s input costs and
    enforces margin floors by spec, eliminating margin leakage while cutting
    quote cycle time from days to minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A formulation-aware CPQ engine purpose-built for animal feed that ties live
    ingredient costs, hedges, and plant constraints directly to quotes with
    automated margin-floor enforcement—delivering measurable bps recovery and
    cycle-time gains that generic CPQ and pricing tools cannot match. Early
    partnerships and proprietary connectors to formulation/ERP systems plus
    anonymized spec-to-price benchmarks create defensibility.
