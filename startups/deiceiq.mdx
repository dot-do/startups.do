leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable deicing pad queues during winter events cause TSAT/CTOT
      (EDCT in the US) misses, leading to push delays, slot penalties, and
      knock-on network disruption.
    - >-
      Lack of a common operating picture across AOCC, ramp control, deicing
      operators, tower/CDM, and airlines results in suboptimal pad assignments
      and push sequences.
    - >-
      Most DMAN/A-CDM tools do not explicitly model deicing resource constraints
      (pads, trucks, fluid class, HOT), making TSAT predictions brittle in
      winter operations.
    - >-
      Weather variability (precipitation intensity/type shifts) and HOT
      expiration trigger last-minute re-deice events that current tools fail to
      anticipate.
    - >-
      Inefficient pad utilization (uneven load across pads, deadhead taxiing,
      blocked access) reduces departure throughput by 5–20% in peak events.
    - >-
      Excess taxi/idle time increases fuel burn (typ. 50–150 kg per delayed
      departure) and emissions; glycol usage and re-deice events increase
      operating cost and environmental risk.
    - >-
      Airports and deicing operators lack quantitative, predictive KPIs (e.g.,
      expected pad wait by tail, HOT expiry risk) to make proactive decisions
      within minutes-to-hours horizons.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time queue forecasting engine that fuses AODB/CDM milestones
      (TOBT/TSAT/TTOT), surface surveillance (ASDE-X/A-SMGCS/ADS-B), deicing ops
      data (pad status, truck allocation, fluid class), runway config, and
      high-resolution nowcasts (precip type/intensity) to predict wait times per
      pad/tail with quantified uncertainty.
    - >-
      Optimization module that recommends pad assignments and push sequences to
      minimize TSAT/CTOT/EDCT misses subject to operational constraints (pad
      compatibility, taxi routing, HOT windows, runway config, airline
      priorities/SLA).
    - >-
      Holdover-time (HOT) risk scoring that anticipates expiry based on
      precip/type/temp/wind and treatment class; flags tails at risk and
      proposes expedited push or re-route to nearby pad.
    - >-
      What-if simulation for AOCC/deicing supervisors to test runway config
      changes, pad closures, truck reallocations, or snowband arrival; provides
      outcome deltas on TSAT adherence and throughput.
    - >-
      Role-specific interfaces and alerts: AOCC overview, deicing supervisor pad
      view, airline ramp-tail view, tower/CDM timeline cues; API/webhooks to
      push advisories into existing DMAN/A-CDM tools.
    - >-
      TSAT/EDCT protection logic: dynamic push-ready windows, pad exit
      sequencing, and DMAN updates to keep queues synchronized with airspace
      constraints.
    - >-
      Automated incident and KPI reporting: per-event performance (TSAT
      adherence, pad utilization, re-deice rate) with baselines for ROI
      tracking.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: airport VPC, on-prem edge gateway for
      surveillance feeds, and offline-degradation mode with cached models and
      manual override.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Protect TSAT/CTOT during winter ops by forecasting pad queues (5–180 min
    horizon) and optimizing pad assignments and push sequences—reducing TSAT
    misses 20–40%, increasing pad throughput 10–15%, and cutting re-deice events
    5–10% through holdover-aware, weather-driven AI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Holdover-aware, constraint-optimized engine trained on cross-airport deicing
    datasets and integrated with DMAN/A-CDM timelines, plus prebuilt connectors
    to SWIM/NM and major ops platforms—enabling faster, safer deployments and
    measurable TSAT protection that general surface tools or spreadsheets cannot
    match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Airport operations leaders, airline AOCC teams, and deicing coordinators who
    must keep departures flowing in winter while protecting TSAT/CTOT and
    safety.
  problem: >-
    When snow hits, deicing pad queues become unpredictable. Manual
    coordination, limited foresight, and data silos lead to missed TSAT/CTOT,
    pad gridlock, gate holds, wasted glycol, and cascading delays—turning a
    well-planned schedule into chaos.
  guide: >-
    We understand winter ops pressure. Our AI combines live ops data and weather
    with deicing rules to forecast pad queues and recommend pad assignments and
    push sequences. Safety-first, operator-in-the-loop, auditable, and easy to
    integrate with A-CDM, AODB, and deicing systems.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate AODB/flight data, deicing system, stands/pads, and
    METAR/TAF. 2) Configure: Define pad constraints, holdover logic, priorities,
    and slot rules. 3) Operate: Receive forecasts and TSAT-protecting pad/push
    advisories via dashboard/API; accept or override; feedback continuously
    improves. 4) Measure: Track OTP, TSAT/CTOT compliance, pad throughput,
    fuel/glycol savings.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a demo and launch a pilot at your winter base.
    Transitional: Request a winter-readiness assessment and sample forecasts
    using your historical data.
  success: >-
    Stable winter ops with protected TSAT/CTOT, higher pad throughput, fewer
    gate holds, smoother push sequences, reduced fuel and glycol use, lower
    emissions, calmer teams, and better OTP and passenger experience.
  failure: >-
    Keep gambling with winter: missed slots, cascading delays, pad gridlock,
    wasted glycol and overtime, frayed crews, heightened safety risk from rushed
    decisions, angry customers, and blown budgets.
