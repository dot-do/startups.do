  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers regularly miscalculate paint/wallpaper quantities, leading to
      under/over-buying, extra trips, and high return rates (often 10–20% of
      paint returns are quantity-related).
    - >-
      Retailers lack an automated, SKU-aware estimator that converts estimates
      into carts across web and in-store, leaving money on the table (lost
      conversion, low attach rates for tools/primers).
    - >-
      Associates spend 3–10 minutes per customer doing manual math; accuracy
      varies by experience and product coverage differences.
    - >-
      Existing calculators are generic, don’t account for product-specific
      coverage, primer needs, or wallpaper repeat/waste, and rarely integrate
      directly with inventory and POS/ecommerce carts.
    - >-
      Retailers struggle to quantify the ROI of calculators due to limited
      analytics linking estimations to sales, AOV, returns, and attachment of
      high-margin accessories.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered estimator that accepts simple room text (dimensions,
      doors/windows count) or 2–4 phone photos to calculate paint gallons,
      primer, wallpaper rolls (accounting for repeat/match), adhesives, tape,
      rollers/brushes, trays, drop cloths, and sundries.
    - >-
      Product-aware coverage engine that uses the retailer’s catalog (e.g.,
      different coverage by finish, substrate, VOC rules) and local inventory to
      output a cart-ready BOM with recommended upsells.
    - >-
      1-click push-to-cart for ecommerce; QR or short code handoff for in-store
      POS; associate mode to save 3–5 minutes per transaction.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard linking estimate sessions to carts, sales, AOV uplift,
      tool attach, and return rate reductions.
    - >-
      SDK/API and white-label widget for web, mobile, and associate
      tablets/kiosks; works offline for in-aisle mode and syncs when online.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase paint/wallpaper conversion and order accuracy by turning room
    photos or simple text inputs into a precise, SKU-aware bill of materials
    that auto-loads into the retailer’s cart—raising AOV by 8–15% and cutting
    quantity-related returns by 15–25%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    SKU-aware coverage and waste engine plus a growing proprietary dataset
    linking photos/text to accurate material usage, combined with push-to-cart
    integrations and closed-loop analytics tying estimates to sales and
    returns—creating a feedback moat competitors without retail integrations
    can’t easily replicate.
