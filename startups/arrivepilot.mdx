  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers spend 1–3 hours per day per 50 drivers handling WISMO (Where
      Is My Order) calls and manual delay outreach.
    - >-
      Customers receive vague or late delivery updates, leading to frustration,
      missed deliveries, and repeat calls.
    - >-
      Existing GPS/route tools show live position but lack proactive, contextual
      exception handling (re-promises, rescheduling).
    - >-
      ETAs for short-haul, urban routes are often off by 5–15 minutes due to
      traffic, parking, multi-stop variability, and building access — harming
      on-time performance.
    - >-
      Missed first-attempt deliveries (10–25% in dense urban areas) increase
      costs (re-delivery, overtime) and damage SLAs.
    - >-
      Smaller local courier firms lack resources to build compliant,
      multi-channel messaging (SMS/WhatsApp/email/voice) at scale with opt-ins,
      templates, and language support.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously compute per-stop ETA using GPS traces, traffic, stop context,
      and historical dwell times.
    - >-
      Detect exceptions automatically (late start, route deviation, prolonged
      dwell, geofence/parking issues, failed contact attempts).
    - >-
      Trigger proactive, branded messaging via SMS/WhatsApp/email/voice with
      dynamic re-promises or reschedule links.
    - >-
      Offer recipient self-service: live tracking page, confirm/leave-safe
      instructions, time window shift, or reroute to pickup lockers/alternates.
    - >-
      Provide dispatcher console with escalation workflows, override tools,
      two-way chat, and templated updates.
    - >-
      Deliver analytics on ETA accuracy, on-time %, WISMO reduction,
      first-attempt success, and SLA compliance by client/route/driver.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations with popular route/dispatch platforms and
      messaging providers; simple REST/webhook API and driver SDK.
    - >-
      Privacy-first, consent-managed communications with audit trails and
      optional healthcare BAA.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce WISMO and failed deliveries with an AI autopilot that predicts
    short-haul ETAs, detects delays early, and proactively messages recipients
    with clear re-promises and rescheduling options — fully branded, compliant,
    and integrated with your existing dispatch stack.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset and models specifically optimized for urban
    multi-stop courier patterns (parking, elevators, access codes), delivering
    measurably better short-haul ETA accuracy and earlier exception detection
    than general-purpose mapping ETAs, packaged with compliant, multi-channel
    autopilot flows and out-of-the-box integrations couriers already use.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Local messenger/courier companies (5–200 drivers) handling same-day and
      scheduled routes (retail, pharmacy, floral, parts).
    - >-
      Regional last‑mile carriers (200–2,000 drivers) with retail and healthcare
      clients needing SLAs and branded comms.
    - >-
      Route/dispatch platform vendors (Onfleet/Bringg/Tookan/etc.) seeking
      embedded ETA/comms modules via OEM/marketplace.
    - >-

      outbound, webinars focused on WISMO reduction ROI.
    - >-
      Partner with messaging providers (Twilio, MessageBird) and telematics
      (Samsara, Geotab) as a solution add-on.
    - >-
      Content SEO: playbooks for “courier ETA accuracy,” “reduce failed
      deliveries,” calculators for WISMO cost and missed-delivery ROI.
    - >-
      Pilot-led land-and-expand: 30-day trial in 1–2 depots; publish case
      studies with quantified results.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Local messengers, dispatchers, and delivery ops who want recipients
    confidently informed and routes on time—without manual texting.
  problem: >-
    Traffic, parking, and batching cause slips; manual ETAs are inconsistent;
    recipients are left in the dark, driving WISMO calls, driver interruptions,
    refunds, and bad reviews.
  guide: >-
    We understand last‑mile chaos and nonstop “Where is my order?” calls. Our AI
    turns live GPS into trustworthy ETAs and exception messaging—secure,
    on‑brand, and easy to deploy.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect GPS and orders via app/API. 2) Set rules, tone, and time windows.
    3) Go live—autopilot updates recipients, re‑promises ETAs, and offers
    rescheduling when needed.
  callToAction: Start a free pilot or book a 15‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    Calm dispatch, informed recipients, fewer support calls, protected SLAs,
    fewer refunds, higher CSAT and reviews, and more repeat business.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting: missed ETAs, angry calls, driver distractions, costly
    make‑goods, bad reviews, and churned clients.
