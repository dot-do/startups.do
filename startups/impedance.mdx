  problem:
    - >-
      Quote and CAM engineers spend 1–4 hours per RF/high‑speed PCB quote
      iterating stackups and impedance widths; back‑and‑forth with customers
      extends quote cycle times to 1–3 days, hurting win rates.
    - >-
      Field‑solver tools and generic calculators don’t capture fab‑specific
      process tolerances (etch, plating, press‑out, Dk variation), causing
      coupon failures and rework; first‑pass impedance coupon pass rates are
      often 80–90% instead of >98%.
    - >-
      Material data is scattered and inconsistent (supplier PDFs, varying Dk/Df
      vs frequency/temp); updating libraries and press recipes is manual and
      error‑prone.
    - >-
      Designers specify impractical stackups (exotic glass styles, impossible
      dielectric/foil combos), forcing redesign late in the cycle and eroding
      margins.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized, automated impedance coupon generation
      (Gerber/ODB++/IPC‑2581) leads to manual mistakes, extra CAM time, and test
      correlation issues.
    - >-
      Tolerance budgeting is rarely quantified at quote time; surprises during
      TDR test cause schedule slips and scrap.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to cost/lead‑time tradeoffs for alternative
      laminates/foil weights; opportunities to shift to equivalent, in‑stock
      materials are missed.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI optimizer generates manufacturable layer stacks that meet
      single‑ended/differential impedance targets with explicit tolerance
      analysis (etch, plating, dielectric, Dk/Df vs frequency/temp).
    - >-
      Fab‑specific capability models (press‑out, copper roughness, etch bias,
      lamination recipes) continuously calibrated against the fab’s TDR results
      for closed‑loop accuracy.
    - >-
      Comprehensive material library (Dk/Df vs frequency/temp/humidity, resin
      content, glass style) normalized across vendors; flags
      obsolete/out‑of‑stock items and suggests equivalents in inventory.
    - >-
      Automated coupon generator outputs Gerber X2/ODB++/IPC‑2581 with per‑panel
      coupon placement guidance and IPC‑TM‑650 2.5.5.x test method
      compatibility.
    - >-
      What‑if design: trade cost/lead‑time vs impedance tolerance; suggest
      alternate foils/dielectrics/glass styles to maintain targets with better
      availability.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins to EDA/CAM (Altium, Allegro, Xpedition, KiCad, Frontline
      InCAM/Genesis, Ucamco) to push/pull stackups and design rules.
    - >-
      Secure multi‑tenant cloud with optional on‑prem for ITAR/DFARS; audit
      logs, RBAC, SSO, SOC 2 roadmap.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI‑guided, fab‑calibrated stackups that hit target impedances the first
    time, with quantified tolerance budgets and ready‑to‑test coupons—cutting
    quote time by 50%+ and boosting coupon pass rate to >98%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed‑loop, fab‑calibrated models continuously trained on real coupon
    measurements across multiple process windows and materials—delivering
    prediction accuracy and tolerance realism competitors lack; coupled with
    designer plugins that create demand pull to participating fabs, forming a
    two‑sided network moat.
