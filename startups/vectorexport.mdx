  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone export classification and screening cause shipment
      delays (0.5–2 days on average) and risk of costly penalties (EAR/ITAR
      civil penalties can exceed $300k per violation).
    - >-
      High false-positive rates in denied-party screening (often 5–10%) create
      large review backlogs and missed ship dates.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows across ERP/WMS, forwarders, and email offer poor
      audit trails; assembling audit-ready documentation for each shipment is
      time-consuming (20–60 minutes per order).
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced export compliance staff; new rules (e.g.,
      Russia/Belarus, MEU/MEU-F/MEU-U) change frequently and are hard to track
      across lists (OFAC, BIS, DDTC, UN, EU).
    - >-
      Inconsistent HS/ECCN classification across SKUs and regions leads to
      rework, unnecessary license filings, and customer friction.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven SKU-to-HS/ECCN classification with human-in-the-loop
      verification for high-risk or low-confidence cases.
    - >-
      Automated denied/restricted party and sanctions screening of customers,
      consignees, end-users, and vessels with configurable risk thresholds and
      aliases/fuzzy matching.
    - >-
      License determination logic (EAR/ITAR) by destination, end-use/end-user,
      and de minimis calculations; flags potential MEU/600-series/USML risks.
    - >-
      Compliance packet generation including rationale with citations (CCL/USML
      paragraphs), screening logs, red-flag checklist, license decision path,
      and approver sign-off.
    - >-
      ERP/WMS and forwarder integration to screen at order entry, pick/pack, and
      shipment confirmation; API for custom workflows.
    - >-
      Change monitoring: near-real-time list updates and rule changes; alerts on
      impacted open orders and product catalogs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Explainable AI that pre-screens every order for HS/ECCN and denied parties,
    determines license needs, and produces an audit-ready compliance
    packet—cutting clearance time by 60–80% and reducing false positives by
    50–70% while integrating directly with your ERP and forwarder workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Feedback-fueled, explainable models tailored to transportation equipment
    parts—leveraging a growing proprietary corpus of SKU attributes, historical
    decisions, and audit outcomes unique to this vertical. Combined with
    pre-built ERP/forwarder connectors and attorney-reviewed decision trees,
    VectorExport AI delivers auditable rationale out-of-the-box that generalist
    screening tools and legacy GTS suites cannot replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transportation equipment and supplies (except motor vehicle) merchant
    wholesalers who need to ship cross-border without export-control mistakes.
  problem: >-
    External: Constantly changing HS/ECCN rules, EAR/ITAR carve‑outs, and global
    sanctions make manual checks slow and risky. Internal: Teams fear missing a
    red flag and delaying revenue. Philosophical: Legitimate trade shouldn’t be
    blocked by compliance complexity.
  guide: >-
    We understand trade-compliance pressure and the cost of delays. Our AI,
    trained on HS/ECCN logic and continuously updated sanctions/denied‑party
    lists, is validated by trade-compliance experts to give clear, auditable
    decisions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your ERP/order feed and product master. 2) The assistant
    pre‑screens HS/ECCN, sanctions, and denied parties; flags end‑use/end‑user
    risks; and generates a rationale-backed compliance packet. 3) Resolve
    exceptions with guided review and export the packet to your TMS/ERP for
    release.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 14‑day pilot or book a 30‑minute demo. Secondary: Upload one sample
    order for a free pre‑screen and compliance packet.
  success: >-
    Faster order release, fewer holds, and audit‑ready files. Confident HS/ECCN
    mapping, automated denied‑party/sanctions screening, and clear rationale
    reduce penalties risk and keep customers satisfied.
  failure: >-
    Without it: shipment holds or seizures, costly fines, last‑minute scrambles,
    lost deals, and reputational damage from compliance failures.
