  title: Least-Cost Feed Formulation and Re-optimization Agent
  description: >-
    Automatically generates and re-optimizes formulations for livestock,
    poultry, aquaculture, equine, and specialty feeds based on nutrient specs,
    market prices, and constraints.
  targetUsers:
    - Formulation/Nutrition teams
    - Plant managers
    - Procurement
  triggers:
    - Commodity price change > X% or new market close
    - New spec/SKU or regulatory change
    - Ingredient shortage/out-of-stock
  inputs:
    - Species/SKU nutrient targets and min/max constraints
    - 'Ingredient nutrient profiles (matrix, digestibility, energy)'
    - Current and forward ingredient prices
    - 'Processing constraints (pelletability/PDI, fat limit)'
    - Regulatory approvals per market
  steps:
    - Ingest latest prices and availability from market feeds and ERP
    - Validate ingredient matrices; impute gaps from libraries
    - Solve least-cost LP with safety margins and processing constraints
    - >-
      Run sensitivity analysis and produce alternative formulations (cost-risk
      tradeoffs)
    - Generate batch sheet and push BOM to ERP/MES; notify approver
  tools:
    - OR-Tools/PuLP for LP
    - USDA AMS/CME/Barchart/Quandl for price feeds
    - 'Excel/CSV/ERP API (e.g., SAP, Microsoft Dynamics)'
    - Gurobi/HiGHS (optional)
  outputs:
    - Approved formulation recipe with inclusions
    - 'Cost/ton, contribution margin, key nutrient margins'
    - Sensitivity chart; alternative mixes
    - Batch sheets and ERP BOM update
  pricingModel:
    - One-time setup + monthly subscription (per site/per SKU tier)
    - Optional success fee on realized cost savings

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Profit leakage from static formulations: many mills refresh rations weekly
      or monthly, missing daily commodity price movements and ingredient
      availability changes, leading to $0.50–$2.50/ton avoidable cost.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone workflows: spreadsheet-based LP models and siloed
      systems delay approvals, risk spec violations, and create
      audit/traceability gaps under FSMA/AAFCO.
    - >-
      Ingredient variability and quality risk: inconsistent nutrient profiles
      (e.g., DDGS, fishmeal, by-products) cause over-formulation and nutrient
      overage (1–3%), increasing cost and variability in animal performance.
    - >-
      Siloed procurement and formulation: poor alignment between purchasing,
      inventory, and production planning leads to stock-outs, rush purchases,
      and underutilized alternatives.
    - >-
      Limited scenario planning and risk management: tough to evaluate
      multi-plant, regional, or hedging scenarios quickly; decisions not robust
      to price/quality volatility.
    - >-
      Legacy software inertia: on-prem tools lack real-time data feeds,
      multi-objective optimization (cost + CO2 + risk), and modern APIs to
      integrate with ERP/MES/NIR labs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time least-cost and risk-aware re-optimization triggered by price,
      inventory, or quality events with automated recommendations and approvals.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization (cost, nutrient targets, CO2/LCAs, supplier
      constraints) supporting linear and non-linear specs across poultry, swine,
      ruminant, aquaculture, and equine.
    - >-
      Tight integrations: ERP/MES (orders, inventory), lab/NIR (as-fed nutrient
      updates), commodity market feeds, and EDI with suppliers.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if analysis: run portfolio-level simulations
      (plant, region, supplier) and sensitivity analyses; export to procurement
      and hedging teams.
    - >-
      Specification governance and labeling: centralized specs with versioning,
      audit trails, and regulatory/claim constraints (e.g., medication, non-GMO,
      region-specific).
    - >-
      QC and variability management: automatically update matrix values using
      rolling lab/NIR data, flag drift/outliers, and recommend overage
      reductions safely.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 6–8 week onboarding, dual-run with legacy tools,
      ROI validation, and user certification.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously optimized, audit-ready feed formulations that cut $/ton, reduce
    nutrient overages, and align procurement, quality, and production—delivered
    via a cloud-native LP/MIQP engine with live price/quality data and one-click
    re-optimization across species and plants.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving dataset and optimization layer that fuses live
    ingredient quality (NIR/lab) with market prices and plant constraints,
    enabling risk-aware, event-driven re-optimization that legacy tools and
    spreadsheets cannot match—backed by prebuilt ERP/MES/NIR connectors,
    validated dual-run migration tooling, and a team combining OR expertise with
    species nutrition depth.

  character: >-
    Feed mill managers, nutritionists, and formulators in Other Animal Food
    Manufacturing (NAICS 311119) who want to deliver compliant, high-performing
    rations for livestock, poultry, aquaculture, equine, and specialty species
    at the lowest possible cost—fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile ingredient prices, supply constraints, strict nutrient
    and label requirements, and production limits (pellet quality, moisture,
    throughput) across dozens of SKUs.

    - Internal: Legacy tools and spreadsheets are slow and error-prone;
    reformulating is tedious, risking missed savings and spec drift.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between nutrition, compliance,
    and margin—technology should make the best option obvious.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the daily pressure to hit specs, protect margin,
    and pivot with markets without disrupting production.

    - Authority: AI optimization built by feed formulation and operations
    experts; robust linear/MIP solvers; integrations with price feeds, lab
    analyses, and ERP; audit trails, scenario planning, and enterprise-grade
    security.
  plan: |-
    - Process plan:
      1) Connect data: prices, nutrient matrices, inventory, specs, and constraints.
      2) Configure species/life-stage formulas and operational guardrails.
      3) Run least-cost optimization and scenario analyses with production constraints.
      4) Approve and publish formulas to ERP/mill with labels and QA checks.
      5) Auto re-optimize on price or availability changes, with alerts and version control.
    - Agreement plan:
      - Start with a focused pilot (5–10 SKUs) with clear success metrics (cost/ton, compliance rate, time-to-reformulate).
      - Your data stays yours; SOC 2, RBAC, and auditability included.
      - SLA-backed support; scale only after ROI is demonstrated.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct CTA: Schedule a demo; start a 30-day pilot; submit a current
    formula for an instant least-cost comparison.

    - Transitional CTA: Download the ROI calculator; get a formulation audit
    checklist; access a sandbox with sample data.
  success: >-
    - Lower cost per ton and improved margin without sacrificing performance or
    compliance.

    - Faster formulation cycles and continuous re-optimization as markets move.

    - Higher spec adherence with transparent constraints and audit trails.

    - Confident, data-driven decisions with scenario planning and
    production-ready outputs.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing overspend from missed price opportunities and suboptimal blends.

    - Spec violations, label risk, and production disruptions from manual
    errors.

    - Slow response to market volatility, wasted analyst time, and lost
    competitive bids.
