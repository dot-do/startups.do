  problem:
    - >-
      Manual diffing of structural drawings and models takes 6–12 hours per
      revision set for a mid-size project and still misses changes hidden in
      notes or schedules, leading to 1–3% margin erosion on steel/precast
      packages.
    - >-
      Change order cycle time is slow (typical 14–45 days from revision to
      approved CO), tying up cash and creating dispute risk; contractors need
      quantified deltas within 24–48 hours to preserve claim timelines.
    - >-
      Quantity and tonnage impacts are error-prone when derived from 2D PDFs;
      detailers and PMs often rely on spot checks rather than exhaustive
      comparisons across sheets, models, and schedules.
    - >-
      Precast panel geometry, embed locations, strand patterns, and connection
      hardware frequently change between revisions; missed items cause
      fabrication rework, field fixes, and backcharges.
    - >-
      Steel connection changes (bolt patterns, hole sizes, weld vs bolt,
      baseplate thickness/anchor bolt layouts) are hard to detect across notes,
      details, and schedules, not just plan/section graphics.
    - >-
      Lack of an audit-ready trail (overlay visuals tied to line-item quantity
      changes) weakens negotiation during CO review with GCs/owners and in
      potential disputes.
    - >-
      Existing tools compare pixels or models but rarely translate changes into
      contractor-ready quantities (tonnage, piece counts, embeds, anchors) with
      cost mapping to shop/field labor.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across PDFs (revisions clouds, delta notes),
      IFC/RVT/Tekla models, and spec addenda makes version alignment and
      baselining inconsistent, slowing down reviews.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated multi-source ingest: PDFs (plan/elevation/details), BIM
      (IFC/RVT/Tekla), and spec addenda with robust version alignment and
      baselining.
    - >-
      Revision delta engine: computer vision + geometry parsing + NLP to detect
      and classify changes across graphics, notes, schedules, and title blocks;
      links to specific callouts and details.
    - >-
      Trade-specific quantification: converts detected changes into structural
      steel tonnage, piece counts by profile/size, connection hardware changes;
      and precast panel geometry, reinforcement/strand changes, embeds, and
      connection hardware deltas.
    - >-
      Cost impact estimator: maps quantity deltas to configurable production
      rates, shop/field labor, and material rates; outputs line-item ROMs with
      sensitivity ranges and risk flags.
    - >-
      Evidence and reporting: 2D/3D overlays, clickable change list, CSV/Excel
      exports, and CO-ready summaries; full traceability for audits/disputes.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Bluebeam,
      Tekla Structures/EPM, SDS2, STRUMIS via API and app-store connectors.
    - >-
      Security and collaboration: project-based permissions, immutable
      baselines, reviewer tasks/approvals, SOC 2-aligned controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered revision-to-revision diff that turns drawing/model/spec changes
    into contractor-ready line items (tonnage, piece counts, panels, embeds,
    anchors) with estimated cost impact in minutes, not days—integrated into
    steel/precast workflows and supported by audit-ready overlays and traceable
    evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A defensible, growing dataset of revision-change-to-quantity mappings for
    steel/precast and embedded trade-specific heuristics that general-purpose
    compare tools lack, combined with deep workflow integrations
    (Tekla/Procore/Bluebeam) and an audit-ready evidence trail that shortens CO
    cycles and strengthens negotiation leverage.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Structural steel and precast concrete contractors who need to instantly see
    what changed between spec/drawing revisions so they can protect scope, price
    accurately, and keep projects on schedule.
  problem: >-
    - External: Frequent revisions and addenda hide scope deltas across sheets
    and spec sections.

    - Internal: Teams burn hours combing PDFs and still miss impacts, risking
    rework and margin.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose money because design churn is hard to
    track.
  guide: >-
    We understand steel and precast workflows—estimating, detailing,
    fabrication, and erection. Built with input from fabricators, detailers, and
    PMs, our AI is tuned to AISC/PCI conventions and produces clear,
    audit-friendly outputs.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Upload baseline and revised drawings/specs (PDF/DWG/IFC).

    - Step 2: AI flags deltas by sheet, callout, and spec clause; estimates
    quantity/tonnage, embeds, connections, and erection impacts.

    - Step 3: Review and adjust assumptions, then export a priced change
    log/report to CSV/PDF or push to your estimating/ERP.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot on your next revision set.
    Transitional: Download a sample change-impact report.
  success: >-
    Capture billable changes you’d otherwise miss, price change events faster
    with defensible quantities/tonnage, protect margin, shorten approval cycles
    with a clear audit trail, and keep detailing/fabrication on track.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you’ll keep doing manual diffs, miss hidden scope, underprice
    change orders, absorb costs, invite disputes, and slip schedules.
