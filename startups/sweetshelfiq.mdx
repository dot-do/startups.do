  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesaler category managers spend 10–20 hours per retailer reset
      assembling SKU lists and planograms from spreadsheets, PDFs, and legacy
      tools.
    - >-
      Seasonality in confectionery (Valentine’s, Easter, Halloween, Holiday)
      causes frequent mismatches between DC inventory, retailer shelf space, and
      consumer demand, resulting in 5–10% lost sales and high markdowns.
    - >-
      One-size-fits-all assortments ignore retailer type, region, and shelf
      constraints; small-format retailers (2–4 ft candy sets) are underserved.
    - >-
      Planogram proposals often lack defensible analytics (velocity, margin,
      promo calendar), lowering retailer acceptance rates below 50%.
    - >-
      Compliance and execution gaps (no store-level plan) cause out-of-stocks
      and facing errors; post-reset audits show 20–30% non-compliance.
    - >-
      Wholesalers lack integrated visibility across syndicated data
      (NIQ/Circana), POS, DC inventory, and manufacturer promotions, slowing
      responses to retailer RFPs by 1–2 weeks.
    - >-
      Temperature and melt risk (summer chocolate) and adjacency rules are not
      systematically applied, leading to waste and poor shopper experience.
    - >-
      New item introductions and SKU rationalization are guesswork, causing
      proliferation without incremental sales or margin gains.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven assortment optimization using velocity, margin dollars, DC
      inventory, and promotional uplift models per retailer format and season.
    - >-
      Auto-generated basic planograms (e.g., 2–8 ft shelf, peg/shelf mix) with
      constraints for facings, adjacency, pack type, and temperature/melt risk
      by region/time.
    - >-
      Seasonal switch-over builder that maps everyday→seasonal→everyday, with DC
      depletion plans and markdown minimization.
    - >-
      Retailer-ready proposal packs (PDF/PowerPoint export) with rationale:
      expected sales lift, GM$, turns, OOS reduction, and new-item
      justifications.
    - >-
      Integration to wholesaler data (ERP/OMS/DC inventory), syndicated data
      (NIQ/Circana), and retailer POS where available; export to JDA/Blue
      Yonder, NIQ Spaceman, and DotActiv.
    - >-
      Compliance toolkit: printable planograms, shelf tags/UPC lists, and a
      mobile checklist; optional photo-based audits via partner.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: post-implementation readouts compare forecast vs
      actual and refine rules.
    - >-
      API-first architecture for partners (manufacturers, brokers) to co-author
      proposals with the wholesaler.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase retailer acceptance and sales lift with AI-generated, data-backed
    assortments and basic planograms tailored to retailer type, season, and
    shelf space—delivered in minutes, aligned to DC inventory and promo
    calendars.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Confectionery-specific models and taxonomy (season codes, melt risk,
    adjacency rules) trained on multi-season data; integrations that align
    assortments with DC inventory and promo funding; partnerships with
    manufacturers and space-planning vendors to co-sell and drive retailer
    acceptance; growing benchmark dataset that improves recommendations and
    proposal credibility.
