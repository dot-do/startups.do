  problem:
    - >-
      Manual restoration (noise, hum, reverb, clipping) is slow (1–3x
      program-time) and requires scarce specialists, creating backlogs for post
      houses, archives, and forensic labs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent results across operators and tools; lack of standardized,
      measurable quality metrics hampers QA and client approvals.
    - >-
      Forensic workflows require strict chain-of-custody, audit logs, and
      reproducibility; most AI tools lack defensibility for courtroom use.
    - >-
      Batch processing for large archives and podcast networks is cumbersome;
      existing tools are tuned for interactive, single-file work.
    - >-
      Cloud AI services raise privacy/security concerns for sensitive
      law-enforcement, legal, and pre-release media without on‑prem or VPC
      options.
    - >-
      Budgets are squeezed; premium tools (e.g., high-end hardware restorers)
      are expensive or inflexible, limiting access for smaller facilities and
      institutions.
  solution:
    - >-
      End-to-end AI restoration pipeline: dereverb, dehum, denoise, declip,
      de-wind/plosive, spectral repair, voice isolation, and loudness
      conformance.
    - >-
      Delivery modes: Pro Tools/AAX, VST3, AU plug‑ins; browser app; REST
      API/CLI; and on‑prem/VPC deployment for secure/sensitive workloads.
    - >-
      Forensic chain-of-custody: immutable audit logs, parameter/version
      pinning, deterministic seeds, cryptographic hashes, and PDF/JSON reports
      suitable for evidentiary use.
    - >-
      Batch and watch‑folder automation for archives/podcasts with presets and
      QC gates; timecode/metadata preservation (BWF/iXML).
    - >-
      Objective pre/post analytics: SNR, SI‑SDR, PESQ/STOI deltas; ASR WER delta
      on speech tracks; loudness and true-peak conformance to EBU R128/ATSC
      A/85.
    - >-
      Admin and enterprise features: SSO/SAML, RBAC, project billing, usage
      quotas, SOC 2-aligned controls; CJIS-aligned on‑prem option for LE use
      cases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forensic‑grade AI audio cleanup that delivers measurable quality
    improvements, 5–10x faster throughput, and defensible, auditable
    workflows—available via API, plug‑ins, web app, or secure on‑prem
    appliances.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Forensic‑grade auditability and reproducibility baked into the AI pipeline
    (chain‑of‑custody, deterministic runs, cryptographic logs), combined with
    dialogue‑focused models trained on real‑world field and law‑enforcement‑like
    noise profiles and deployable securely on‑prem or VPC—capabilities
    competitors lack in a single, integrated offering.

    title: AI Audio Restoration & Forensics Cleanup
    subtitle: >-
      Remove noise, hum, reverb, and clipping from archival, dialogue, and field
      recordings—fast, consistent, and secure.
    ctaText: Start Free
    ctaHref: '#get-started'
  problem:
    - Noisy field recordings bury key details and voices.
    - 'Hum, buzz, and HVAC make speech hard to understand.'
    - Room echo turns usable dialog into mush.
    - Clipped peaks distort critical moments.
    - 'Manual cleanup is slow, subjective, and hard to scale.'
    - 'Legacy tapes and fragile media require careful, consistent treatment.'
  solution:
    - Speech-first enhancement that preserves tone while removing noise.
    - Targeted de-hum and de-reverb tuned for archival and dialog material.
    - Intelligent declipping reconstructs peaks for clearer intelligibility.
    - Batch processing and API integrate into existing post pipelines.
    - Forensic-friendly workflow with audit logs and immutable originals.
    - Secure cloud or on‑prem options with end‑to‑end encryption.
  features:
    - Voice‑aware broadband and tonal noise reduction.
    - Adaptive de‑reverb with room profile estimation.
    - Hum/buzz removal with automatic fundamental detection.
    - Phase‑aware declipping and transient repair.
    - 'Spectral repair for clicks, pops, rustle, and dropouts.'
    - Dialog isolate and ambience match tools.
    - Timecode‑aware processing; BWF/metadata preservation.
    - 'Batch ingest: WAV, BWF, AIFF, FLAC, MP3.'
    - REST API and VST/AU plugin options.
    - A/B real‑time preview and per‑file change history.
    - 'Chain‑of‑custody mode: hashing, audit logs, read‑only originals.'
    - 'Processing reports with before/after metrics (e.g., SNR, LUFS).'
    - GPU‑accelerated queues with priority lanes for rush jobs.
  steps:
    - Upload files or connect your storage bucket.
    - 'Pick a profile: Archival, Dialogue, Field, or Forensics.'
    - 'Set targets for noise, hum frequency, reverb level, and clipping repair.'
    - Preview on a segment with instant A/B comparison.
    - Run batch processing or send directly to your DAW via plugin/API.
    - Download cleaned files with reports; originals remain untouched.
