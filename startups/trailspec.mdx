  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers and OEM sales teams cannot reliably validate custom configurations
      against engineering and supply constraints in real time, causing quote
      delays of 24–72 hours and lost deals.
    - >-
      Option conflicts and BOM errors result in rework (3–8% of orders) and
      margin leakage due to manual overrides and Excel-based quoting.
    - >-
      Commodity volatility (aluminum, steel, plywood, foam, adhesives) and
      freight surcharges are not reflected in dealer quotes quickly, producing
      1–3% margin variance vs target.
    - >-
      Supply constraints (e.g., AC units, axles, refrigerators) are not visible
      at quote time, leading to missed promised lead times and cancellations.
    - >-
      Legacy CPQ/ERP setups lack RV-specific constraint logic (floorplan,
      chassis, weight, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, payload), driving heavy
      engineering involvement per quote.
    - >-
      Dealer and brand websites lack a unified, rules-aware configurator;
      inconsistent quoting experience depresses conversion and increases price
      discounting.
  solution:
    - >-
      RV-specific constraints engine that validates floorplans, chassis,
      weights, electrical loads, HVAC capacity, plumbing, axle/tire ratings, and
      safety codes during configuration.
    - >-
      Real-time cost model that rolls up BOM + labor using live commodity
      indices (aluminum, steel, lumber/plywood, foam) and supplier catalogs;
      auto-updates surcharges and freight.
    - >-
      Supplier availability and lead-time feeds (via vendor portal/API) to
      dynamically allow/deny options and estimate ship dates.
    - >-
      Dealer-facing configurator UI and embeddable components; supports
      multi-brand catalogs, guided selling, and offline trade show mode with
      local cache.
    - >-
      Margin guardrails and price governance: target-costing, price
      floors/ceilings, approval workflows, and elastic pricing based on demand
      and component scarcity.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP (Infor CSI/SyteLine, Epicor Kinetic, Plex, Microsoft
      D365), PLM/CAD (SolidWorks, Autodesk, Siemens), DMS (IDS, Lightspeed).
    - >-
      Analytics: quote-to-order conversion, option attach trends, margin
      variance, lead-time accuracy; scenario planning for option bundles and
      promotions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, RV-specific configuration validation and supply-aware pricing
    that produces buildable quotes in seconds, protects margins with dynamic
    cost roll-ups, and integrates seamlessly with OEM ERP/PLM and dealer
    portals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    An RV-specific constraints and pricing knowledge base fed by live supplier
    availability, commodity indices, and anonymized historical order data across
    multiple OEMs, delivered via a low-latency engine and pre-built
    integrations—enabling accurate, buildable, margin-guardrailed quotes in
    seconds that generic CPQ tools and spreadsheets cannot match.

  problem:
    - >-
      Quotes include options that can’t be built (weight, axle, electrical,
