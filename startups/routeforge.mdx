  problem:
    - >-
      Manual planning for last-/mid-mile routes takes 2–6 hours daily per
      dispatcher and does not scale with demand volatility.
    - >-
      Missed time windows and SLA breaches (5–15%) cause refund credits, lost
      contracts, and lower NPS.
    - >-
      Under/over-utilized vehicles increase cost per stop; typical fleets drive
      10–25% more miles than necessary.
    - >-
      Real-time disruptions (late pickups, traffic, cancellations) require
      re-planning; most tools cannot re-optimize mid-shift in seconds.
    - >-
      Data silos across OMS/WMS/TMS/telematics block accurate ETAs and capacity
      planning.
    - >-
      Compliance with driver shifts/HOS, vehicle restrictions, and customer
      constraints is difficult to encode and audit.
    - >-
      SMB/mid-market fleets lack data science resources to tune solvers,
      forecast service times, and quantify ROI.
    - >-
      Sustainability targets (CO2 per stop) lack operational levers without
      optimized routing and consolidation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud SaaS + API for daily and intra-day Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
      with time windows, capacities, skills, pickup-delivery, and multi-depot.
    - >-

      exception queue, and one-click re-optimization.
    - >-
      Driver app SDK/integrations for turn-by-turn navigation, barcode/PoD
      capture, and on-device stop confirmations.
    - >-
      Explainable solver: shows constraint trade-offs (e.g., why a stop moved)
      and quantifies KPI impact of overrides.
    - >-
      Scenario Studio: what-if planning (add vehicles, change depot hours,
      simulate traffic) with A/B KPI comparison.
    - >-
      Streaming ETA engine using historical and live traffic; learns
      location-specific service times automatically.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops leaders, dispatchers, and logistics consultants at parcel, retail,
    field-service, and 3PL fleets who must plan daily last-/mid-mile routes
    within time windows, capacities, and driver shifts.
  problem: >-
    Manual, spreadsheet-based planning can’t keep pace with volatile demand and
    complex constraints—causing late deliveries, empty miles, overtime, and
    missed SLAs.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit on-time and cost targets. Our team blends
    process/logistics consulting with production-grade VRP and AI proven on
    millions of stops.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders, drivers, and depots via API/CSV; 2) Set rules—time
    windows, capacities, skills, shifts, priorities; 3) Auto-generate, dispatch,
    and re-optimize routes with live tracking and KPIs.
  callToAction: Book a 15-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot.
  success: >-
    Planning time down 90%, miles down 10–25%, on-time 98%+, higher utilization,
    lower cost per stop, happier drivers and customers.
  failure: >-
    Persisting with manual planning leads to SLA misses, excess fuel and
    overtime, underutilized fleets, customer churn, and planner burnout.
