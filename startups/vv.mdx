leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone V&V documentation: Protocols and reports are largely
      authored in Word/Excel, taking 20–80 hours per product release and
      creating version control risk.
    - >-
      Traceability gaps: Maintaining bidirectional links across requirements
      (URS/SRS), risks (ISO 14971), tests, and results is labor-intensive,
      leading to missing coverage and audit findings.
    - >-
      Inconsistent test quality and reuse: Teams reinvent tests per project;
      best practices are tribal knowledge; templates are not standardized across
      product lines and geographies.
    - >-
      Audit readiness pain: Preparing DHF/DTF deliverables (trace matrix, test
      reports, deviation logs) for FDA/ISO audits can take 2–6 weeks and often
      reveals gaps late.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools and data silos: Requirements in Jama/DOORS, issues in
      Jira, tests in TestRail/ALM, results in PDFs/CSV/LIMS—no single source of
      truth for validation.
    - >-
      21 CFR Part 11 and e-signature friction: Collecting compliant approvals,
      audit trails, and controlled changes across tools is complex.
    - >-
      High cost of deviations: Poorly scoped tests and late defect discovery
      cause rework, launch delays, and CAPAs that can cost $50k–$500k per
      incident.
    - >-
      Scale challenges: As portfolios expand (new models/variants), V&V cycles
      don’t scale; validating firmware/software-heavy instruments strains teams.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI protocol generator: Convert requirements and risk files (Jama/DOORS
      exports, PDFs, CSV) into traceable protocols with pre-linked tests and
      acceptance criteria.
    - >-
      Risk- and standards-aware templates: Domain-tuned templates for
      spectrometry, chromatography, balances, titrators, thermal analyzers,
      etc., aligned to ISO 9001/13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304 (when applicable),
      and GAMP 5 principles.
    - >-
      Results/deviation summarizer: Ingest executed test evidence (attachments,
      logs, CSV, images) to auto-generate V&V summary reports, deviation
      classifications, root-cause hints, and CAPA candidates.
    - >-
      Live traceability matrix: Always-current coverage across requirements,
      risks, tests, results, and deviations; heatmaps for gaps and change impact
      analysis.
    - >-
      Connectors: Jama, Polarion, DOORS, Jira, TestRail/Zephyr,
      ValGenesis/Kneat/Greenlight Guru, Arena PLM, LabWare/Benchling LIMS/ELN;
      SSO/SAML; DocuSign Part 11.
    - >-
      Governance and e-signatures: Role-based reviews, dual e-signatures, and
      immutable audit trail; change requests with controlled baselines.
    - >-
      Deployment options: Secure SaaS and private VPC/on-prem modules for
      regulated clients; validated installation/operational qualification
      (IQ/OQ) for our own software.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop and guardrails: Redlines, comment workflows,
      hallucination controls, citation to source requirements, and confidence
      scores.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate auditor-ready, traceable V&V protocols and result summaries in
    minutes—not weeks—while maintaining end-to-end requirements–risk–test–result
    coverage with 21 CFR Part 11-compliant audit trails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    analytical instrument V&V artifacts and risk mappings, combined with
    pre-approved templates and deep integrations into regulated
