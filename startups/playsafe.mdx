  problem:
    - >-
      Retailer and marketplace templates (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Michaels,
      Hobby Lobby, Joann, etc.) change frequently, causing 10–30% listing
      rejections and multi-day delays when attributes and warnings are missing
      or mis-mapped.
    - >-
      CPSIA/ASTM F963/Prop 65 compliance data lives in PDFs (lab reports, BOMs,
      SDS) and packaging images; extracting age grading, small-parts, battery,
      chemical warnings, and tracking labels is manual, error-prone, and slow.
    - >-
      Seasonal SKU spikes (pre-holiday) overwhelm item setup teams; onboarding a
      new line can take 3–10 days/SKU across channels.
    - >-
      Chargebacks, retailer penalties, or CBP detentions arise from
      missing/mislabeled warnings and documents; visibility into compliance
      readiness is poor.
    - >-
      Images fail channel-specific rules (warning icon placement, backgrounds,
      dimensions, aspect ratios), triggering rework and lost buy-box time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion of PDFs (lab reports, BOMs, SDS), spreadsheets, PIM/ERP
      exports, and packaging images; OCR + computer vision to locate safety
      statements and icons.
    - >-
      CPSIA/ASTM/Prop 65 rules engine + fine-tuned models to extract age
      grading, small parts, battery type, tracking label, chemical warnings, and
      generate required statements and icons.
    - >-
      Auto-mapping to a maintained library of 200+ retailer/marketplace
      templates with continuous spec change monitoring and versioning.
    - >-
      Image compliance toolkit: auto-generate channel-specific image sets with
      warning overlays, size/aspect normalization, background fixes, and icon
      placement per template.
    - >-
      Pre-flight validator: simulate retailer acceptance, flag missing
      fields/assets, and provide fix suggestions; export EDI/Excel/XML/API
      payloads per channel.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA for edge cases with audit trails linking attributes
      to source evidence (PDF page coordinates, image snippets).
    - >-
      Connectors/APIs for Salsify, Syndigo, 1WorldSync, ChannelAdvisor,
      CommerceHub, SPS, Shopify/BigCommerce, and major ERPs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Transform raw item data into retailer-ready listings with verified CPSIA
    safety attributes and compliant images in hours, not days—cutting
    time-to-listing by 80% and achieving >98% first-pass acceptance while
    reducing chargebacks and compliance risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific CPSIA expertise embedded in models and rules, plus a
    proprietary retailer template library continuously updated from real
    acceptance outcomes. Evidence-linked attributes and an audit-ready trail
    reduce retailer friction and legal risk. Lab partnerships enable direct
    ingestion of test data at the source. Predictive acceptance scoring and a
    “compliance guarantee” (credit SKUs that fail due to our mappings) build
    trust competitors struggle to match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and eCommerce leaders at toy and hobby goods wholesalers who must
    publish compliant, complete, conversion-ready listings across multiple
    retailers and marketplaces.
  problem: >-
    External: Missing CPSIA attributes, age grading, and warnings plus
    inconsistent images cause listing rejections, chargebacks, and delays.
    Internal: Teams are stretched, rules change by channel, and manual
    enrichment is slow and error-prone. Philosophical: Safe, accurate product
    data should never be a barrier to selling great toys.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know how one missing warning or attribute can derail a launch
    and hurt retailer scorecards. Authority: Toy-focused AI trained on
    CPSIA/ASTM F963, age grading, battery and choking hazard rules, and major
    retailer templates (Amazon, Walmart, Target, specialty). Mappings,
    validations, and audit-ready outputs built for compliance teams.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your catalog (CSV/PIM/ERP) and select target channels. 2) AI
    enriches titles, bullets, safety attributes and warnings, and aligns images
    to each retailer template; validates against CPSIA and channel schemas;
    flags gaps. 3) Review and approve; export/push channel-ready feeds; ongoing
    monitoring and updates with optional managed service and SLAs.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 50‑SKU pilot this week; or request a free two‑SKU compliance check
    and book a 15‑minute fit call.
  success: >-
    Channel-ready listings that pass on first submission; faster onboarding
    (days, not weeks); fewer rejections and chargebacks; higher conversion from
    richer content; centralized CPSIA audit trail; confident, scalable
    syndication to every channel.
  failure: >-
    Without this, expect recurring listing denials, scorecard hits, penalties,
    manual rework, missed launch windows, lost sales, and elevated compliance
    risk leading to delistings or recalls.
