  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned conveyor downtime is driven by stockouts of critical parts
      (motors, gearboxes, belts, bearings, sensors) with lumpy demand and
      volatile supplier lead-times (8–26+ weeks for many SKUs).
    - >-
      Static ERP min/max and human heuristics fail under variability; reorder
      points rarely update, causing 10–30% annual stockout incidence on critical
      SKUs per site.
    - >-
      Overstocking ties up 20–40% excess working capital in slow-moving spares;
      obsolescence and write-offs are common (2–5%/yr).
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge and incomplete BOMs make it hard to identify true
      criticality; inconsistent kitting leads to incomplete maintenance jobs and
      rework.
    - >-
      Supplier risk (capacity constraints, allocations, obsolescence) is opaque;
      buyers lack predictive signals to hedge or multi-source in time.
    - >-
      Distributed networks (multiple plants/DCs) can’t see cross-site pools,
      causing avoidable expediting costs and missed lateral transfers.
    - >-
      VMI programs optimize for distributor turns, not line uptime risk;
      visibility into service levels and lead-time variability is limited.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest ERP/CMMS/PO history and BOMs; cleanse and map to a
      conveyor-specific parts ontology (motors, drives, idlers, belts, bearings,
      sensors).
    - >-
      Predict supplier/part lead-time distributions and variability; flag
      obsolescence and single-source risk.
    - >-
      Quantify risk-adjusted criticality (ABC/XYZ + VED + downtime cost) per
      part and line; compute dynamic safety stock/min–max with target service
      levels.
    - >-
      Recommend and auto-maintain PM and breakdown kits; ensure kit completeness
      with pick lists and barcode checks.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator for service level vs. working capital vs. downtime
      trade-offs; what-if for demand surges, supplier delays, and consolidation.
    - >-
      Auto-replenishment triggers to ERP/CMMS; integrate with distributors for
      EDI/PO and with marketplaces for alternatives and cross-refs.
    - >-
      Cross-site pooling and transfer recommendations with time-to-need vs.
      ship-time logic.
    - >-
      Supplier risk dashboard (capacity/late PO signals) and hedging playbook:
      forward buys, multi-source, expedite thresholds.
    - >-
      Telemetry option: use PLC/runtime hours to adjust demand priors for wear
      parts (belts, rollers, bearings).
    - >-
      ROI tracker: downtime hours avoided, stockouts prevented, inventory freed,
      expedite costs avoided.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce conveyor downtime and MRO working capital with an AI that sets
    dynamic min/max, safety stock, and kitted spares based on real demand and
    lead-time risk—delivering 98–99.5% service levels on critical parts with
    15–25% inventory reduction and measurable downtime avoidance within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Conveyor-specific data assets (BOM/parts ontology, cross-OEM lead-time and
    failure priors) and prebuilt integrations enable accurate risk-adjusted
    stocking within weeks, not months. Network effects improve forecasts as more
    sites onboard. OEM/distributor co-sell relationships and white-label options
    embed us at point of sale and retrofit, making displacement difficult.

  character: >-
    Operations, maintenance, and supply chain leaders at conveyor and conveying
    equipment manufacturers (NAICS 333922) who must keep lines running while
    controlling spare-parts inventory and cash.
  problem: >-
    Villain: volatile supplier lead times and supply hiccups. External: missing
    critical spares causes unplanned downtime and missed ship dates. Internal:
    constant firefighting, stress, and finger-pointing. Philosophical:
    production should never be held hostage by parts availability.
  guide: >-
    We understand every hour of a stopped conveyor is expensive. Our AI analyzes
    ERP/CMMS data, BOM criticality, usage variability, MTBF, and supplier lead
    times to set evidence-based min/max levels and build ready-to-pull
    maintenance kits. Trusted by manufacturers to cut stockouts, expedites, and
    premium freight.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/CMMS and supplier data to baseline risk. 2) Optimize min/max
    and kitting by line and criticality; align reorder points and suppliers. 3)
    Pilot on one line, then automate alerts and replenishment with monthly
    reviews.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute Spare Parts Risk Assessment and get a pilot plus ROI
    estimate.
  success: >-
    Predictable uptime, 95–99% service levels on critical spares, 30–60% fewer
    expedites and premium freight, faster maintenance with ready kits, optimized
    inventory and cash, stronger on-time delivery and reputation.
  failure: >-
    Stockouts persist, lines stop, costs spike with overtime and premium
    freight, teams burn out, and customers lose trust.
