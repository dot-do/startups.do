leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers (NAICS 459920) risk buying or consigning forgeries, stolen works,
      or items with encumbered title; a single bad acquisition can cause
      six‑figure losses and reputational damage.
    - >-
      Manual diligence (image searches, catalogues raisonnés, multiple
      stolen‑art registries, provenance checks) is fragmented and slow (1–3
      hours per work) and often skipped under deadline pressure.
    - >-
      Existing databases (e.g., stolen‑art lists) are siloed and require manual
      search, do not handle look‑alike images, and rarely contextualize
      provenance gaps or anomalies.
    - >-
      Growing compliance and counterpart‑risk expectations (EU/UK AML;
      institutional buyers’ KYC policies in the US) are pushing dealers to
      document diligence even when no legal requirement exists.
    - >-
      Small and mid‑size dealers lack in‑house research staff and need
      affordable, fast, non‑legal risk triage to decide when to escalate to an
      expert.
  solution:
    - >-
      One‑click Screening: Upload/point to images and provenance text; receive a
      risk score (0–100) with specific flags in under 5 seconds (p95 < 10s).
    - >-
      Cross‑Registry Checks: Automated queries across public stolen‑art lists
      (e.g., INTERPOL, FBI, national databases) and optional paid connectors via
      partner APIs, with pass‑through fees.
    - >-
      Image Similarity & Look‑Alikes: Computer vision finds potential matches
      despite cropping, lighting, or condition changes; highlights
      signature/mark anomalies.
    - >-
      Provenance Intelligence: NLP extracts owners, dates, locations; graph
      analysis spots gaps (e.g., >5‑year unexplained gap), WWII‑era risk
      windows, implausible chains, or circular references.
    - >-
      Evidence Pack: Downloadable PDF/JSON with flags, sources, matched images,
      and a standardized “Non‑Legal Preliminary Risk Screen” disclaimer to share
      with clients/insurers.
    - >-
      Workflow Integration: API and plug‑ins for common dealer inventory
      systems; batch screening for new consignments; watchlists and
      auto‑rescreening alerts.
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑Loop: Escalation to an internal research analyst panel or
      external experts when high‑risk flags trigger, with SLAs (24–72 hours) for
      deeper non‑legal review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, non‑legal early‑warning flags before you commit to inventory or
    consignment—combining image similarity, stolen‑art cross‑checks, and
    AI‑detected provenance anomalies—documented in an auditable report and
    integrated into dealer workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, privacy‑preserving dataset combining
    dealer‑supplied images with public/partner data, tuned CV/NLP models for
    art‑specific edge cases (condition changes, catalog references, multilingual
    provenance), and embedded integrations into dealer inventory tools—creating
    switching costs and superior recall with explainability. Early insurer
    endorsements further entrench adoption.
