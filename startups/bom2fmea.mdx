  problem:
    - >-
      Creating FMEA/PFMEA from scratch is slow (2–6 weeks) and labor-intensive,
      delaying NPI gate reviews and PPAP-like approvals.
    - >-
      Quality and reliability teams struggle to translate BoMs and routings into
      structured failure modes and controls consistently across sites.
    - >-
      Severity/occurrence/detection rankings are subjective and inconsistent,
      leading to wide variability in RPN/AP values and audit findings.
    - >-
      Control plans are often misaligned with PFMEA, causing gaps between
      identified risks and on-the-floor checks/MSA.
    - >-
      Existing FMEA tools are documentation-centric with poor integration to
      PLM/MES/ERP, resulting in manual re-entry and version drift.
    - >-
      Suppliers face repeated, similar FMEAs across product variants and
      programs, but knowledge isn’t reused effectively.
    - >-
      Audit and customer requirements (ISO 9001, AS9100, UL/NFPA for
      signaling/alarm equipment, defense program FMECAs) demand traceability
      that’s expensive to maintain.
    - >-
      Contract manufacturers need fast, defensible first-pass PFMEAs to win
      quotes and start builds, but can’t dedicate senior engineers to every bid.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated first-pass D-FMEA and PFMEA generation from structured BoM and
      process data with configurable AIAG-VDA or MIL-STD formats.
    - >-
      Evidence-based S/O/D suggestions using component reliability libraries,
      process capability history, and prior accepted FMEAs.
    - >-
      Auto-generated initial control plan mapped to PFMEA detection/prevention
      actions and MSA needs.
    - >-
      Closed-loop action tracking that updates PFMEA/control plan and
      recalculates RPN/AP when mitigations change.
    - >-
      Integrations with PLM/MES/ERP to keep FMEA documents synchronized with
      engineering changes and routings.
    - >-
      Audit-ready exports (AIAG-VDA spreadsheet, APIS/IQ-RM import, PDF) with
      change logs and approvals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Draft an AIAG-VDA aligned FMEA/PFMEA (or FMECA) from your BoM and process in
    hours, not weeks—complete with S/O/D suggestions, initial control plan, and
    full traceability to design/process data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Account-specific, feedback-trained knowledge graph that compounds with use,
    mapping BoM/process patterns to proven failure modes and controls—plus deep
    connectors to PLM/MES that most competitors lack. This yields higher-quality
    first drafts, faster approvals, and audit-ready traceability that is
    difficult to replicate without large, domain-specific datasets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality, manufacturing, and reliability leaders at communications equipment
    manufacturers (NAICS 334290) who must launch robust products fast and pass
    audits without overloading their teams.
  problem: >-
    External: Building FMEAs/PFMEAs and control plans from scratch takes weeks,
    invites copy‑paste errors, and quickly goes stale. Internal: Teams are
    buried in spreadsheets, meetings, and audit pressure. Philosophical:
    Engineers should prevent failures, not spend their days formatting risk
    tables.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of NPI gates, customer audits, and field
    reliability in communications equipment. Our team blends manufacturing
    quality expertise with practical AI to auto‑draft industry‑standard
    FMEA/PFMEA with consistent severity/occurrence/detection suggestions and an
    initial control plan. Security‑first design and traceable outputs align with
    your QMS.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload your BoM and process routing (or connect PLM/MES). 2) Receive an
    auto‑drafted FMEA/PFMEA with S/O/D suggestions plus a starter control plan.
    3) Review with your team, calibrate ratings, assign actions, and export to
    your templates with versioning and audit trails.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot on one product line.
    Transitional: Download a sample FMEA/PFMEA + control plan and a time‑savings
    calculator.
  success: >-
    First‑pass FMEAs in hours, not weeks; aligned control plans; faster NPI
    gates and design reviews; smoother audits; fewer field issues and escapes;
    captured tribal knowledge; a repeatable, data‑driven risk process that
    boosts customer confidence.
  failure: >-
    Without this, expect late‑stage defects, audit findings, launch delays,
    firefighting, customer escapes, higher warranty costs, and erosion of trust
    in your quality system.
