leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on presses/loaders/case processors leads to 5–15% OEE
      loss and missed shipment SLAs during demand spikes.
    - >-
      Reactive maintenance and tribal-knowledge troubleshooting cause long mean
      time to repair (MTTR), especially across shifts or with high technician
      turnover.
    - >-
      Older loaders and packaging lines are under-instrumented; PLC/HMI alarms
      are threshold-based and miss early degradation (bearings, vacuum systems,
      powder feed variability).
    - >-
      Scrap/rework rises during incipient failures (primer feed jams, powder
      drop drift, bullet seating/crimp misalignment), raising cost per thousand
      rounds by 1–3%.
    - >-
      Spare parts lead times and constrained maintenance windows make planning
      difficult; parts are either overstocked (capital tied up) or absent when
      needed.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs, batch records, and CMMS; no closed-loop link
      from anomaly detection to work orders and root-cause learnings.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge+cloud AI service that ingests PLC data (OPC UA/Modbus),
      vibration/acoustic/current/temperature sensors, and production/scrap
      counters to detect anomalies and predict failures 3–14 days in advance.
    - >-
      Prebuilt model templates for common ammo machine types (collators, primer
      feed, powder drop, bullet seating/crimping, case processing,
      pick-and-place packaging) with known failure modes and signatures.
    - >-
      Closed-loop CMMS integration (SAP PM, Maximo, eMaint, Fiix, UpKeep):
      auto-create work orders with recommended checks, spare parts, and priority
      based on risk.
    - >-
      Operator-first UI with red-yellow-green health scores per station,
      explainable alerts (which sensor/channel deviated), and SOP checklists to
      reduce MTTR.
    - >-
      Spares and scheduling advisor: predicts parts consumption and recommends
      maintenance windows that minimize throughput impact.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: on-prem/edge for air-gapped plants, or hybrid
      with 99.5%+ service availability and role-based access; ITAR/CMMC-aware
      data handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime on loaders and packaging lines by 30–50% and
    increase OEE by 5–10 points within 90 days using ammo-specific predictive
    models and edge/on‑prem deployment that integrates with existing PLCs and
    CMMS. Payback typically <6 months per line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammo-specific failure-mode library and pre-trained models tied to specific
    loader/packaging assets, built from multi-site datasets and OEM
    collaborations. Edge-first deployment that works air-gapped, plus
    closed-loop CMMS workflows that shorten MTTR. Early mover with validated
    case studies and ROI guarantees in this niche.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and maintenance leaders at small‑arms ammunition plants who must keep
    presses, loaders, case processors, and packaging lines running on time with
    lean crews and high quality.
  problem: >-
    - External: Unplanned stoppages from feeder jams, die wear, lubrication
    issues, and sensor drift; no early warning.

    - Internal: Teams feel blind to machine health, stuck firefighting, and
    pressured by missed ship dates.

    - Philosophical: Critical equipment should warn before it fails—reliability
    shouldn’t rely on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know every minute of a down loader costs output, overtime, and
    risk.

    - Authority: Built by manufacturing data scientists and maintenance
    engineers; deployed in high‑speed discrete manufacturing; integrates with
    PLC/SCADA and common sensors (vibration, current, temperature, pressure);
    secure cloud or on‑prem options.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Tap PLC tags/sensors (OPC UA/Modbus/CSV), deploy an edge
    collector, baseline machines in days.

    - Learn: AI models perform anomaly detection and failure prediction on
    presses, loaders, case processors, and packaging lines.

    - Act: Real‑time alerts with contributing signals and recommended checks;
    auto‑create CMMS tickets; weekly reliability reports.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute line assessment with your machine list.

    - Transitional: Start a 30‑day pilot on one line using our checklist and ROI
    model; request a sample health dashboard.
  success: >-
    - Reduced unplanned downtime and scrap; higher OEE and schedule adherence.

    - Shift from calendar‑based to condition‑based maintenance; extended
    tool/component life.

    - Clear, auditable root causes; calmer shifts and safer operations.
  failure: >-
    - Continued firefighting, costly stoppages, and missed orders.

    - Hidden faults escalate to jams, die damage, safety incidents, and margin
    erosion.

  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned stops on loaders, case processors, and packaging lines hurt
      output and schedules.
    - Machine issues hide in noisy sensor data until they become failures.
    - 'Reactive fixes drive overtime, expedite parts, and scrap.'
    - Tooling and bearings wear out faster than planned.
    - Limited visibility across shifts leads to repeat downtime causes.
  solution:
    - Continuously analyze machine/sensor data to flag anomalies early.
    - Predict likely failures hours or days in advance with confidence scores.
    - 'Notify the right technician with root‑cause signals, not just alarms.'
    - Plan maintenance during changeovers—not mid‑shift.
    - Track asset health to extend tooling and component life.
  features:
    - >-
      Fast data ingestion from PLCs/SCADA and common protocols (OPC UA, Modbus,
      MQTT).
    - Edge agent with offline buffering for air‑gapped facilities.
    - 'Models tuned for cyclic machinery (press strokes, feed cycles, conveyors).'
    - Real‑time anomaly scores per station with trend and drift detection.
    - >-
      Failure mode indicators for misfeeds, jams, overheating, vibration, and
      motor/bearing wear.
    - Smart alerts via email/SMS/Teams with escalation and quiet hours.
    - CMMS integration to auto‑create work orders and attach diagnostics.
    - 'Downtime, MTBF, and OEE impact dashboards by line and shift.'
    - 'Role‑based access, audit logs, and encryption in transit/at rest.'
    - 'Time‑to‑value playbook: results in weeks, not months.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect: Deploy the edge agent and link PLCs/sensors in hours.'
    - 'Baseline: Learn normal operating patterns over 2–4 weeks.'
    - 'Predict: Start receiving failure forecasts and prioritized alerts.'
    - 'Act: Schedule planned maintenance and order parts just‑in‑time.'
