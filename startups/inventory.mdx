  problem:
    - >-
      Release timing and quantities are planned on spreadsheets with limited
      scenario analysis, causing stockouts of high-velocity SKUs and over-aging
      of slower SKUs that tie up cash.
    - >-
      Wineries struggle to balance DTC vs. wholesale allocations; DTC peaks
      (club releases, holidays) collide with distributor demands, resulting in
      margin erosion or missed sales.
    - >-
      Forecasting is reactive; limited use of historical signals (club churn,
      seasonality, tasting room traffic, weather, events) drives poor accuracy
      and over/underproduction decisions.
    - >-
      Cash flow planning is disconnected from inventory and channel plans;
      wineries lack a unified view of cash conversion and inventory turns by
      SKU/vintage.
    - >-
      Operational constraints (bottling schedules, glass/cork lead times,
      compliance, vintage constraints) are not modeled, causing plan slippage
      and emergency discounting.
    - >-
      No easy way to simulate price/discount elasticity by channel to maximize
      contribution margin while protecting brand equity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data unification: Connect POS/ecommerce (Commerce7, WineDirect, Shopify),
      club systems, distributor depletion data (VIP/Enolytics),
      inventory/production (vintrace, InnoVint, Ekos), and accounting
      (QuickBooks, NetSuite).
    - >-
      Demand forecasting: SKU/vintage/channel forecasts using seasonality, club
      cadence, tasting room traffic, promo calendar, weather/event data; target
      MAPE ≤15% for top 80% of volume.
    - >-
      Optimization engine: Mixed-integer optimization to recommend release
      dates, channel/state allocations, and quantities to maximize contribution
      margin subject to inventory, cash targets, production and compliance
      constraints.
    - >-
      Cash flow and margin modeling: Forward 12–18 month rolling cash model
      linking release plan, COGS, discounts, and AR by channel; highlight cash
      shortfall windows and plan mitigations.
    - >-
      Scenario planner: What-if simulations for price changes, club shipment
      mix, promo timing, and distributor allocations; compare scenarios on KPI
      deltas (GM%, CCC, stockouts risk).
    - >-
      Automations and workflows: Generate release calendar, push allocations to
      DTC/club systems, create distributor allocation sheets, notify teams of
      risk thresholds (e.g., weeks-of-supply below target).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven release scheduling and allocation that unifies inventory, demand,
    and cash flow to maximize gross margin and free cash, cutting stockouts by
    up to 30% and reducing aged inventory by 15–25%, with scenario planning
    purpose-built for winery constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization tuned to winery realities (vintage constraints,
    club rules, DTC seasonality) combined with deep integrations into
    Commerce7/WineDirect and production ERPs. Over time, a cross-winery
    anonymized dataset powers superior benchmarks and elasticities, creating a
    data network effect that is hard to replicate.
