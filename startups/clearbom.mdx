  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering and supply-chain teams in NAICS 334290 lack a unified way to
      assess lifecycle/obsolescence, availability, price volatility,
      country-of-origin, ECCN/EAR risk, Section 889 bans, UFLPA exposure, and
      conflict minerals on an entire BoM in near real time.
    - >-
      Manual screening across multiple systems takes 1–3 weeks per BoM, causing
      NPI delays and missed shipments.
    - >-
      High false positives from generic denied-party tools lead to alert
      fatigue; high false negatives create regulatory exposure.
    - >-
      Export-control classifications (ECCN) are inconsistent across programs and
      vendors; internal expertise is scarce and expensive.
    - >-
      Component EOL/PCN notices are fragmented; substitutions are identified
      late, triggering redesigns and line-down events.
    - >-
      Conflict minerals and ESG disclosures (CMRT/RCOI) require heavy supplier
      outreach and data wrangling, risking audit findings.
  solution:
    - >-
      Secure BoM ingestion via CSV, XLSX, and connectors to PLM/ERP (Arena,
      Agile/Oracle, Teamcenter, Propel, NetSuite, SAP).
    - >-
      Automated part normalization and deduplication with confidence scoring;
      GPN/MPN/ALT mapping across distributors and OEMs.
    - >-
      Lifecycle/obsolescence scoring using fused signals (PCNs/EOLs,
      manufacturer roadmaps, shipment trends).
    - >-
      Supply risk and availability index from multi-distributor inventory,
      lead-time trends, and allocation signals.
    - >-
      Price volatility index using rolling 30/90-day distributor quotes, spot
      data, and currency effects.
    - >-
      Trade and sanctions screening: ECCN probability classification with
      rule-based explainability; EAR/ITAR red flags; Section 889 vendor bans;
      OFAC/BIS lists; MEU/Military end-use heuristics.
    - >-
      Country-of-origin inference using customs/HTS data, manufacturer
      disclosures, and shipment patterns; flags for embargoed/jurisdictional
      risk.
    - >-
      Conflict minerals mapping: automated CMRT/RCOI roll-up, supplier outreach
      automation, gap closure tracking, and audit-ready reports.
    - >-
      BoM-level scorecards with drill-down and recommended alternates
      (form-fit-function), impact to cost, lead time, and compliance.
    - >-
      Change simulation: evaluate design substitutions and supplier moves for
      compliance and risk before committing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, explainable BoM-wide risk and compliance scoring that unifies
    obsolescence, availability, pricing, ECCN/EAR red flags, Section 889, UFLPA,
    country-of-origin, and conflict minerals into a single workflow—cutting
    screening time from weeks to hours and reducing redesign and enforcement
    risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A unified part knowledge graph purpose-built for communications equipment
    linking lifecycle, origin, ECCN, sanctions, Section 889, UFLPA, and CMRT
    data—continuously enriched by multi-source signals and customer feedback
    loops—delivered with explainable AI embedded directly in PLM/ERP workflows,
    creating switching costs and network effects as more BoMs refine the model.

  character: >-
    Ops, supply‑chain, and compliance leaders at Other Communications Equipment
    manufacturers (NAICS 334290) who want every BoM to be buildable, compliant,
    and cost‑stable.
  problem: >-
    External: EOL/NRND parts, long lead times, price spikes, country‑of‑origin
    constraints, ECCN/EAR red flags, and 3TG (conflict minerals) due‑diligence
    demands. Internal: Fragmented data and manual spreadsheets slow decisions
    and invite audit risk. Philosophical: Building critical communications gear
    shouldn’t be derailed by opaque, risky supply chains.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the launch pressure, line‑stop risk, and audit scrutiny in
    334290. Authority: Our AI scores BoMs for lifecycle risk, availability,
    price volatility, country‑of‑origin, ECCN/EAR red flags, and
    conflict‑minerals traces, with transparent evidence links and clear
    explanations.
  plan: >-
    1) Securely upload a BoM or connect ERP/PLM. 2) Receive a prioritized risk
    scorecard with flags, evidence, and fixes (alternates, LTB alerts,
    multi‑source options). 3) Export audit‑ready docs (risk register, COO map,
    ECCN/EAR red‑flag screen, CMRT support) and track mitigations via API.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on one BoM or book a 30‑minute demo. Transitional:
    Download a sample report and the 334290 BoM risk checklist.
  success: >-
    Confident releases, fewer redesigns, shorter lead times, lower spot‑buy
    spend, proactive export compliance, clean customer audits, resilient
    multi‑sourcing, and more predictable margins.
  failure: >-
    Line stops and missed ship dates, emergency redesigns from EOL parts, export
    holds or penalties, failed customer audits, and margin erosion from
    shortages and price shocks.
