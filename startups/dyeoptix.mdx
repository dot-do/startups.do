  problem:
    - >-
      Low first-pass yield (FPY): typical 60–75% for knit cotton/reactive
      dyeing; re-dye rate 15–35% by lots, causing schedule slippage and cost
      overruns.
    - >-
      Overuse of chemicals due to conservative recipes: salt/alkali/dye dosing
      often 10–25% above needed, raising chemical cost by $0.03–$0.08 per kg and
      effluent load (COD/BOD).
    - >-
      Lab-to-bulk mismatch: 1–3 extra lab dips and 1–2 bulk corrections per
      shade; ΔE00 variance driven by fiber lot, liquor ratio, machine
      differences, and water quality.
    - >-
      Operator variability: setpoint adherence and dosing profiles inconsistent;
      lack of closed-loop guidance increases re-runs.
    - >-
      Data silos: spectrophotometer QC data, lab recipes, machine PLC logs,
      ERP/MES orders not joined; no recipe-to-outcome learning.
    - >-
      Capacity loss: re-dyeing ties up jets; OEE hit 5–15%; missed OTIF targets
      and emergency air-freight penalties.
    - >-
      Sustainability pressure: brands target reductions in water/chem/energy;
      mills lack quantified, parameter-level pathways to comply.
    - >-
      Skills gap: senior dye masters retiring; onboarding new chemists takes
      6–12 months; tacit knowledge not codified.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and link historical data: recipes, QC ΔE results, lab dips, machine
      PLC logs (temperature/time profiles, liquor ratio, dosing curves),
      fiber/lot info, water quality, chemical batch data.
    - >-
      Build a mill-specific digital shade book: model recipe→outcome
      relationships per substrate, shade category, machine, and water profile
      using probabilistic ML with physics-informed constraints.
    - >-
      Generate first-pass starting recipes and process setpoints: salt/alkali
      curves, temperature ramps, hold times, pH windows, leveling agent amounts,
      liquor ratio guidance, with predicted pass probability and expected ΔE00.
    - >-
      Lab optimization: suggest minimal DOE (1–2 lab dips) to converge on
      bulk-ready recipe; automatic scale-up adjustments per machine and load
      size.
    - >-
      In-bath guidance: real-time alerts for deviations and prescriptive
      micro-doses/holds; auto-generate correction recipes if ΔE risk rises.
    - >-
      Post-run learning: capture outcome metrics to continuously retrain;
      per-operator coaching insights to standardize best practice.
    - >-
      Sustainability and cost dashboard: quantify savings in chemicals (kg/kg),
      water (L/kg), steam/kWh, and CO2e; produce audit-ready reports for brands.
    - >-
      Secure deployment: on-prem edge gateway or private cloud; role-based
      access; recipe IP protection with per-mill data segregation.
    - >-
      Standard 6-week paid pilot: pick 2–3 machines and 3 shade families; A/B
      200–300 lots; M&V plan agreed upfront; success criteria include FPY uplift
      ≥10pp, re-dye reduction ≥30%, and payback under 6 months.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase FPY to 85%+ within 90 days by recommending starting dye recipes and
    machine setpoints with pass-probability, cutting re-dyes 30–50% and
    chemicals 8–15%, with measurable ROI and brand-compliant color accuracy.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, structured recipe-to-outcome dataset and
    transfer-learning models tuned specifically for knit dyehouses, plus deep
    integrations with dyeing PLCs and spectrophotometer QC systems. This enables
    mill-specific accuracy from day one, rapid lab-to-bulk scaling, prescriptive
    in-bath corrections, and measurable FPY gains that generic LIMS, recipe
    libraries, machine-only optimizers, or standalone color-matching tools
    cannot deliver.

  character: >-
    Dyehouse and operations managers at knit fabric mills who need
    right-first-time shades, predictable costs, and on-time deliveries.
  problem: >-
    External: Low first-pass yield from lot variability, imperfect starting
    recipes, and operator-dependent trial-and-error; re-dyes drive chemical,
    water, steam, and energy waste; machines tied up while tweaking.

    Internal: Constant firefighting, pressure from buyers and QA, and low
    confidence in starting recipes.

    Philosophical: Getting color right the first time shouldn’t rely on
    guesswork—it should be data-driven and sustainable.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the stress of drifting shades, stalled machines, and costly
    re-dyes.

    Authority: Dye/process experts with an AI platform trained on your dye
    cards, lab-dips, spectro data, and machine logs; integrates with common
    dyehouse systems; proven in production environments with secure,
    mill-controlled data.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect: Import historical recipes, setpoints, delta E, lot attributes;
    integrate spectro/PLC/ERP.

    2) Calibrate: Model by fabric type, dye class, and machine; encode chemistry
    limits, cost, and sustainability constraints.

    3) Run: Get starting dye recipes and process setpoints per lot, plus
    confidence ranges; track FPY and continuously improve.

    Agreement plan:

    - Start on a pilot line/SKU with clear KPIs.

    - Human-in-the-loop approvals; no change to approved dyestuffs unless you
    choose.

    - Data privacy and opt-out at any time.
