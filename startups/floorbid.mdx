  problem:
    - >-
      Manual quoting from BOMs takes 1–3 hours per bid and is error-prone (waste
      factors, rounding, taxes).
    - >-
      Inconsistent pricing across estimators causes margin leakage (2–5% on
      average) and lost trust with customers.
    - >-
      Contractors lose jobs to faster competitors; proposals often go out 24–72
      hours after measure instead of same-day.
    - >-
      Proposals lack polish (no brand, no photos/options) and don’t support
      good/better/best; upsell opportunities are missed.
    - >-
      Follow-up is inconsistent; no visibility into proposal opens, stalls, or
      next steps, lowering close rates.
    - >-
      Data is re-entered in multiple systems (takeoff → spreadsheet → PDF →
      e-sign → accounting), creating mistakes and delays.
    - >-
      Supplier price changes aren’t reflected in pricebooks fast enough, causing
      underbids or last-minute change orders.
    - >-
      Collecting signatures, deposits, and change orders is fragmented; deposits
      slip and cash flow suffers.
    - >-
      Commercial bids require itemized alternates and compliance docs;
      assembling packets is tedious.
    - >-
      Owners lack analytics on win rate, cycle time, and gross margin by
      estimator/product line.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI imports BOMs (PDF, PlanSwift/MeasureSquare/Excel) and auto-applies your
      pricebook, waste factors, labor rates, taxes, and markups.
    - >-
      One-click good/better/best packages with curated product swaps and upsell
      suggestions to lift AOV 8–12%.
    - >-
      Branded, photo-rich, itemized proposals sent via SMS/email with real-time
      open/engagement tracking and smart reminders.
    - >-
      Built-in e-sign and payment links (deposits, progress payments); optional
      consumer financing and ACH to improve cash flow.
    - >-
      Price governance: lock margin floors, auto-update SKUs from supplier
      feeds, alerts on under-margin line items.
    - >-
      Change-order flows tied to the original proposal; single source of truth
      synced to QuickBooks/Xero and scheduling tools.
    - >-
      Commercial bid mode: alternates, exclusions, phasing, COI/W-9 attachments,
      and export to PDF packet.
    - >-
      Analytics: win rate, cycle time, margin by estimator/product line, option
      uptake, proposal SLA compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From takeoff to signed deposit in under 10 minutes—AI turns your BOM and
    pricing rules into branded, option-rich (good/better/best) proposals that
    customers can e-sign and pay on the spot, while protecting your margins
    automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Flooring-specific intelligence: prebuilt pricebooks, waste factors, and SKU
    mappings from major distributors, combined with AI trained on flooring
    scopes and alternates, enable accurate, option-rich proposals in minutes.
    Distributor and estimating-tool partnerships reduce setup friction and
    create preferred-vendor status. Over time, anonymized benchmarks (option
    uptake, margin ranges, close times) power recommendation loops competitors
    without flooring focus can’t match.
