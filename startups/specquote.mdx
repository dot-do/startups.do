  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual RFQ processing (email/PDF/portal) creates 24–72 hour quote
      turnaround, causing lost bids and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Spec matching is error-prone: sales/estimators manually map
      paints/coatings to catalog SKUs, miss approved alternates, or misread spec
      sections (e.g., VOC, finish, sheen, color system).
    - >-
      Compliance risk: region-specific VOC caps, LEED, fire-rating, and
      hazardous shipping rules are checked inconsistently; SDS/TDS attachments
      are often missing or outdated.
    - >-
      Margin leakage: cost updates, freight, hazmat fees, and price escalations
      aren’t consistently reflected; discounts/contract pricing override margin
      floors.
    - >-
      Inventory/lead-time blind spots: quotes include out-of-stock or obsolete
      SKUs; alternates are proposed without verified availability or
      manufacturer approval.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: ERP, PIM, price matrices, vendor emails, and spreadsheets
      aren’t unified; handoffs between inside sales, pricing, and purchasing add
      delay.
    - >-
      Bid quality inconsistency: alternates and exclusions vary by rep; win
      rates depend on individual experience rather than a repeatable process.
    - >-
      High labor cost: 10–20 minutes per RFQ line item is common; larger project
      bids can consume full days and still miss deadlines.
  solution:
    - >-
      RFQ ingestion: Parse emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, and portal exports;
      detect project metadata (owner, job site, due date), and line items/spec
      sections.
    - >-
      Spec-to-catalog mapping: Use a coatings ontology to map
      manufacturer/series/finish/sheen/coverage/VOC requirements to in-catalog
      SKUs; flag gaps.
    - >-
      Compliance engine: Check VOC/regulatory constraints by job location;
      auto-attach correct SDS/TDS; validate LEED or fire-rating where specified.
    - >-
      Inventory and vendor checks: Live ERP stock and vendor lead-time lookups;
      request vendor quotes when needed; surface available alternates with
      verified approval.
    - >-
      Margin-safe quote drafting: Apply price matrices, contracts,
      freight/hazmat/tinting fees, and margin floors; simulate scenarios to meet
      target margin and availability.
    - >-
      Approved alternates: Suggest cross-brand or series alternates based on
      equivalency rules and historical approvals; capture customer accept/reject
      for learning.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: Sales reviews AI-drafted quote, edits if needed,
      and one-click sends to customer or uploads to bid portal.
    - >-
      System sync: Push quote, attachments, and notes to ERP/CRM; tag reason
      codes (lost/won/alternate accepted) for closed-loop learning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFQ-to-quote time by 60–80%, improve gross margin 1–2 pts, and increase
    win rate 5–10% by auto-ingesting RFQs, mapping specs to your catalog,
    verifying compliance/stock, and drafting margin-safe quotes with approved
    alternates—ready for one-click send from your ERP/CRM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A coatings-specific spec and alternates knowledge graph validated with
    manufacturers, combined with fine-tuned RFQ parsing models and native ERP
    connectors—delivering high-precision spec matching and compliance checks
    that generic IDP/CPQ and email automation tools cannot replicate.
