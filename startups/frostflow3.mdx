  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers spend 10–20 hours/week building and reworking Excel-based
      schedules that rarely model pasteurizer/freezer/packaging constraints
      together.
    - >-
      Allergen and clean-in-place (CIP) sequencing is error-prone; poor runs
      lead to 2–6 hours of avoidable changeover/CIP per week per line and risk
      of cross-contact.
    - >-
      Freezer/hardening tunnel capacity is a hidden bottleneck; upstream
      pasteurization overproduces WIP that waits on freezers, creating overtime
      and missed due dates.
    - >-
      High SKU proliferation (flavors, inclusions, seasonal/promotional packs)
      causes frequent changeovers; manual balancing across lines is complex.
    - >-
      Labor and shift constraints (crews, skills, union rules) aren’t encoded in
      the schedule, driving premium overtime and last-minute reassignments.
    - >-
      Due-date pressure and retailer fines for late/short shipments (OTIF
      penalties) erode margin; rush orders destabilize weekly plans.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP/MES/maintenance systems, leading to stale
      capacity assumptions and reactive decision-making.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and QA holds force re-schedules that take hours,
      reducing schedule adherence and floor confidence.
  solution:
    - >-
      Create a digital twin of each plant: pasteurizers, aging tanks,
      freezers/hardening tunnels, packaging lines, changeover/CIP matrices,
      shift calendars, skills, and maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Optimize a 7–14 day horizon using finite-capacity and allergen-aware
      sequencing; gate upstream production by freezer capacity to prevent WIP
      pileups.
    - >-
      Auto-schedule CIP windows and changeovers with minimal loss of runtime;
      respect mandatory allergen-to-allergen cleaning requirements.
    - >-
      Provide an interactive Gantt and what-if simulator to assess schedule
      stability under rush orders, downtime, or ingredient shortages.
    - >-
      Integrate with ERP/MES (SAP, Infor M3, Microsoft D365, Oracle, Plex, QAD,
      Aptean) for orders, BOMs, routings, inventory, and confirmations; push
      approved sequences back to shop floor.
    - >-
      Alerting and replanning in under 5 minutes when constraints change (e.g.,
      freezer down, crew absence).
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 6–10 weeks from kickoff to go-live; week 3 first
      test schedule; week 6 on-floor trial; week 8 KPIs baselined; week 10 full
      handover.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific finite-capacity scheduling that produces a right-first-time
    1–2 week plan across pasteurizers, freezers, and packaging lines in minutes,
    sequencing allergens/CIP automatically. Improves OTIF to 98%+, reduces
    changeover/CIP hours 20–30%, lifts freezer throughput 5–10 percentage
    points, and cuts overtime 10–20%, with full ERP/MES integration and
    auditor-ready traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained APS optimized specifically for ice cream/frozen dessert
    flows (pasteurization→aging→freezer/hardening→packaging) with built-in
    allergen/CIP libraries and freezer gating models, enabling go-live in 6–10
    weeks versus 6–12 months for general APS. Prebuilt ERP/MES connectors and
    auditor-ready CIP/allergen traceability compress time-to-value and create
    high switching costs.

      Mid-to-large ice cream and frozen dessert plants (2–8 packaging lines;
      >10M liters or >10M lbs/year throughput). Roles: Plant Manager, Production
      Scheduler, Packaging Manager.
    - >-
      Co-packers/private-label manufacturers with high SKU mix and frequent
      promotions. Roles: VP Operations, Customer Service/Supply Planner.

  problem:
    - Schedules break when freezer or packaging capacity shifts.
    - Allergen and CIP rules force last-minute reshuffles.
    - Changeovers eat hours and push orders late.
    - 'Spreadsheets can’t model tanks, aging, or WIP expiry.'
