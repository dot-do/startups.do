leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Collections teams spend 20–40% of time manually triaging delinquent queues
      across core systems, dialers, and spreadsheets, delaying outreach during
      the highest-likelihood-to-cure window.
    - >-
      Outreach is often generic and not tailored to product type, risk, hardship
      signals, or member history, resulting in low right-party contact (RPC) and
      low promise-to-pay (PTP) kept rates.
    - >-
      Compliance exposure (FDCPA, Reg F, TCPA, UDAAP, state rules) causes
      under-contacting (fear-driven) or over-contacting (risk-driven), either
      increasing charge-offs or regulatory risk.
    - >-
      Limited analytics/experiment capability means teams can’t A/B test
      scripts, timing, and channels; learning cycles are months long.
    - >-
      Legacy collections suites are expensive, complex to implement (6–12
      months), and often require rip-and-replace versus augmenting existing
      dialers/messaging tools.
    - >-
      Inconsistent documentation and audit trails for consent, opt-outs, and
      call attempts increases exam risk and slows responses to examiner
      inquiries.
    - >-
      Managers lack clear, explainable ‘why this account, why now, what next’
      guidance to coach agents and prioritize daily work.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data connectors ingest member, loan/credit card, payment, and interaction
      data from core systems and dialers daily/near-real-time.
    - >-
      Risk and intent segmentation models score accounts for cure propensity,
      hardship likelihood, and optimal channel/time-of-day windows.
    - >-
      Next-Best-Action engine recommends specific actions (call, SMS, email,
      letter, hardship offer, deferment review, payment plan) with priorities
      and reasons.
    - >-
      Compliance Guardrails enforce Reg F frequency caps, call windows/time
      zones, FDCPA prohibitions, TCPA consent/opt-out, state rules, and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Outreach Composer generates channel-specific scripts/messages with
      member/product context and embedded payment links, with automatic language
      selection and grade-level tuning.
    - >-
      Agent Cockpit prioritizes daily queues with explainable reasons, dynamic
      scripts, and one-click actions via integrated dialer/SMS/email.
    - >-
      Strategy Studio for managers to A/B test scripts, cadences, and offers;
      monitor lift, RPC/PTP kept, and roll-rate impact; publish winning
      strategies.
    - >-
      Consent, Opt-out, and Preference Manager with digital capture, revocation
      logging, and APIs to sync with core and vendors.
    - >-
      Reporting & Audit: real-time dashboards for cure rate, dollars collected,
      roll rates, complaints/CFPB disputes, and exportable audit packages for
      examiners.
    - >-
      Security & Governance: SOC 2 Type II, role-based access, PHI/PII
      minimization, data retention controls, model governance (bias tests, drift
      alerts).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compliance-first, credit-union–tuned AI that prioritizes delinquent
    accounts, recommends the next best action, and composes compliant,
    empathetic outreach across channels—lifting cures 10–20% while reducing roll
    rates and examiner risk, without replacing your core, dialer, or messaging
    vendors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Credit union collections managers and member-recovery teams who need a
    member-first, compliant way to cure delinquencies faster.
  problem: >-
    They face growing delinquency queues, limited staff, and manual
    guesswork—creating inconsistent outreach, missed right‑party contact,
    compliance risk (Reg F/FDCPA/TCPA), and rising charge‑offs that strain
    member relationships.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect members and stay exam‑ready.

    for credit unions, combining prioritized account ranking, compliant
    omni‑channel script/message generation, and airtight auditability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely integrate core/LOS/CMS data; 2) Configure: Set
    policies, consent rules, tone, and guardrails; 3) Act: Work ranked queues
    with recommended actions and ready‑to‑send scripts
    (SMS/email/voice/letters); 4) Improve: Track outcomes, A/B test, and
    auto‑optimize with human‑in‑the‑loop controls.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download the compliance
    checklist and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Agents work the right accounts at the right time with approved messaging;
    higher cure rates, fewer roll‑forwards and charge‑offs, faster days‑to‑cure,
    consistent documentation, and stronger member satisfaction and trust.
  failure: >-
    Without clear next‑best‑actions and compliant outreach, teams risk rising
    losses, exam findings, member complaints, staff burnout, and reputational
    damage.
