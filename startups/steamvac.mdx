  problem:
    - >-
      Energy waste from conservative setpoints: 10–30% excess steam use and
      unnecessary vacuum/cooling time due to manual tuning and safety buffers.
    - >-
      Inconsistent quality: density/compression variability drives scrap,
      rework, and warranty risk; operators compensate by over-steaming.
    - >-
      Slow changeovers and long aging: trial-and-error recipe tuning extends
      setup by hours/days and inflates WIP and silo occupancy.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: few plants track steam/kg, vacuum kWh/cycle, or
      cooling-water ΔT per recipe; KPIs are not tied to setpoints.
    - >-
      Operator dependency: expertise locked in individuals; shifts produce
      different outcomes on the same mold/recipe.
    - >-
      Equipment stress: overuse of steam/vacuum increases condensate loads,
      leaks, pump wear, and unplanned downtime.
    - >-
      Throughput constraints: cycle times 60–180 s leave 5–15% potential
      productivity untapped on many molds.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-connected AI optimizer that ingests PLC data (OPC UA/Siemens
      S7/Rockwell/Beckhoff), historian tags, and lab QA results.
    - >-
      Physics- and recipe-aware models predicting density, compression strength,
      and part ejection temperature from setpoints, bead grade, bead
      moisture/pentane, ambient conditions, and mold geometry proxies.
    - >-
      Constraint-based setpoint recommender for steam pressure/time, vacuum
      level/time, cooling water time/ΔT, and aging time windows to meet spec at
      lowest cost.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optional control: send tuned recipes back to PLC with hard
      safety envelopes (OEM mechanical/thermal limits).
    - >-
      What-if simulator for new molds/bead grades and seasonal shifts; digital
      twin calibrated per mold.
    - >-
      A/B testing and controlled ramp plans to quantify savings with statistical
      confidence.
    - >-
      Root-cause and anomaly detection: steam trap/valve leak signatures, vacuum
      pump performance drift, condenser inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Recipe governance: central library, versioning, audit trail, and operator
      guidance via HMI/App (multilingual).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    EPS-specific, physics-informed AI that tunes steam, vacuum, cooling, and
    aging setpoints to hit density/compression targets at minimum energy and
