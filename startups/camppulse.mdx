  problem:
    - >-
      Owners/managers juggle SMS, email, Facebook messages, and multiple review
      sites in separate tools, leading to missed or slow responses (>12 hours
      median) and lost bookings.
    - >-
      Staff turnover and seasonal hiring cause inconsistent tone and policy
      adherence; no standardized responses or audit trail.
    - >-
      Guest context (site number, reservation status, balance due, past issues)
      is not available in messaging tools, causing back-and-forth and lower
      CSAT.
    - >-
      Review responses are ad hoc; post-stay review requests are inconsistently
      sent, resulting in low review velocity and ratings that don’t reflect
      actual guest satisfaction.
    - >-
      After-hours inquiries (late check-in, gate codes, hookups) are common;
      without automation, parks miss opportunities and create on-call workload.
    - >-
      No unified analytics to link response speed and review volume/ratings to
      occupancy, ADR, and channel mix.
  solution:
    - >-
      Centralized inbox aggregating SMS, email, web chat, Facebook/Instagram
      DMs, and major review sites (Google, Facebook, Yelp, TripAdvisor,
      Campendium, RV LIFE, The Dyrt).
    - >-
      RV-specific AI intent classification (reservation change, late arrival,
      gate code, site upgrade, hookup questions, amenities, maintenance, refund,
      quiet hours, Wi-Fi, propane) with confidence thresholds and
      human-in-the-loop approvals.
    - >-
      Contextual AI drafting using PMS data (Campspot, Newbook, RMS, ResNexus,
      CampLife, Campground Master): auto-personalize with guest name, dates,
      site number, balance, pet policy, late check-in instructions.
    - >-
      Rules-based routing and SLAs: on-call schedules, escalation to
      maintenance, housekeeping, or manager; after-hours auto-replies with
      dynamic information and escalation for high-priority issues.
    - >-
      Automated post-stay review requests via SMS/email with smart timing and
      segmentation (exclude problem stays; route NPS detractors to private
      feedback).
    - >-
      Templates and knowledge base: campground-specific policies, maps, FAQs;
      one-click snippets with Spanish/English localization.
    - >-
      Analytics tying response time, automation rate, and review
      velocity/ratings to bookings, occupancy, and channel mix; per-staff
      performance dashboards.
    - >-
      Mobile app + SMS fallback for staff on the move; push notifications; voice
      transcription of voicemails to the inbox.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One inbox for every guest message and review, powered by RV-specific AI that
    understands reservations and sites, drafts accurate replies, routes issues
    to staff, and drives more 5-star reviews—cutting response time by 70% and
    increasing review volume 30–50% within 60 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization: PMS-aware AI that understands sites, hookups, and
    campground policies out of the box; prebuilt integrations across leading
    campground systems; and a growing proprietary dataset of RV-specific intents
    and responses that generalist platforms lack. Early association partnerships
    and templates/playbooks shorten time-to-value to under 48 hours.
