leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Markdowns are set via static calendars and spreadsheets, causing avoidable
      margin erosion and missed clearance targets.
    - >-
      SKU-color-size demand is sparse and volatile; teams lack reliable
      elasticity estimates and guardrails to act confidently.
    - >-
      Pricing decisions are siloed by channel (stores vs ecom) and region,
      leading to inconsistent prices and brand dilution.
    - >-
      Merchants can’t systematically balance competing objectives (gross margin
      %, revenue, sell-through, inventory age) in one optimizer.
    - >-
      Competitor moves, promo lift, weather/events, and supply constraints are
      underused or ignored in pricing decisions.
    - >-
      Manual workflows consume 10–20 hours/week per planner; decisions happen
      too late in the season to matter.
    - >-
      Compliance constraints (MAP/brand floors) and explainability needs block
      adoption of algorithmic prices.
    - >-
      Executives lack a trusted, testable path (A/B or geotests) to quantify ROI
      and scale from pilot to enterprise.
  solution:
    - >-
      Prebuilt data connectors to POS/ERP/ecommerce (SAP, Oracle Retail, Aptos,
      Shopify, SFCC, Magento) plus flat-file/S3 ingestion.
    - >-
      Variant-aware demand and elasticity models (SKU-color-size or cluster)
      using causal signals (promo, stock, seasonality, weather, competitor,
      events).
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer that balances margin dollars, sell-through,
      revenue, and inventory age under constraints (MAP, floor/ceiling, step
      sizes, brand rules).
    - >-
      Markdown timing and depth optimizer with store/region/channel segmentation
      and ladder plans that adapt weekly.
    - >-
      Always-on dynamic pricing engine for ecommerce with throttled price
      changes and SEO-safe rules.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: quantify outcomes of alternative ladders, price
      floors, and promo calendars before committing.
    - >-
      Experimentation: geo-based and ecommerce A/B test orchestration with
      automated significance checks and holdouts.
    - >-
      Explainability and governance: price rationale, SHAP-style drivers,
      approval workflows, and audit trails; override tracking feeds back to
      models.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware clearance module that prioritizes aged, overstocked, and
      end-of-life items while protecting core lines.
    - >-
      Competitor and marketplace price intelligence ingestion with confidence
      scoring; reaction rules configurable by category.
    - >-
      Executive dashboards: GM% lift, margin dollars, sell-through, aged
      inventory reduction, stockouts, and clearance velocity by cohort.
    - >-
      APIs/exports to push decisions to POS, ecom, and promo engines; webhooks
      and Slack/Teams alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit margin and sell-through targets simultaneously. HemlineAI delivers 2–5%
    gross margin lift and 10–25% faster sell-through within 12 weeks via
    fashion-aware elasticity modeling, multi-objective optimization, and
    built-in guardrails and explainability—integrated to your POS/ecom with a
    pilot that proves ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Fashion-specific, privacy-preserving priors and lifecycle modeling that
    deliver reliable elasticity at SKU-variant granularity; a rapid, governed
    pilot framework that proves ROI in 8–12 weeks; and a deep connector catalog
    to POS/ecom that compresses time-to-value. The combination of
    explainability, MAP/brand guardrails, and multi-objective optimization
    drives organization-wide trust and adoption.
