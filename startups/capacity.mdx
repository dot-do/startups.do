leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Production planners rely on spreadsheets and email to split POs across
      factories/lines, causing 10–20% plan inaccuracies and frequent
      late/partial deliveries (OTIF below 85%).
    - >-
      Capacity is misestimated because constraints (SMV, line skills,
      changeovers, MOQs, colorways) aren’t modeled; results include overtime
      spikes or idle time (±25% weekly utilization variance).
    - >-
      Brands and factories lose real-time WIP visibility; 60–80% of status comes
      via unstructured emails/attachments (PDF/Excel/photos), leading to
      outdated calendars and reactive firefighting.
    - >-
      Confirmations and forecast changes are not reconciled quickly; it takes
      4–16 hours/week per planner to update PO splits and calendars, delaying
      decisions by days.
    - >-
      Exceptions (material delays, QC holds, rework, machine downtime) aren’t
      surfaced early; expediting costs and air freight increase by 2–5% of COGS.
    - >-
      Existing APS/MRP/PLM tools are heavy to implement, require clean master
      data, and don’t solve the “inbox as MES” reality for small/mid-size
      suppliers.
    - >-
      Multi-supplier brands lack a unified production calendar; data is
      inconsistently formatted across geographies (Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico,
      India).
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest demand and confirmations: connect to email (Gmail/O365), EDI, and
      CSV/ERP exports; auto-extract POs, quantities, sizes/colors,
      ex-factory/ship dates, and confirmations.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimization: integer programming models line skills,
      SMV, tack time, changeovers, MOQs, materials readiness, and holidays to
      produce optimal PO splits and a weekly/daily production calendar.
    - >-
      Continuous WIP from inbox parsing: parse supplier
      emails/attachments/photos to update cut/sew/finish percentages, delay
      reasons, and revised dates; auto-match to POs and lines.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate demand changes, material delays, or added
      shifts; compare OTIF, utilization, and overtime cost impacts side-by-side.
    - >-
      Exception management: flag at-risk POs (e.g., >3 days slip, <80% material
      readiness, QC fail); recommend actions (re-sequence, split, overtime) with
      quantified trade-offs.
    - >-
      Collaboration layer: supplier portal/email loops to confirm re-plans;
      track acceptance; maintain audit trail; bilingual UI (EN/ES/VI/BN).
    - >-
      Analytics and benchmarks: dashboards for OTIF, utilization variance,
      planner time saved, WIP aging, and supplier reliability scores; export to
      BI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From inbox to optimized production plan: auto-split POs, generate a
    constraint-aware factory calendar, and keep WIP current by parsing supplier
    emails—improving OTIF by 5–15 points and cutting planning time 50–70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of apparel-specific emails/docs and validated
    constraint libraries enables high auto-parse accuracy and realistic
    schedules; a pilot-first wedge with inbox parsing creates a data flywheel
    across suppliers, producing benchmarks and reliability scores competitors
    lack. Fast time-to-value without heavy master data cleanup differentiates
    against traditional APS/ERP modules.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-market apparel accessories and apparel factories (100–1,500 employees;
      5–40 lines) in Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Mexico, and the US using
      email/Excel for planning.
