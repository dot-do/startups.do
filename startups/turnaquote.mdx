leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual, and inconsistent quoting: complex quotes often take 1–3
      hours to assemble (BOM lookup, method steps, capacity checks), creating
      0.5–1.5 FTE of quoting overhead for mid-size labs (20–40 quotes/week) and
      causing delays in customer response.
    - >-
      Unreliable TAT promises: 15–30% of orders miss quoted TATs due to capacity
      blind spots (instrument downtime, staff scheduling, sample surges),
      leading to rework, fee waivers, and lower NPS.
    - >-
      Margin erosion from mispricing: quotes rarely reflect real-time consumable
      costs, re-test probabilities, and overtime/rush impacts; many labs see
      ±5–10 percentage-point variance between quoted vs. realized gross margin.
    - >-
      Capacity not priced-in: identical prices offered regardless of current
      load undercut margins and extend backlogs; no systematic approach to
      dynamic rush surcharges or capacity-aware scheduling.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge risk: method-specific BOMs and realistic step durations
      live in spreadsheets and the heads of senior staff, making quotes fragile,
      error-prone, and hard to scale.
    - >-
      Lost deals from slow or non-itemized quotes: enterprise buyers
      increasingly require itemized quotes and realistic TAT windows; slow or
      opaque quotes lose to faster competitors even at higher prices.
    - >-
      Poor forecastability: managers lack forward visibility into instrument and
      staff utilization based on pending quotes, preventing proactive staffing,
      overtime, or subcontracting decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest method BOMs and standardized workflows; map to resource
      requirements (instruments, staff roles, consumables).
    - >-
      Integrate with LIMS/ELN/ERP and calendars to capture current WIP,
      maintenance windows, and staff availability.
    - >-
      ML models predict step-level and end-to-end TAT distributions by method
      and sample type using historical throughput, seasonality, re-test rates,
      and downtime patterns.
    - >-
      Dynamic, capacity-aware pricing that applies rush surcharges, overtime
      costs, and subcontracting options when load is high.
    - >-
      Automated, itemized quote generation (PDF/HTML) with line items, TAT
      window, assumptions, and terms; approval workflows and margin guardrails.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate what-if schedules (rush vs. standard, split
      batches, alternate instruments, subcontract) to pick best cost/TAT
      trade-off.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: compare quoted vs. actuals (cost, TAT) to continuously
      recalibrate BOMs, durations, buffers, and pricing rules.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors for LIMS (LabWare, LabVantage, SampleManager,
      STARLIMS), ERPs (NetSuite, SAP), and CPQ (Salesforce) for seamless
      workflow.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, itemized quotes with capacity-aware, ML-predicted TATs using your
    method BOMs, staff/instrument calendars, and historical throughput—cut quote
    turnaround by 80%, reduce TAT misses by 30–50%, and add 2–5 margin points
    while improving win rate and customer trust.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-lab, opt-in anonymized performance data enables transfer learning by
    method and instrument, producing more accurate TAT predictions than any
    single-lab dataset; combined with deep LIMS integrations and a curated
    method/BOM library, this creates a defensible accuracy and time-to-value
    moat that generic CPQ or LIMS add-ons cannot match.
