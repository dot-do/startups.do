  title: Inventory Optimization and Reorder Point Calculator
  description: >-
    Computes safety stocks, reorder points, and min/max levels per item to hit
    target service levels with minimal cash tied up.
  targetUsers:
    - Procurement
    - Warehouse Manager
    - Supply Chain Lead
  triggers:
    - Monthly cycle or after lead-time change
    - New item on-boarded
  inputs:
    - Consumption history per item
    - Supplier lead-time variability

    modelCapability: 4.5
    overall: 4.7
  risks:
    - Poor lead-time data
    - Seasonality shifts
    - Items with highly lumpy demand need overrides
  dependencies:
    - Item master and usage history
    - Lead time data by supplier
    - Access to update or export to ERP
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic stockouts of critical inputs (yarn counts, canvas greige, dyes,
      trims) cause loom stoppages and late shipments, costing 1–3% of monthly
      revenue in penalties and lost orders.
    - >-
      Excess working capital tied up in slow-moving SKUs (colors/sizes) due to
      MOQs and batch-dye constraints; typical mills hold 20–35% more inventory
      than needed.
    - >-
      Highly variable supplier and import lead times (port delays, seasonal
      congestion) make current min/max rules inaccurate and reactive.
    - >-
      ERP MRP modules lack probabilistic safety stock logic; planners rely on
      spreadsheets without service-level targets or variance-based lead time
      modeling.
    - >-
      SKU proliferation (colors, prints, sizes) and intermittent demand create
      either over-buys or frequent expedites with premium freight.
    - >-
      Poor data hygiene (inconsistent item masters, lead time fields not
      maintained) and no continuous monitoring of demand/lead time variance.
    - >-
      Lack of clear KPIs for service levels, stockout frequency, and cash tied
      up; leadership cannot measure inventory performance objectively.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven safety stocks and reorder points per item/vendor/site computed
      from actual demand and lead time variability to meet target service levels
      at minimum cash.
    - >-
      Item segmentation (ABC-XYZ) and service-level policies by class (e.g., A/X
      at 99%, B/Y at 97%, C/Z at 94%) to balance risk and capital.
    - >-
      Lead-time modeling learns from receipts and supplier calendars; supports
      variable and intermittent demand (Croston/TSB) and seasonality.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware recommendations: respects MOQs, dye/finishing batch
      sizes, container multiples, vendor holidays, planned shutdowns.
    - >-
      Min/max and order-up-to policies auto-calculated; push-to-ERP POs or
      planner approval workflows; WhatsApp/SMS/Email alerts when ROP is
      breached.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: quantify cash vs. service trade-offs before committing
      (e.g., +1% service level costs +$80k working capital).
    - >-
      Vendor scorecards: lead-time bias/variance, fill rate, expedite frequency,
      and cost-to-serve to drive negotiations and sourcing decisions.
    - >-
      Data quality guardrails: flag anomalous lead times, outliers, dormant
      SKUs, and unit-of-measure issues before they pollute calculations.
    - >-
      Dashboards: service level, stockouts/1,000 item-days, inventory turns,
      slow/non-moving stock, expedite spend, planner workload savings.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: ERP connector (SAP B1, Odoo, Tally, QuickBooks
      Commerce) + CSV option; go-live in 2–4 weeks with pilot in one plant.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit 97–99% service levels with 15–30% less inventory by turning your ERP
    data into optimal safety stocks, reorder points, and min/max
    levels—purpose-built for textile bag and canvas operations in 2–4 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Textile-specific optimization templates and priors (yarn counts, greige
    GSM/width, dye batch behaviors), prebuilt ERP connectors (Odoo, Tally, SAP
    B1) enabling 2–4 week deployments, and a growing proprietary dataset of
    supplier lead-time variability in South and Southeast Asia—guided by an

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, planning, and procurement leaders at textile bag and canvas
    mills who want uninterrupted production and on-time shipments without excess
    working capital tied up in inventory.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile demand by style/size, long and variable supplier lead
    times, MOQs, and seasonality cause stockouts on yarn/canvas and overstock on
    slow-movers.

    - Internal: Planners are forced to guess with spreadsheets, firefighting
    instead of planning, with no clear reorder points or safety stocks.

    - Philosophical: Inventory should enable uptime and customer promises—not
    strangle cash and margins.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill variability and buyer pressures. Our team blends proven
    stochastic inventory math with machine learning on your demand and lead-time
    data. We integrate with your ERP (SAP B1, Dynamics, Odoo, custom), respect
    MOQs/pack sizes/batch realities, and have delivered 20–30% inventory
    reductions while improving service to 97–99%.
  plan: >-
    - Connect data: Items, demand and lead-time history, BOMs, open POs via
    secure files or API (days, not months).

    - Calibrate: Set target service levels by segment, holding/ordering costs,
    MOQs/pack sizes, review cycles.

    - Go live: Automated safety stocks, reorder points, and min/max per item;
    daily refresh; buyer workbench and alerts.

    - Low-risk: 2-week pilot on a subset, clear ROI targets, no long-term
    contract, data privacy by design.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute assessment or start a 30‑day pilot.
    - Transitional: Download a sample policy report and run the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    - Uptime: Fewer loom, cutting, and sewing stoppages.

    - Service: 95–99% OTIF with fewer expedites and rush fees.

    - Cash: 15–35% less working capital in raw, WIP, and trims.

    - Clarity: Transparent per‑item policies, clear min/max and reorder points,
    focused buyer actions.

    - Confidence: Predictable deliveries, audit‑ready logic, happier planners
    and customers.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing stockouts on yarn, canvas, and trims; bloated bins and dead stock;
    cash locked in slow movers; emergency airfreight and overtime; missed
    shipments, write‑offs, and eroding margins; planner burnout.

    - No clear view of the service level vs. cash trade-off.
  solution:
    - 'Item-level, probabilistic buffers tuned to your target service levels.'
    - 'Automatic safety stock, reorder points, and min/max updated daily.'
