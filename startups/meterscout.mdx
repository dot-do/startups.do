leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic supply risk: electronic sensors, MCUs, and passives with 26–52
      week lead-times stall builds; wetted elastomers and alloys face
      allocations and PFAS/lead-restriction shifts.
    - >-
      Compliance complexity: OEMs must meet NSF/ANSI 61/372, AWWA standards,
      ATEX/IECEx, UL/CSA, RoHS/REACH, Buy America/BAA, and emerging PFAS rules;
      validating alternates is slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Obsolescence and PCNs: frequent supplier EOL/PCNs create urgent
      engineering change orders (ECOs), extending NPI and sustaining cycles by
      4–12 weeks.
    - >-
      Siloed data: BOM, drawings, specs, supplier data, and compliance documents
      reside in ERP/PLM/email; no unified view to quickly propose compliant
      alternates.
    - >-
      Manual RFQ/RFI: sourcing teams spend days assembling data packs and
      contacting suppliers; low response rates and inconsistent documentation.
    - >-
      Inconsistent substitutions: plants and teams create local alternates
      without corporate approval or traceability, risking audit failures and
      warranty exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      BOM intelligence engine ingests ERP/PLM data (CSV/API), classifies parts
      (wetted/material, sensor/electronics, mechanical), and normalizes specs.
    - >-
      Parametric matching and constraint solver propose alternates using
      performance envelope (fluid, temperature, pressure, accuracy),
      footprint/pin compatibility, and mechanical fit.
    - >-
      Compliance-aware filtering maps parts to standards (NSF/ANSI 61/372, AWWA
      C700+, ATEX/IECEx, UL/CSA, RoHS/REACH, MID, NEMA/IP, BAA/Buy America),
      flags gaps, and assembles documentation.
    - >-
      Lead-time and risk aggregation pulls live distributor/manufacturer data,
      PCNs/EOLs, country-of-origin, capacity signals, and logistics risk to
      prioritize viable options.
    - >-
      Automated RFI/RFQ workflow packages technical requirements and compliance
      asks; tracks supplier responses and generates a ranked, costed shortlist.
    - >-
      Change-package output generates ECO/ECR-ready packets (datasheets, CoCs,
      DoCs, test reports, PPAP-like evidence, risk assessment) and syncs
      decisions back to PLM/ERP.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Approve compliant, in-stock alternates for wetted materials, sensors,
    electronics, and mechanical parts in 48–72 hours, cutting sourcing cycle
    time by 60%, reducing line-down risk by 50%, and preserving full audit
    traceability for NSF/ANSI, ATEX/IECEx, UL/CSA, and RoHS/REACH.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized, audit-ready knowledge graph that unifies wetted-material
    compatibility, sensor/electronic cross-compatibility, and real-world
    compliance documentation for 334514, continuously reinforced by OEM feedback
    and supplier RFx outcomes. This dataset and model feedback loop produces
    higher-confidence alternates and faster approvals than horizontal sourcing
    tools, and is tightly integrated with PLM/ERP change workflows.

    Ops, sourcing, and engineering leaders at totalizing fluid meter and
    counting device OEMs who must keep builds on time and compliant while
    controlling cost and supply risk.
  problem: >-
    Critical wetted materials, sensors, electronics, and mechanical parts go EOL
    or slip to long lead times; certifications vary by market; teams face
    last-minute redesigns and audit risk. It shouldn’t be this hard to secure
    compliant substitutes and keep production moving.
  guide: >-
    Supplier Scouting and Part Substitution Agent: an AI service trained for
    NAICS 334514 that maps drop-in or near-fit alternates with compliance
    awareness (NSF/ANSI 61/372, UL, CE, RoHS, REACH, ATEX/IECEx, FDA/WRAS/ACS)
    and real-time lead-time/supply risk data. Domain experts validate results
    and supplier fit.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload BOM/specs and constraints (media, pressure/temp, certifications,
    lead-time/cost targets) under NDA. 2) Receive vetted alternates ranked by
    compliance fit, lead-time, cost, and risk with datasheets and gap notes. 3)
    Select options; we intro suppliers, coordinate quotes/samples, and provide
    adoption docs (ECO/PPAP/CoC).
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot by submitting one at-risk part or subassembly; get a ranked
    shortlist within days. Or request the capability brief and substitution
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Approved, compliant alternates for wetted materials, sensors, electronics,
    and mechanical parts; shorter lead times; fewer expedites; diversified
    supplier base; audit-ready documentation; on-time shipments and smoother
    NPI/ECO cycles.
  failure: >-
    Line-down events, costly redesigns, missed shipments, and certification
    setbacks leading to penalties, expediting costs, and lost revenue.
