leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High volume and cost of Tier-1 rider support (fare adjustments, receipts,
      promo issues, duplicate charges) create long queues and inconsistent
      outcomes.
    - >-
      Refund leakage due to inconsistent policy application, manual errors, and
      fraudulent claims increases CX cost and erodes margins.
    - >-
      Existing chatbots deflect inquiries but cannot safely authorize monetary
      adjustments or access trip/receipt data end-to-end with auditability.
    - >-
      24/7 multilingual coverage is expensive to staff; unpredictable spikes
      (weather, events, outages) overwhelm human teams.
    - >-
      Compliance risk around payments and PII (PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR/CCPA) limits
      automation and increases integration friction.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stacks (dispatch, PSPs, CCaaS, analytics) slow resolution
      and complicate root-cause analysis.
  solution:
    - >-
      LLM-driven Tier-1 support agent embedded in in-app chat, web, email, and
      WhatsApp that identifies the ride, classifies the issue, and executes
      refunds/credits/promo fixes end-to-end.
    - >-
      Policy engine with hard guardrails: refund caps, velocity limits, step-up
      verification, risk scores; auto-escalation for high-risk or out-of-policy
      cases.
    - >-
      Safe-guarded payment adjustments via tokenized refunds/credits through the
      operator’s PSP; full audit trail and double-approval for high-value cases.
    - >-
      Receipts and invoice automation: on-demand retrieval, corrections (e.g.,
      tip added/removed, business profile), and resend via preferred channel.
    - >-
      Promo resolution: eligibility checks, re-issue/extension, and abuse
      prevention using device/account heuristics.
    - >-
      Duplicate charge detection across payment attempts, preventing double
      refunds and reconciling partial authorizations/holds.
    - >-
      RAG-powered policy and knowledge retrieval so the agent cites policy
      snippets in responses; A/B policy enforcement and change management.
    - >-
      Analytics and operations console: automation rate, FCR, CSAT, refund
      leakage, fraud flags, SLA adherence; cohort and root-cause analysis.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Resolve 60–80% of Tier-1 rider issues in under 2 minutes with policy-locked,
    auditable refunds and receipt delivery—cutting support cost per ticket by
    50–70% while reducing refund leakage by 15–30% and improving CSAT to 4.5+/5.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mobility-specific policy engine and guardrails with prebuilt integrations to
    trip data and PSPs, enabling auditable monetary actions few generic bots can
    perform. Accumulated domain dataset and test harness for duplicate charges,
    promo abuse, and fare adjustments delivers higher FCR and lower leakage than
    generalist solutions. OEM distribution via dispatch platforms creates
    embedded, sticky adoption.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Ride-hailing platforms (regional to global) with 10k–1M+ trips/day;
      decision makers: VP/Head of Operations, CX, Trust & Safety.
    - >-
      Taxi dispatch platforms and white-label mobility platforms serving fleets
      (100–10,000 vehicles).

      Tier-1 support patterns.
    - >-
      BPOs/contact centers serving mobility clients seeking automation to
      improve margins.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to Ops/CX leaders at ride-hailing/taxi platforms; ROI-focused
      pilots with 4–8 week timelines.
    - >-
      CCaaS marketplaces (Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom, Freshdesk) with
      certified app listings and co-marketing.
    - >-
      Partnerships with taxi dispatch/white-label platforms to embed
      white-labeled automation for their fleets.

      and case-study-driven content (automation rate, refund savings).
    - BPO partnerships to offer automation-first managed service bundles.
    - >-
      Bottom-up developer adoption via APIs/SDKs and a sandbox with synthetic
      trip/receipt data.

      Platform subscription by volume tier ($2k–$10k/month) including analytics,
      policy engine, and integrations.

      COGS: Platform infrastructure (Kubernetes, databases), event streaming,
      and in-region deployments for data residency.
    - >-
      COGS: Payment integration overhead (webhooks, retries); minimal PSP fees
      as refunds flow through client PSPs.

    Operations and Support leaders at taxi and ridesharing companies who need
    fast, reliable rider issue resolution at scale.
  problem: >-
    Riders flood support with fare adjustments, receipts, promo code problems,
    and duplicate charges. Manual handling is slow, costly, and
    error‑prone—creating churn, refund leakage, and unhappy teams. Riders expect
    instant, fair fixes; leaders need control and compliance.
  guide: >-
    We understand high‑volume mobility support and the risk of touching
    payments. Rider Support Automation is a policy‑aware LLM agent that safely
    resolves Tier‑1 cases end‑to‑end—with guardrails (policy checks, spend
    limits, reversible credits, role‑based approvals, audit logs) and seamless
    integrations (CRM, billing, payments, comms).
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your systems (billing, payments, CRM) and policy docs. 2)
    Configure refund rules, limits, and approval paths; choose copilot or
    autopilot. 3) Launch a supervised pilot, review audits, then expand to more
    issue types.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Get the Tier‑1
    Automation Playbook and ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    24/7 instant resolutions for refunds, receipts, promo fixes, and duplicate
    charges; lower cost per ticket and faster first response; fewer chargebacks
    and errors via payment guardrails; happier riders and agents; consistent
    policy enforcement with full auditability.
  failure: >-
    Queues stay long, costs climb, refund leakage persists, chargeback risk
    grows, and riders churn to competitors.
