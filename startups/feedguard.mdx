leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual COA processing is slow and error-prone: typical plants spend 6–12
      minutes per COA rekeying data from PDFs/emails, leading to delays in lot
      release and missed variances.
    - >-
      Inconsistent COA formats (PDF scans, images, spreadsheets) and units cause
      misinterpretation; key fields (moisture, protein, ash, mycotoxins, micro
      counts, peroxide value, fat, fiber) are often buried in tables or
      footnotes.
    - >-
      Spec escapes occur when COAs that are out-of-spec or missing required
      tests are accepted; typical escape rates of 1–2% create quality risk and
      rework/recall exposure.
    - >-
      Limited statistical process control across lots and suppliers; trends
      (e.g., rising aflatoxin risk by origin, fat rancidity drift) are missed
      until complaints or process failures occur.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (email, spreadsheets, ERP/MES, LIMS) lack an integrated
      hold/release workflow, creating gaps in quarantine discipline and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Supplier performance visibility is weak; no objective scorecards by
      analyte, supplier, plant, or seasonality to inform sourcing and corrective
      actions.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (FDA 21 CFR Part 507 CGMP/HARPC for animal food)
      requires documented verification, record retention, and rapid retrieval
      for audits; manual records are incomplete and hard to search.
    - >-
      Multi-site operations struggle to standardize specs and COA validation
      rules across plants, causing inconsistent acceptance criteria and
      duplicated effort.
    - >-
      Labor constraints and turnover in QA/QC roles make it hard to maintain
      high-quality, timely COA reviews—especially during seasonal volume spikes.
    - >-
      Downstream cost of poor quality (CPK below target, scrap, rework, customer
      claims, lost throughput during holds) is not quantified in real time,
      limiting proactive management.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-native COA ingestion: OCR + layout-aware parsing for
      PDFs/images/spreadsheets, with template learning and confidence scoring
      per field.
    - >-
      Automated validation against purchase specs and required tests: unit
      normalization, method matching, spec range checks, COA completeness
      checks, and automatic pass/fail with rationale.
    - >-
      SPC engine across lots/suppliers/sites: control charts, capability indices
      (Cp/Cpk), drift/anomaly detection, and supplier trend analytics.
    - >-
      Hold/quarantine workflows integrated with ERP/MES/LIMS: auto-create holds
      for failed/missing tests, route for review/approval, and release with
      electronic signatures.
    - >-
      Supplier scorecards and risk flags: on-time COA delivery, pass rates by
      analyte, corrective action tracking, and seasonal/geographic risk
      overlays.
    - >-
      Alerting and collaboration: real-time email/SMS/Teams/Slack alerts for OOS
      results, near-spec warnings, and SPC violations with recommended actions.
    - >-
      Audit-ready records: immutable logs, versioned specs, reviewer sign-off,
      21 CFR Part 11-style e-records/e-signatures, and rapid retrieval for
      audits/recalls.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors: bi-directional integrations to common ERPs/MES (e.g.,
      SAP, Dynamics, Infor, Deacom, Aptean), LIMS, EDI mailboxes, S3/SharePoint.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review screens: side-by-side COA image vs. extracted
      fields, confidence thresholds, bulk actions, and exception queues.
    - >-
      Data normalization: analyte dictionary for animal feed (e.g., moisture,
      crude protein, fiber, fat, ash, peroxide value, FFA, mycotoxins,
      Salmonella/E. coli, minerals, vitamins), method mapping, and unit
      conversions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate supplier COA ingestion and validation with 95%+ field accuracy,
    enforce spec-based holds in minutes (not hours), and surface SPC-driven
    drift alerts—cutting review time by 70–90% and reducing spec escapes by
    60–90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of animal-feed COAs and analyte mappings
    across top suppliers, combined with prebuilt spec/required-test libraries
    and ERP/LIMS connectors—yielding higher auto-accept rates and faster
    time-to-value than horizontal OCR or generic QC tools. Network effects
    improve parsing accuracy and supplier benchmarking as more customers
    onboard.
