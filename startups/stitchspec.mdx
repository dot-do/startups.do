  problem:
    - >-
      Creating production-ready tech packs is slow (3–8 hours per SKU) and
      error-prone, especially for accessories with complex components (hardware,
      finishes, stitch types).
    - >-
      Factories reject or request revisions on 30–50% of first-round tech packs
      due to missing BOM details, ambiguous callouts, or inconsistent
      measurements.
    - >-
      SMB and mid-market brands lack dedicated technical design resources;
      freelancers rely on manual Adobe workflows and spreadsheets with poor
      version control.
    - >-
      Legacy PLM/PD tools are expensive, heavyweight, and not optimized for
      rapid tech pack creation or AI-assisted BOM/spec generation.
    - >-
      Measurement tables and grading rules are inconsistent across categories
      and regions, leading to fit issues and costly sample iterations.
    - >-
      Communication friction with factories (language, terminology, unit
      conversions) causes delays and mistranslations in annotations and specs.
    - >-
      Scaling from dozens to hundreds of SKUs per season overwhelms teams;
      tracking changes and approvals across versions is difficult.
    - >-
      Accessories (bags, SLG, jewelry) have niche requirements (hardware specs,
      finishes, stitch counts, edge paint, reinforcements) not well-covered by
      generalist tools.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted parsing of sketches/photos/3D snapshots to auto-suggest
      components, materials, and stitch/callout annotations.
    - >-
      Category-specific template library (bags, SLG, belts, hats, jewelry, small
      apparel) with preloaded measurement tables and grading suggestions.
    - >-
      Smart BOM builder with hardware/trim libraries and finish options;
      auto-unit conversion and cost rollups.
    - >-
      Auto-generated measurement charts with tolerance presets and regional size
      scales; grading rule recommendations.
    - >-
      One-click multi-language annotations (EN/CN/ES/VI) and factory-ready
      exports (PDF/Excel/CSV + PLM connectors).
    - >-
      Change-log and versioning with side-by-side diffs; factory portal for
      comments/approvals and sample tracking.
    - >-
      Automated QA checks (missing dimensions, inconsistent tolerances,
      conflicting materials) before export.
    - >-
      Feedback loop that learns from sample comments/rejections to improve
      future suggestions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that turns sketches/photos/3D concepts into factory-ready tech packs
    (specs, BOM, stitch/callout annotations, measurements) in minutes, cutting
    drafting time by 60–80%, reducing first-sample rework by 30–50%, and
    standardizing quality across teams and vendors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feedback-trained model and template library focused on accessories,
    enriched by factory-approved outcomes and QC comments; tight loop with pilot
    factories and certified freelancers creates a data and distribution flywheel
    that general PLM tools and generic AI cannot easily replicate.
