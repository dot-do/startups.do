leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Long feedback loop: final malt QC results are often known 12–48 hours
      after kilning, limiting ability to correct mid-batch.
    - >-
      Off-spec and downgrades: 1–5% of lots require rework/blending or are
      downgraded; a rejected 150–250 t lot can cost $60k–$150k in lost margin
      and delay brewery deliveries.
    - >-
      High variability: crop year, variety, field, and storage conditions shift
      moisture uptake, modification rate, FAN, DP, color, leading to operator
      over- or under-processing.
    - >-
      Silo/bed heterogeneity: uneven moisture/temperature and airflow create
      intra-bed variance, causing spec stack-ups that lab sampling misses.
    - >-
      Energy and time waste: conservative over-kilning and extended germination
      add 2–6% energy/time with no quality gain.
    - >-
      Limited predictive tools: existing MES/SCADA trend charts and end-of-line
      NIR lack domain-specific prediction and prescriptive guidance mid-process.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-connected AI models ingest process and sensor data (NIR, temp/RH,
      airflow, CO2, bed depth, moisture probes, turning schedule) to predict
      final specs with quantified uncertainty.
    - >-
      Release Risk Score per batch/SKU: probability of failing contract specs,
      weighted by commercial impact (penalties, downgrade price, customer
      priority).
    - >-
      Prescriptive actions: dynamic kiln profile tweaks, germination
      extension/shortening, turning rate, airflow/recirculation, blending
      suggestions with confidence and expected impact on each spec.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test recipe and schedule changes before executing,
      with predicted deltas for moisture, color (EBC/SRM), FAN (mg/L), DP
      (WK/Lintner), extract, and energy use.
    - >-
      Integration with LIMS/MES/SCADA for automatic data pulls and pushback of
      setpoint recommendations; OPC UA/MQTT-enabled edge gateway for secure OT
      connectivity.
    - >-
      Model governance: per-plant calibration library, variety/crop-year drift
      detection, and semi-automated recalibration workflows aligned to ASBC/EBC
      methods.
    - >-
      Batch genealogy and audit trail: from barley lot intake to final QC
      results and customer shipment for traceability and continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prevent off-spec malt before it happens. Predict final specs (moisture,
    color, FAN, DP, extract, beta-glucans, friability) 6–24 hours before batch
    completion, quantify release risk by customer SKU, and recommend targeted
    adjustments to maximize first-pass yield, on-time release, and margin.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Plant-calibrated, physics-informed ML trained on cross-site datasets that
    predict earlier in the process with calibrated uncertainty and prescriptive
    actions, coupled with OEM/SI integrations and verified ROI case studies.
    Competitors offer general analytics or end-of-line QC, not mid-process
    prediction plus actionable playbooks and risk-sharing contracts.

  character: >-
    Malt plant managers and quality leaders who must release every batch on
    spec, on time, with minimal rework.
  problem: >-
    Final specs (moisture, color, FAN, DP) are only known late, forcing holds,
    blends, and rework; teams fly blind mid-process under pressure; quality
    shouldn’t depend on end-of-kiln guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’re malt operations and data/AI specialists who understand batch
    variability. Our models are calibrated on your historical process and lab
    data, validated before go-live, and delivered with clear, actionable
    guidance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect process and lab data streams; 2) Calibrate and validate
    early-spec prediction and Release Risk Score on your history; 3) Go live
    with real-time predictions and adjustment recommendations.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 60-day pilot on one kiln/line to quantify on-spec lift and risk
    reduction.
  success: >-
    See specs days earlier, adjust steep/germ/kiln to hit targets, raise on-spec
    release rate, cut rework and energy, stabilize schedules, and earn brewer
    confidence.
  failure: >-
    Keep discovering off-spec at release, paying for blends/scrap, missing
    shipments, and eroding margins with every surprised batch.
