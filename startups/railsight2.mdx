leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned wheel/bearing setouts cause costly delays, recrews, and service
      failures; many are preventable with earlier prioritization.
    - >-
      Wayside data (WILD/HBD/ABD) sits in silos with inconsistent formats and
      coverage, making network-wide risk scoring difficult for car owners and
      smaller railroads.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely threshold- or time-based; it misses degrading
      trends and produces false positives that waste shop capacity and parts.
    - >-
      Leased/private fleets traverse multiple railroads; owners lack end-to-end
      visibility to detector streams and repair outcomes to learn across
      networks.
    - >-
      Shops and dispatch need actionable ranks and lead times, not raw alerts;
      current tools don’t translate signals into prescriptive work queues with
      ROI.
    - >-
      Regulators and insurers demand stronger safety leading indicators; current
      KPIs are lagging (derailments, FRA-reportable failures).
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from WILD (Wheel Impact Load Detectors), HBD (Hot
      Box Detectors), acoustic bearing detectors (ABD), AEI movement events, and
      shop/CRB history into a normalized asset timeline.
    - >-
      Predictive models (survival analysis + gradient boosting + sequence
      models) producing per-asset risk scores, estimated distance-to-defect, and
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Prioritized worklist at car, truck, axle, and bearing level with
      recommended action (inspect now, monitor, shop next terminal) and
      rationale features for explainability.
    - >-
      Prescriptive scheduling layer that aligns high-risk assets with shop
      capacity, train plans, and parts availability to minimize dwell and car
      hire.
    - >-
      Integrations to EAM/CMMS (e.g., SAP/Maximo), car repair billing workflows,
      and railroad tasking systems; APIs and EDI where needed.
    - >-
      Governed feedback loop: every repair outcome updates labels to
      continuously improve models and reduce false positives.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A vendor-neutral AI service that fuses WILD/HBD/acoustic detector data with
    shop history to rank railcars by near-term wheel/bearing risk and
    recommended action—turning disparate signals into prioritized, ROI-positive
    work orders that cut unplanned setouts and improve safety KPIs within a
    single planning cycle.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-network, vendor-neutral dataset and models tied directly to repair
    outcomes, combined with prescriptive scheduling embedded in shop
    workflows—hard for detector OEMs or single-railroad teams to replicate.
    Early safety validations, integrations to CRB/EAM systems, and
    insurer-aligned KPIs reinforce defensibility.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Class I railroads (safety, network reliability, reduced setouts/slow
      orders).
    - >-
      Regional and shortline railroads lacking large analytics teams but with
      detector access on host networks.
    - >-
      Railcar leasing companies and private fleet shippers wanting to protect
      assets and reduce car hire/repair bills across multiple carriers.
    - >-
      Railcar MRO networks and mobile repair providers seeking higher shop
      capture, better parts staging, and fewer NFF (no fault found) repairs.
    - >-
      Detector network operators/OEMs looking to add value-added analytics to
      installed WILD/HBD/ABD base.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct enterprise sales to Class I railroads with safety/reliability
      business case and co-developed pilots.
    - >-
      Partnerships with detector OEMs/operators (WILD/HBD/ABD vendors) to
      co-sell analytics on top of their networks.
    - >-
      Alliances with railcar lessors/MRO networks to embed prioritization into
      shop scheduling and mobile repair offerings.
    - >-
      Industry events and associations: AAR committees, ASLRRA, RSI, Railway
      Interchange; publish case studies/white papers with pilot results.
    - >-
      Targeted outbound to private fleets in chemicals/energy/ag where service
      failures are costly; offer 90-day paid pilot.
    - >-
      Integration listings/marketplaces for EAM/CMMS vendors and Railinc-related
      ecosystems (for AEI/CRB workflows).
  revenueStreams:
    - >-
      SaaS subscription per monitored car per year (typical $10–$30/car-year
      depending on coverage, volume, SLAs).

      Tiered pricing by data coverage and refresh rate (detector-only vs
      detector+shop history vs prescriptive scheduling).

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rail mechanical and operations leaders who must prevent wheel/bearing
    failures, reduce setouts, and allocate scarce shop capacity with confidence.
  problem: >-
    - External: Detector alarms are late/isolated; data is siloed (WILD, HBD,
    acoustic) and shop slots are limited, forcing reactive work.

    - Internal: Teams feel unsure which cars to pull first and worry about
    missing a failure or over-pulling healthy cars.

    - Philosophical: Safety-critical assets deserve proactive care; data should
    make decisions clearer, not harder.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pressure of keeping trains moving while avoiding
    wheel and bearing surprises and shop bottlenecks.

    - Authority: Built by rail analytics engineers; integrates WILD/HBD/acoustic
    streams and shop history; delivers explainable risk scoring designed for
    mechanical teams; secure, standards-aligned.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest WILD, HBD, acoustic, and shop data via secure feeds. 2)
    Prioritize: Receive weekly (or on-demand) explainable risk-ranked railcar
    list with recommended actions and pull windows. 3) Act & improve: Issue work
    orders, capture outcomes; feedback continuously sharpens the model.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or launch a 60-day pilot on a subset of
    your fleet. Transitional: Request a sample risk report and ROI snapshot.
  success: >-
    Proactive interventions prevent in-service failures; fewer setouts and slow
    orders; optimized wheel/bearing shop loading; lower total cost per mile;
    audit-ready traceability; safer operations and confident planning.
  failure: >-
    Without prioritization, scattered detector alerts become noise; missed
    bearing/wheel degradations trigger setouts, delays, and safety risk; shops
    stay overrun with reactive work and costs climb.
