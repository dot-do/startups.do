leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, static pricing leaves 3–10% net revenue on the table due to missed
      demand spikes, over-discounting, and late price changes.
    - >-
      Margin leakage of 2–6 pp occurs from ungoverned discount stacking (OTA
      promos + agent codes), FX shifts, and commission changes by channel.
    - >-
      Rate parity/conflict: 10–25% of SKUs have channel undercutting each month,
      harming conversion and partner relations.
    - >-
      Seasonality and event-driven demand are poorly captured; operators react
      days/weeks late due to spreadsheet workflows and limited analytics.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true unit economics by channel (gross-to-net
      waterfall), causing unprofitable sales in low-margin seasons.
    - >-
      No systematic A/B price testing or elasticity learning; reliance on
      gut-feel and legacy rules.
    - >-
      Ops overhead: revenue teams spend 8–20 hrs/week updating price tables
      across systems; errors propagate to customers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based price recommendations that optimize for revenue subject
      to minimum gross margin by channel/season/product.
    - >-
      Commission- and fee-aware pricing: automatically incorporates OTA
      commissions, payment fees, taxes, and FX to price to a net margin target.
    - >-
      Discount governance: rules to cap/stack/blackout promos by channel,
      segment, and date; automated detection of violations with one-click fixes.
    - >-
      Demand forecasting using pickup, web intent, competitor price index,
      weather/events to adjust prices intra-week or daily.
    - >-
      Rate parity and channel undercut monitoring with alerting and
      auto-remediation (e.g., reprice or pause promo).
    - >-
      A/B price testing and elasticity learning to quantify willingness-to-pay
      and reduce risk.
    - >-
      What-if simulation (e.g., +5% price on weekends, new commission structure)
      with projected impact on conversion, ADR, and margin.
    - >-
      Low-latency Price API and admin UI; write-back to reservation systems,
      channel managers, and OTAs where supported.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Set the right price per channel and season—and never sell below your target
    margin. An explainable AI engine with enforceable guardrails, discount
    policy control, and real-time alerts to maximize revenue while protecting
    profit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A tours-specific, constraint-based pricing engine tied to enforceable
    guardrails and deep integrations across the tours tech stack, combined with
    a cross-operator dataset of pickup and price-response signals that improves
    elasticity learning and alert accuracy. Early marketplace partnerships and
    SOC 2 readiness reduce procurement friction and create switching costs.

    conflict. Authority: Our tour-specific pricing AI learns seasonality,
    demand, and competitive signals and enforces guardrails with clear audit
    trails.

    1) Connect bookings, inventory, and channel data. 2) Set margin guardrails,
    seasons, and discount rules. 3) Go live with AI price recommendations,
    parity checks, and alerts; review weekly insights.

    discounts, improved price parity, time saved, and auditable pricing
    decisions—confidence in every rate you publish.
  failure: >-
