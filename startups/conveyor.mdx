  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned conveyor failures (belts, drives, rollers) cause high-cost
      production stoppages underground where access is constrained and restart
      times are long.
    - >-
      Preventive maintenance is often time-based rather than condition-based,
      leading to both over-maintenance and missed incipient failures.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into health of idlers/rollers, belt splices, and drive
      systems due to harsh environment, noise, dust, water ingress, and
      restricted sensor placement.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across SCADA/PLC, condition monitoring, and CMMS prevents
      timely, actionable insights for planners and supervisors.
    - >-
      Regulatory and safety risks (fire from seized rollers, belt friction,
      electrical faults) require early detection and swift remediation.
    - >-
      Skilled maintenance resources are scarce; planners need system-generated
      maintenance windows aligned with production schedules and
      ventilation/permit constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-AI that ingests SCADA/PLC data (motor current, torque, speed, belt
      drift, temperature, vibration where available) and optional intrinsically
      safe sensor nodes (acoustic/vibration/thermal for idlers and drives).
    - >-
      Hybrid models (physics + machine learning) for anomaly detection,
      remaining useful life (RUL) estimates for bearings and drive components,
      and belt damage/splice health indicators.
    - >-
      Automated maintenance window recommendations that align with production
      cycles, manning, ventilation, and permit schedules; push to CMMS (SAP
      PM/IBM Maximo/Pronto) as pre-filled work orders.
    - >-
      Downtime risk scoring by segment (section of beltline, drive station,
      return vs carry, take-up, transfer points) with confidence intervals and
      7–21 day lookahead.
    - >-
      Offline-first edge deployment with daily/shift-based synchronization to
      cloud or on-prem server; role-based dashboards for planners, supervisors,
      and maintenance crews.
    - >-
      Alerting via radio/dispatch/SMS and control room HMI pop-ups; evidence
      packets include trending, spectral signatures, and suggested inspection
      steps.
    - >-
      Post-event root cause analysis and continuous model recalibration using
      labeled outcomes from completed work orders.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict belt, drive, and roller failures 7–21 days in advance and recommend
    maintenance windows that fit production and safety constraints, reducing
    unplanned conveyor downtime by 30–50% and delivering payback in under 6
    months. Works in air-gapped mines via certified, intrinsically safe edge
    hardware and integrates with existing SCADA and CMMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic, intrinsically safe edge-AI platform trained on cross-site
    underground conveyor data and outcomes, combining physics-based features
    with ML to deliver reliable lead times in harsh, low-connectivity
