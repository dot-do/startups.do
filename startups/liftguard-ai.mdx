leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned ESP and rod-lift failures cause 2–10 days downtime per event,
      driving $40k–$150k in deferred revenue per well per failure (assumes
      120–400 bbl/d, $65–$85/bbl).
    - >-
      ESP runlife variability (6–24 months) and rod lift component wear (0.5–1.5
      failures/well-year) strain limited lift-engineering resources and
      spare-parts planning.
    - >-
      Operators rely on disparate OEM dashboards (VSDs, pump card systems,
      SCADA/historian) with alarm fatigue and low actionable signal-to-noise
      ratio.
    - >-
      Root causes (scale, gas interference, solids, electrical/power quality,
      wear) are often identified post-failure; preventable conditions (e.g., gas
      lock, pump-off, sanding) go unmitigated.
    - >-
      Workovers and interventions are reactive, costing $20k–$150k per job, with
      HSE exposure due to last-minute mobilization.
    - >-
      Lack of prescriptive, field-ready guidance delays corrective actions;
      setpoint changes and chemical rates are not systematically optimized.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into model performance and business impact impedes
      adoption and budget approvals.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from SCADA/historians (PI, Ignition), VSDs,
      downhole gauges, power quality, pump cards, and workover logs.
    - >-
      Hybrid models combining physics-informed features (pump efficiency, intake
      pressure, pump-off metrics) with ML anomaly classification and survival
      analysis for runlife.
    - >-
      Prescriptive advisory engine that translates predictions into specific
      actions: VSD speed/torque ramping, gas-lock clearing sequences, pump-off
      control tuning, chemical dose adjustments, choke changes, and proactive
      workover scheduling.
    - >-
      Lead-time targets per failure mode (e.g., gas interference 2–5 days; scale
      deposition 7–21 days; rod-string wear 7–14 days; electrical issues hours–3
      days) with confidence scoring.
    - >-
      Operator-facing workflows: watchlists by asset, auto-generated work
      orders, spares/crew scheduling, and post-action verification with uplift
      measurement.
    - >-
      Edge and cloud deployment options; ability to push setpoint changes to
      controllers via existing control standards (with human-in-the-loop).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: post-mortem labeling from CMMS/workover reports,
      improving mode classification and runlife predictions over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict artificial lift failures 3–14 days in advance and prescribe proven
    actions (setpoint, chemical, workover timing) to cut unplanned downtime
    20–40%, increase MTBF 15–30%, and reduce lift-related LOE 8–15%, all in a
    vendor-agnostic, field-ready workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-lift, vendor-agnostic labeled failure-mode dataset and playbook
    library built with multiple operators and OEM inputs, enabling
    higher-precision predictions and actionable, field-tested advisories.
    Combined physics+ML approach plus edge human-in-the-loop control shortens
    the path from detection to impact. Pay-for-performance optionality aligned
    with operator economics accelerates adoption and trust.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production and artificial-lift teams at crude oil operators who must keep
    ESP and rod-lift wells online and on target.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned ESP/rod-lift failures and noisy alarms drive costly
    downtime and workovers. Internal: Teams are stuck reacting under pressure
    without clear early warnings or actionable guidance. Philosophical: With the
    data already being collected, failures shouldn’t be a surprise.
  guide: >-
    We’re lift engineers and data scientists who understand the cost of deferred
    barrels and emergency rig calls. Our field-informed AI pinpoints degradation
    early, explains why risk is rising, and integrates securely with your
    existing SCADA and workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect SCADA/VSD streams and well history; 2) Get risk scores, likely
    failure modes (e.g., gas lock, pump wear, rod/tubing friction,
    electrical/motor issues), and recommended actions; 3) Prioritize
    interventions, schedule work, and measure impact in your CMMS.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on a representative set of wells. Transitional:
    Request the playbook and a sample advisory report.
  success: >-
    Higher uptime and sustained production, fewer catastrophic failures, lower
    OPEX/workover spend, safer field operations, and a shift to condition-based
    maintenance with predictable, planned interventions.
  failure: >-
    More surprise pump and rod failures, lost barrels, emergency callouts and
    rig time, rising costs, and avoidable HSE exposure.
