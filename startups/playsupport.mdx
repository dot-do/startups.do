  problem:
    - >-
      Holiday and release-day ticket spikes (WISMO, preorders, backorders)
      overwhelm small teams; first response times slip from minutes to
      hours/days.
    - >-
      60–70% of inbound questions are repetitive (order status, returns
      eligibility, product fit like age range, compatibility, scale), but
      knowledge is scattered across product pages, PDFs, and policy docs.
    - >-
      Order status lives in multiple systems (ecommerce platform, shipping app,
      carrier), creating delays and copy-paste errors for agents.
    - >-
      Local game stores and specialty toy/hobby shops can’t staff 24/7; missed
      after-hours chats translate to lost conversions and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Inconsistent policy enforcement (street dates, preorder windows, return
      windows for sealed TCG product) causes refunds, review hits, and brand
      risk.
    - >-
      Existing general-purpose chatbots lack domain context (e.g., TCG
      preorders, miniature scales, RC parts), leading to hallucinations and low
      containment.
  solution:
    - >-
      Retrieval-augmented generation over your live product catalog, policy
      docs, and FAQs to answer product-fit, compatibility, and policy questions
      with citations.
    - >-
      Secure order lookup via Shopify/Woo/BigCommerce APIs and shipping/tracking
      (e.g., AfterShip/ShipStation) to answer “Where is my order?” with
      real-time status and ETA.
    - >-
      Returns/exchanges initiation with eligibility checks and RMA creation via
      Loop/Narvar or native flows; applies street-date and sealed-product
      policies automatically.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop escalation into your helpdesk (Gorgias, Zendesk,
      Freshdesk) with full conversation context and suggested replies/macros to
      cut handle time 30–50%.
    - >-
      Omnichannel coverage: onsite chat, email autoresponder, SMS,
      Facebook/Instagram DMs; consistent answers and unified analytics.
    - >-
      Vertical guardrails: child-safe tone, COPPA-aware data handling (no
      accounts for under-13), and SKU-specific templates (TCG preorders,
      miniature scales, RC parts compatibility).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vertical AI copilot for toy/game/hobby retailers that resolves 60–75% of
    WISMO and policy questions, gives <5s first response 24/7, and increases
    conversion 2–4% via product-fit guidance—without custom training or heavy IT
    work.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt vertical ontology and policy engine for toys/games/hobby (TCG
    preorders, sealed-product returns, scale compatibility) plus partnerships in
    the LGS/toy ecosystem—enabling instant containment and compliant answers
    where generalist bots hallucinate. Continuous RL from real retailer
    transcripts and a curated evaluation harness keep accuracy high through
    seasonal surges.
