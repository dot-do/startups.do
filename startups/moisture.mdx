  problem:
    - >-
      Moisture and water activity (aw) variability post-bake leads to staling,
      cracking, and mold growth, causing 1–4% retailer returns and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Manual moisture/aw checks (grab samples every 30–60 minutes) are lagging
      indicators; corrective actions happen after hundreds of cases are already
      produced.
    - >-
      To hedge risk, plants over-bake and/or over-dose preservatives, increasing
      energy costs and ingredient COGS while compromising texture and flavor.
    - >-
      Ambient humidity, flour lot variability, oven load, and packaging film
      changes drive drift that line operators cannot consistently diagnose in
      real time.
    - >-
      Shelf-life testing is slow (7–30 days); R&D cannot rapidly evaluate
      formulation/packaging trade-offs by route or season.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of route/warehouse conditions (e.g., hot/humid markets)
      leads to mismatch between labeled shelf-life and real performance.
    - >-
      Existing analytics tools are generic; they lack a validated
      tortilla-specific model that ties process parameters to aw, mold risk, and
      rollability over time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge and cloud AI models ingest oven/press/cooler settings, ambient
      conditions, inline NIR readings, packaging film specs, and historical QC
      data to predict post-bake moisture, aw, and shelf-life in real time.
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations (e.g., adjust oven zone 3 +8°C, dwell +3
      seconds, cooling fan speed -10%) to meet target aw/moisture bands per SKU.
    - >-
      What-if simulator to test formulation (oil, gums, calcium propionate),
      film OTR, and route temperature profiles before production—quantifying
      shelf-life impact and cost trade-offs.
    - >-
      Route- and season-aware shelf-life predictions using historical
      warehouse/transport temperatures and humidity; alerting when predicted
      risk exceeds retailer thresholds.
    - >-
      SKU-specific control limits and dashboards for operators and QA, with
      automatic SPC and variance diagnostics (e.g., flour protein shift, ambient
      RH spike).
    - >-
      On-site calibration and periodic validation using accelerated and
      real-time shelf-life studies; continuous learning model improves with each
      run.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict post-bake moisture, water activity, and expected shelf-life by SKU,
    packaging, and route—then prescribe setpoint changes to hit spec every
    shift. Achieve ±0.3% moisture MAE, ±0.02 aw MAE, and shelf-life accuracy
    within ±1 day at 95% confidence, reducing stale returns 20–40% and
    preservative spend 10–20% while improving texture consistency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, physics-informed tortilla-specific model trained on multi-plant
    datasets linking process parameters, aw, packaging, and route conditions to
    shelf-life outcomes; plus pre-built OT connectors and lab-backed validation
    protocols that generic analytics tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tortilla manufacturers who need predictable moisture and shelf-life to ship
    fresher product, cut returns, and protect margins.
  problem: >-
    - External: Variable bake/cool drives off-target moisture; shelf-life is
    guessed after the fact; stales trigger returns and chargebacks.

    - Internal: Teams constantly tweak settings and fight complaints; QA lacks
    confidence at release.

    - Philosophical: You should know shelf-life before product leaves the plant.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of stales and returns. Our team blends bakery science
    with machine learning to predict moisture and shelf-life from your line
    data. Proven on tortilla lines and verified against lab moisture and
    shelf-life tests.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest oven, press, cooling, and lab moisture data without
    changing PLCs. 2) Calibrate: 2–4 weeks training on your SKUs to hit target
    accuracy. 3) Deploy: Live predictions, alerts, and setpoint suggestions at
    oven exit; continuous tuning with weekly reviews. Start with a low-risk
    4-week pilot and a clear ROI report.

      AI predicts post-bake moisture and expected shelf-life from process
      parameters to cut returns and stale product.
    ctaText: Start a pilot
    ctaHref: /pilot
  problem:
    - Inconsistent moisture leads to stale tortillas and retail returns.
    - Over-baking to be safe dries product and wastes energy.
    - Lab results arrive late—issues found after packing.
    - Line-to-line and shift variability from ambient changes and operators.
    - No batch-level shelf-life prediction for scheduling and codes.
    - 'Hard to trace root cause across dough, sheeting, bake, cooling, and pack.'
  solution:
    - Predict post-bake moisture and shelf-life before product leaves the oven.
    - 'Dynamic setpoints by line, flour lot, and weather to hit targets.'
    - 'Early warnings with actionable adjustments for dough, press, and bake.'
    - What-if simulation to meet moisture targets with less energy.
    - Line- and product-specific models that adapt over time.

    - Data quality guardrails and sensor drift detection.
    - Traceability and batch genealogy with audit logs.
    - 'Role-based access, SSO, and multi-plant rollup.'
    - Deploy in cloud or on-prem/edge with low-latency inference.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect line data and import history (process + lab moisture/aw +
      returns).
    - Calibrate models with recent runs; validate against lab measurements.
    - Configure targets by SKU and packaging; define alert thresholds.
    - 'Go live: real-time predictions and recommended setpoints to operators/PLC.'

    - 'Weekly reviews: confirm gains, adjust models, and lock in best practices.'
    - >-
      Measure impact: fewer returns, longer shelf-life, less over-bake and
      energy.
