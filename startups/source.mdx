  problem:
    - >-
      Source water quality (wells/springs) can change rapidly due to rainfall,
      agricultural runoff, intrusion, or equipment drift, causing out-of-spec
      events that halt bottling lines or trigger costly holds/recalls.
    - >-
      Most plants rely on fixed SCADA thresholds and periodic lab tests; these
      miss subtle multi-sensor patterns, seasonal drift, and cross-signal
      correlations—leading to late detection and false alarms.
    - >-
      Quality teams lack an automated, auditable link between anomalies and
      plant SOPs (hold, flush, switch source, sample), slowing response and
      increasing risk exposure.
    - >-
      Integrating multi-source data (online sensors, SCADA, LIMS, weather,
      USGS/river levels) is complex; plants end up with siloed data and manual
      spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Demonstrating regulatory due diligence (21 CFR Part 129, IBWA Model Code,
      HACCP/ISO 22000/FSSC 22000) requires traceable monitoring and response
      records; current tools are not audit-friendly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: Ingest high-frequency signals from online instruments
      (turbidity, pH, conductivity, temperature, TOC, UV254, ORP, color),
      pump/flow/level from SCADA (OPC-UA/Modbus), LIMS microbiology trends (HPC,
      total coliform), weather/rainfall, watershed/USGS data.
    - >-
      AI-driven anomaly detection: Ensemble models (seasonality-aware baselines,
      multivariate correlations, change-point detection) tuned to each source;
      detects sensor drift vs. true water quality changes; quantifies severity
      and confidence.
    - >-
      SOP orchestration: Map detected anomaly classes (e.g., turbidity spike,
      conductivity drift, organic load rise) to plant-specific SOPs (hold,
      switch to alternate source, backwash filters, grab sample); deliver
      step-by-step actions and auto-create CAPA tasks in QMS.
    - >-
      Early warning and prediction: Lead-time forecasts (e.g., heavy rainfall +
      historical patterns → predicted turbidity exceedance in 2–6 hours) with
      configurable risk thresholds.
    - >-
      Audit-ready trail: Immutable incident timeline, acknowledgments, actions
      taken, and outcomes; export to QMS/LIMS; supports 21 CFR Part 129,
      HACCP/ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 documentation.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud: Optional on-prem gateway for low-latency detection and
      resilient operation; cloud for fleet learning and benchmarking across
      sources.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Simple review/labeling of events improves model
      performance; quarterly model tuning included.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect source-water anomalies hours earlier than traditional methods,
    auto-trigger the right SOP, and prove compliance—with explainable AI tuned
    for bottled water sources, prebuilt integrations, and audit-ready records.

    A cross-plant incident library linking multivariate anomaly signatures to
    proven SOP outcomes, continuously learning from diverse aquifers and
    climates; pre-certified connectors to major SCADA/LIMS/QMS; and audit-ready
    reporting mapped to bottled water regulations—raising switching costs and
