  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or rule-based panelization leaves 0.5–3.0% utilization on the table
      for high‑mix, low‑volume jobs, directly increasing laminate cost and press
      time.
    - >-
      CAM engineers spend 20–60 minutes per order on step-and-repeat, rails,
      coupons, fiducials, and scoring/tabbing decisions; rush jobs create
      bottlenecks and overtime.
    - >-
      Inconsistent application of IPC coupon standards (e.g., IPC-2221/6012) and
      customer-specific coupon requirements causes rework, delays, or rejects at
      FA/AOI.
    - >-
      Suboptimal V-score vs. tab-route strategies lead to breakage during
      depanelization or excessive burrs, impacting yields and rework rates by
      0.2–0.8%.
    - >-
      Multi-job pooling to fill panels is rarely attempted due to complexity,
      leaving dead space when compatibility windows exist (board thickness,
      copper balance, finish, press/load constraints).
    - >-
      Design rule constraints (min spacing, copper balance, warpage risk) and
      downstream equipment limits (AOI frame, LDI field, press/platen sizes) are
      not fully captured in current tools, causing late-stage surprises.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal: outcomes vary by engineer and shift, increasing
      variance in utilization and cycle time; turnover or vacations drop
      performance measurably.
    - >-
      Quoting and planning teams cannot quickly simulate best-case panel yields,
      making quotes less competitive or risky.
    - >-
      Late coupon/fiducial/rail mistakes discovered at imaging or AOI cause
      scrap or delay; root-cause data isn’t fed back to improve future
      panelization.
    - >-
      Current CAM tools offer auto panelization but are template-based with
      limited cross-job optimization and no closed-loop learning from
      fab-specific yield and scrap data.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven panel layout engine that ingests ODB++, Gerber X2/X3, IPC‑2581,
      Excellon/NC rout and optimizes step‑and‑repeat, rails, fiducials, and
      coupons against fab-specific constraints.
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization (physics + ML + heuristics) to select V‑score vs
      tab‑route strategy by product mix, material, thickness, copper balance,
      warp risk, and depanelization method.
    - >-
      Multi-job pooling to fill panels when process windows match (thickness,
      stackup class, finish, press recipe) with automatic compatibility checks
      and BOM/route preservation.
    - >-
      Constraint models for AOI/LDI field size, drilling tables, press/platen
      limits, lamination coupons, router bit library, and score blade angles;
      user-editable constraint sets per line.
    - >-
      Coupon generator compliant with IPC-2221/6012 and customer-specific
      coupons; automated placement and inclusion in traveler/FA package.
    - >-
      Scenario exploration: generate 3–5 alternate panels per job with
      utilization and break-strength scores; pick-by-KPI with one click.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning from production: feed yield/scrap/defect codes back
      into models to improve future scoring/tabbing and coupon placement for
      similar builds.
    - >-
      1-click export of ready-to-run panel data (steps, rout/score lines, drill
      files, panel drawings) back into Genesis/InCAM Pro, UcamX, CAM350, or
      IPC‑2581.
    - >-
      Role-based approvals and digital audit trail; enforces sign-offs for
      coupon selection and scoring strategy before release to shop floor.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: on-prem appliance or private cloud with
      ITAR/CMMC-ready controls and no design data leaving customer boundary.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase panel utilization by 0.5–2.0%, cut CAM setup time 50–70%, and
    enforce coupon/fiducial/rail standards automatically—delivering payback in
    under 90 days with secure on‑prem or private cloud deployment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A hybrid physics + ML panelization engine tuned with closed-loop yield data
    from real fabs, combined with deep integrations into incumbent CAM tools and
    secure on‑prem/private cloud deployment suitable for ITAR/CMMC environments.
    Early pilots create a proprietary dataset of panel/yield outcomes across
    materials and processes, improving optimization over time and making results
    difficult to replicate. Pending patents on multi-job pooling with
    equipment-aware constraints and break-strength scoring further defensibly
    differentiate the solution.

    CAM engineers, production planners, and plant managers at bare PCB
    manufacturers (NAICS 334412) who need fast, reliable panelization and
    step-and-repeat.
  problem: >-
    - external: Manual panelization wastes material and time; inconsistent rules
    for rails/coupons/fiducials; suboptimal V-score vs tab-route choices create
    defects and bottlenecks.

    - internal: Constant pressure to hit yield and OTD while reducing cost;
    frustration with tribal-knowledge rules and last-minute changes.
