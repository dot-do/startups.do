  problem:
    - >-
      Customers constantly call/text to ask “What’s fresh today?”, prices by the
      pound, and whether you can fillet/skin/portion — tying up staff during
      peak hours (esp. Thu–Sun).
    - >-
      Variable‑weight pricing and market availability change daily;
      websites/menus are often outdated, leading to frustrated customers and
      lost sales.
    - >-
      Complex order details (cut style, skin-on/off, portion size, pin-bone
      removal) are misheard on the phone and not captured consistently, causing
      remakes, waste, and refunds.
    - >-
      Small teams can’t answer all channels (phone, Instagram DM, Google
      Business Messages, WhatsApp, SMS), so inquiries go unanswered and walk-ins
      churn.
    - >-
      Order queues are fragmented (sticky notes, POS special orders,
      spreadsheets), making prep timing and capacity throttling difficult.
    - >-
      Language barriers (English/Spanish/Chinese/Vietnamese) create friction and
      errors in order taking and product education.
    - >-
      Weather/boat delays create sudden stock changes; staff spend time
      broadcasting updates across channels instead of selling.
  solution:
    - >-
      Embed a chat assistant on website, Google Business Messages, Instagram DM,
      Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and SMS that answers availability, market
      pricing, sustainability/origin, and filleting questions in real time.
    - >-
      Connect to POS (Square/Clover/Lightspeed) or a Google Sheet to read live
      availability and prices; the assistant updates customers with “out of
      stock” and alternatives automatically.
    - >-
      Capture order specifics (weight range, cut style, skin-on/off, pin bones,
      portioning, pickup window) and place the order into the POS special-orders
      queue or a shared Sheet for prep.
    - >-
      Handle variable‑weight pricing with a clear estimate, optional
      deposit/pre‑auth via POS link, and final weight confirmation at pickup.
    - >-
      Throttle orders by pickup slots and prep capacity; auto-message customers
      when slots fill or when weather impacts supply.
    - >-
      Multi-language support (e.g., English/Spanish/Chinese/Vietnamese) for both
      customer chat and staff summaries.
    - >-
      Staff console (mobile-friendly) to view queue, mark
      started/ready/picked-up, and trigger status SMS to customers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
