  title: Weed Control Planner & Spray Window Scheduler (Resistance-aware)
  description: >-
    Design pre- and post-emergence programs aligned with traits and local
    resistance, and schedule optimal spray windows.
  targetUsers:
    - Growers
    - Consultants/agronomists
    - Retailers
  triggers:
    - Seed/trait selection confirmed (pre-season)

    - 'Sprayer specs (boom, nozzle, speed)'
    - Label database access; buffer/sensitive area layers
    - Weather forecast and inversions risk
  steps:

    - 'Add-on: real-time spray window alerting'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 3.5
    overall: 4
  risks:
    - Off-label risk—label is the law
    - Local resistance variability
    - Weather forecast uncertainty affecting timing
  dependencies:
    - Access to current labels
    - Accurate trait info and sensitive areas
    - Grower/operator final approval
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Rapidly evolving herbicide resistance (e.g., waterhemp, Palmer amaranth,
      marestail) varies by county/township; generic programs lead to escapes and
      costly resprays.
    - >-
      Narrow, weather-dependent spray windows; wind/inversions and workload
      cause missed label cutoffs (e.g., dicamba) and drift incidents, leading to
      fines and neighbor disputes.
    - >-
      Trait complexity (Enlist, XtendFlex, LibertyLink, conventional) plus
      label/tank-mix rules create decision overload; mistakes increase risk and
      cost.
    - >-
      Input inflation and razor-thin margins; growers need to maintain control
      while reducing $/acre and passes.
    - >-
      Scheduling and coordination across growers, agronomists, and applicators
      are manual (texts/calls/spreadsheets), causing delays and
      miscommunication.
    - >-
      Limited measurement of outcomes; decisions rely on anecdotes rather than
      localized data and control probabilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Local resistance-aware program design: fuse county/township resistance
      data with field history to recommend pre- and post-emergence programs
      aligned with soybean trait (Enlist, XtendFlex, LibertyLink, conventional)
      and HRAC mode-of-action diversity.
    - >-
      Label-compliant tank mix builder: rates, adjuvants, droplet size/nozzle
      guidance, buffers, PHI/REI, cutoff dates, endangered species checks;
      automatic compatibility checks.
    - >-
      Spray window optimizer: 14-day rolling forecast with hyperlocal
      wind/inversion/temperature thresholds and weed growth-stage model;
      proposes primary and backup windows with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Work planning and dispatch: sequences fields by priority, distance, and
      capacity; exports jobs to John Deere Operations Center, Raven, AgLeader;
      shares with custom applicators.
    - >-
      ROI/risk comparisons: expected control probability, respray risk, and
      total program cost vs local benchmarks; supports what-if scenarios.
    - >-
      Auto recordkeeping and audit trail: captures who/what/when/where, label
      references, weather at spray; generates regulator-ready reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, resistance-aware program design and spray-window scheduling that
    improves weed control consistency, lowers herbicide costs, and reduces
    drift/compliance risk—integrated with existing farm platforms and applicator
    workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset linking product programs, timing, hyperlocal weather,
    and observed outcomes across millions of acres—creating localized control
    and drift-risk models competitors without cross-retailer data cannot
    match—plus a fast-updating, codified label/compliance engine validated with
    university partners.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Row‑crop soybean producers (NAICS 111110) who want clean fields and simple,
    on‑time spraying.
  problem: >-
    Resistant weeds, confusing trait/label rules, and narrow weather‑safe spray
    windows create yield risk, re‑sprays, and compliance stress.
  guide: >-
    We understand every missed window costs bushels. Our resistance‑aware AI
    co‑pilot uses local resistance surveys, trait/label logic, weather and
    inversion risk, and extension best practices to design programs and time the
    pass.
  plan: >-
    1) Add fields, traits, weed spectrum, equipment, and products. 2) Receive
    pre‑ and post‑emergence programs aligned to local resistance, supply, and
    budget. 3) Follow the dynamic spray‑window scheduler with alerts,
    drift/rainfast guidance, and one‑tap records.
  callToAction: Start your first field free or book a 15‑minute walkthrough.
  success: >-
    Cleaner fields with fewer escapes, protected yield, fewer re‑sprays, slowed
    resistance development, compliant records, and confident timing.
  failure: >-
    Weedy harvests, accelerating resistance, off‑target or off‑label incidents,
    wasted passes, regulatory headaches, and lost profit.
