leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High alarm noise and duplicate tickets in wired carrier NOCs cause alert
      fatigue; typical carriers see 1–5 million events/day with >60% being
      non-actionable.
    - >-
      MTTR is elongated by manual correlation and enrichment; L1 analysts spend
      30–45% of time gathering context (topology, change windows, historical
      incidents).
    - >-
      Runbook adherence is inconsistent; risky manual fixes and tribal knowledge
      increase change failure rate (CFR) and SLA penalties.
    - >-
      Siloed tools (NMS, OSS/BSS, ticketing, telemetry) slow handoffs; routing
      to the wrong resolver group occurs in 10–25% of cases.
    - >-
      Auto-remediation is underutilized due to safety/governance concerns and
      lack of explainability/audit trails.
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance (SOX, SOC2, ISO) require strong change approvals and
      traceability that current scripts/automation lack.
    - >-
      Staffing constraints: NOC attrition and difficulty staffing 24x7 coverage
      increase overtime and cost without improving service levels.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-source alarms/telemetry (SNMP traps, syslog, streaming
      telemetry/gNMI, NetFlow/IPFIX, vendor EMS/NMS) and normalize to a common
      event model.
    - >-
      Topology-aware correlation using a telecom-grade graph (L0–L3) to collapse
      symptoms to root cause and estimate blast radius/customer impact.
    - >-
      Ticket enrichment with device config diffs, maintenance window context,
      recent changes, historical incidents, and SLA tier; push to
      ServiceNow/BMC/Jira with structured fields.
    - >-
      Action proposals with safety scores and required approvals; generate
      CLI/NETCONF/REST playbooks aligned to change policies; support
      simulate/dry-run.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: route to correct resolver group; auto-execute
      zero/low-risk actions under pre-approved conditions; capture outcomes and
      auto-learn.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: show why the root cause was inferred and why a remediation
      is safe; full audit trail for compliance.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: reinforcement from analyst feedback; drift detection
      and model validation against golden datasets.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut MTTR 30–50% and deflect up to 40% of L1 tickets by correlating alarms
    into single root-cause tickets, enriching with real-time topology and risk,
    and proposing safe, auditable actions that auto-execute with
    approval—purpose-built for wired carrier networks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A telecom-tuned correlation engine and domain knowledge graph seeded with
    vendor MIBs/telemetry schemas and enriched by real postmortems; an
    explainable, safety-first automation layer with digital-twin simulation and
    strict approval workflows that satisfy carrier governance—reducing risk
    while enabling measurable MTTR and SLA gains.
