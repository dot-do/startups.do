leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Safety-critical HDL and embedded C/C++ reviews are slow and expensive:
      teams spend "20–40%" of schedule on lint triage, coding standard
      enforcement, and compliance documentation for DO-254/MISRA.
    - >-
      High false-positive rates from traditional linters ("35–60%" noise) bury
      critical issues and fatigue reviewers.
    - >-
      Compliance evidence (traceability, rule mapping, waiver rationale, review
      logs) is fragmented across tools; assembling DER-ready packages can take
      "4–12 weeks" per program increment.
    - >-
      Mixed-language designs (VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog plus C/C++) lack a
      unified view; violations cross language boundaries and are missed.
    - >-
      Tool qualification burden and security constraints discourage cloud-only
      AI; many teams need on-prem, air-gapped solutions aligned with DO-330/TQL
      expectations.
    - >-
      Knowledge silos and turnover cause repeated violations and rework; tribal
      knowledge is not systematically captured or reused.
  solution:
    - >-
      Low-noise static analysis across VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog and C/C++ with
      learning-based prioritization tuned for safety-critical code patterns.
    - >-
      AI-authored fix suggestions with patch diffs and rationale; suggestions
      gated for human approval to simplify tool qualification posture.
    - >-
      Rule-to-objective mapping: each finding linked to DO-254
      objectives/activities and MISRA rules, with traceability hooks to
      requirements (DOORS/Polarion/Jama).
    - >-
      Compliance evidence packaging: one-click generation of DER-ready artifacts
      (trace matrices, rule conformance reports, waiver logs with
      justifications, review sign-offs, audit trail).
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: air-gapped on-prem Kubernetes appliance or
      dedicated gov-compliant VPC; no source code leaves customer boundary.
    - >-
      CI/CD and EDA flow integration: GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps, Jenkins,
      Siemens Questa/Design Compiler flows, Synopsys/Cadence, Xilinx/Intel FPGA
      toolchains.
    - >-
      Tool qualification support: packaged data and guidance to support use as a
      Verification Support Tool with DO-330 TQL-5 claims; auto-fixes treated as
      recommendations requiring human review.
    - >-
      Analytics: measurable reduction in findings, mean-time-to-remediation, and
      document assembly time; trend dashboards for programs and suppliers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single-pane AI code review for HDL and embedded C/C++ with DO-254/MISRA
    mapping, low-noise findings, DER-ready evidence packs, and secure
    on-prem/VPC deployment—cutting review and documentation effort by "30–50%",
    reducing audit risk, and accelerating certification without changing your
    EDA/ALM stack.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary standards-to-code knowledge graph and labeled dataset from
    safety-critical pilots enable low-noise findings and high-quality fix
    suggestions; combined with DER-vetted evidence packs, on-prem air-gapped
    inference, and a pragmatic tool-qualification posture (TQL-5 guidance) that
    incumbents and generic AI tools lack.

  character: >-
    Engineering leaders and code owners at NAICS 334511 manufacturers who need
    to ship safety‑critical FPGA/ASIC and embedded software on time with
    audit‑ready compliance.
  problem: >-
    Manual reviews and fragmented tools make DO‑254/MISRA compliance slow,
    inconsistent, and risky—creating schedule slips, audit surprises, and costly
    rework when defects escape.
  guide: >-
    HDL and Embedded Code Review Assistant pairs safety‑critical tooling
    expertise with AI to deliver static analysis, rule mapping to DO‑254 and
    MISRA (C:2012 with latest amendments, C++:2023), and traceable evidence
    packages auditors expect.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your repo/CI and select DAL level, languages
    (VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog, C/C++), and rule profiles. 2) Run automated
    analysis to detect violations with AI-authored fix suggestions and mapped
    objectives/rules. 3) Triage, apply patches, and export evidence: findings,
    waivers, trace matrices, and checklists for SOI reviews. (On‑prem/air‑gapped
    options; read‑only by default.)
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14‑day pilot on your code or book a compliance‑readiness
    demo. Transitional: Download a sample DO‑254/MISRA evidence package and
    mapping sheet.
  success: >-
    Accelerated reviews, fewer defects, and predictable schedules—teams pass
    audits with traceable artifacts, reduce rework, and shorten certification
    cycles while improving code and HDL quality.
  failure: >-
    Persisting with manual, ad‑hoc reviews leads to missed violations,
    late-stage rework, audit findings, cost overruns, and certification delays.
