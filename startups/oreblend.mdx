leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Grade variability and deleterious elements (e.g., As, Sb, Hg, F, Cl, MgO,
      S, P) cause off-spec feed and smelter/refinery penalties that can swing
      monthly revenue by 5–20%.
    - >-
      Blending is often done in spreadsheets or generic planning tools not tuned
      to penalty thresholds, leading to reactive decisions and manual iteration.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of stockpile composition due to sparse sampling and
      lagging assays causes inaccurate blend predictions.
    - >-
      Mine-to-mill constraints (haulage, rehandle, reclaim, crusher limits,
      hardness/abrasion indices) are not jointly optimized with quality,
      creating hidden bottlenecks and cost overruns.
    - >-
      Contracts specify tight grade ranges and max impurity thresholds;
      breaching incurs penalties or rejection but safety margins reduce realized
      value.
    - >-
      Existing optimizers rarely account for uncertainty in grade/penalty
      forecasts, forcing conservative blends that lower NPV.
    - >-
      Short-term and weekly plans diverge from monthly/quarterly targets due to
      poor handoff between planning, plant, and marketing functions.
    - >-
      Rehandle and rework (double-handling stockpiles) add 5–15% to
      mining/processing costs and are not explicitly minimized.
    - >-
      Geometallurgical relationships (recovery vs. mineralogy/grade/deleterious
      elements) are poorly captured, leaving money on the table.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability reduces trust and adoption; planners need
      transparent trade-offs between penalties, recovery, throughput, and costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest geological, stockpile, LIMS, and plant data to build live
      probabilistic models of grades, deleterious elements, hardness, and
      recovery.
    - >-
      Predict penalties and recovery for candidate blends using ML models
      calibrated to each site’s geometallurgy and offtake contracts.
    - >-
      Run a stochastic multi-objective optimizer that balances value, risk
      (probability of spec breach), penalties, rehandle, and logistics
      constraints across horizons (shift, day, week, month).
    - >-
      Provide explainable recommendations and what-if scenarios for planners and
      metallurgists; show trade-offs and sensitivity to uncertainty.
    - >-
      Close the loop with execution: generate reclaim/haulage instructions,
      monitor compliance via fleet systems, and continuously recalibrate with
      new assays and reconciliations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, uncertainty-aware blending that consistently hits spec and
    minimizes penalties while respecting operational constraints—reducing
    penalty costs 10–30%, grade variability 25–50%, and rehandle 5–15%, with
    full auditability and rapid payback (<6 months).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated, uncertainty-aware penalty and recovery prediction stack
    integrated with a stochastic optimizer and real-time stockpile tracking—plus
    a growing library of prebuilt connectors and anonymized cross-site geomet
    patterns that reduce time-to-value to weeks and deliver explainable
    decisions trusted by planners and metallurgists.
