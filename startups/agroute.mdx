leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High transportation cost volatility (spot vs contract) and fragmented
      carrier base increase cost per load by 8–20% vs optimized benchmarks.
    - >-
      Seasonal supply spikes (cotton harvest, tobacco curing, wool shearing)
      cause missed buyer windows and detention; OTIF often <93% for mid-market
      wholesalers.
    - >-
      Manual load building and routing (spreadsheets, phone/email) yields low
      trailer utilization (average 79–84% cube/weight fill) and excess empty
      miles/backhauls lost.
    - >-
      Complex commodity constraints (humidity/contamination rules for
      hides/wool/tobacco; bale density/stacking rules for cotton) are not
      encoded in general-purpose TMS tools, causing quality claims and
      suboptimal co-loading.
    - >-
      High tender rejection rates (10–25%) lead to last-minute spot buys
      (+12–25% cost premiums) and customer service fire drills.
    - >-
      Lack of end-to-end visibility and automated appointment scheduling
      increases detention by 0.4–0.8 hours/load and creates 5–10 manual
      touches/load.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted load building that encodes ag-raw-material constraints
      (moisture, contamination, bale stacking, commodity compatibility).
    - >-
      Multi-pick/multi-drop routing with time windows to meet buyer receiving
      schedules and minimize miles/detention.
    - >-
      Automated carrier tendering with acceptance-propensity scoring and
      fallback plans across contract, core, and vetted spot carriers.
    - >-
      Live shipment tracking (ELD/API/rail events) with predictive ETA and
      exception management; automated appointment scheduling.
    - >-
      Backhaul and consolidation recommendations across lanes, suppliers, and
      buyers; optional rail-truck intermodal planning.
    - >-
      Embedded docs/compliance: BOL, USDA/APHIS certificates, export docs;
      digital PODs and chain-of-custody.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce freight spend 6–12% in 90 days while hitting 98%+ OTIF for
    raw-material loads by combining domain-specific load building,
    multi-pick/multi-drop route optimization, automated tendering, and live
    tracking—purpose-built for cotton, hides, wool, tobacco, and similar
    commodities.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained optimization and tender-scoring engine built on
    commodity-specific constraint libraries and an anonymized benchmark dataset
    for this niche, plus prebuilt CTRM/ERP connectors and association-backed
    relationships—difficult for generalist TMS/route tools to replicate quickly.
