leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Sensor-intensive programs (radar/sonar/IMU/GNSS) generate terabytes per
      mission; teams lack scalable tools to find rare faults, intermittent
      dropouts, or drift across long logs.
    - >-
      Late discovery of sensor drift or miscalibration causes costly
      re-flights/sea trials and schedule slips (weeks to months) during V&V and
      production ramp.
    - >-
      Existing test and DAQ stacks (HIL/SIL, loggers) provide basic thresholds
      but not explainable, cross-sensor anomaly detection with active-learning
      labels tied to mission context.
    - >-
      Data quality issues (time-sync, saturation, quantization, multipath,
      carrier lock loss, thermal effects) propagate into algorithms
      (navigation/trackers) and certification artifacts, increasing safety risk
      and audit burden.
    - >-
      Labeling rare events is slow and inconsistent; SMEs spend high-cost hours
      combing logs without systematic capture of rationales or inter-rater
      agreement.
    - >-
      Operational constraints (air-gapped networks, export control/ITAR) make
      cloud-first ML tools impractical; on-prem MLOps for signal data is
      underdeveloped.
    - >-
      Programs need evidence for standards (ARP4754A/4761, DO-178C/DO-160G, IEC
      61508/IEC 61162) but lack repeatable, queryable data quality and anomaly
      reports.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turnkey connectors ingest lab/flight/sea logs (ARINC 429/664, NMEA
      0183/2000, ROS2 bag, CAN, UDP, vendor ICDs) with deterministic time-sync
      and metadata capture.
    - >-
      Signal-intelligence feature engines: Allan variance/PSD for IMU;
      carrier/phase residuals and DOP for GNSS; CFAR/track residuals, clutter
      maps for radar; beamformed SNR, reverberation indices for sonar.
    - >-
      Hybrid anomaly detection: unsupervised (isolation forests, VAE), weakly
      supervised and rule-augmented detectors with human-in-the-loop triage and
      explanations.
    - >-
      Drift detection and health scoring: CUSUM/ADWIN/KS tests on feature
      distributions; rolling calibration checks; environment-normalized
      baselines (temp, vibration, sea state).
    - >-
      Active-learning labeling workbench: query strategies (uncertainty,
      diversity, novelty), SME rationale capture, inter-rater agreement, and
      lineage back to raw data segments.
    - >-
      ModelOps for secure environments: offline training pipelines, versioned
      datasets/models, reproducible evals, and automated, auditable reports
      aligned to program gates and safety cases.
    - >-
      Deployment modes: on-prem HPC/K8s or secure gov cloud; streaming
      (near-real-time) or batch from data lakes; APIs into HIL/SIL rigs for test
      automation.
    - >-
      Reporting and alerting: anomaly timelines, drift dashboards, and executive
      metrics (re-test hours avoided, detection lead time, false alarms)
      exportable to PLM/QMS/requirements tools.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    issues, rare events, and sensor drift in radar/sonar/IMU/GNSS logs, cutting

    knowledge into reusable, auditable labels via active learning.

  character: >-
    OEM and Tier-1 engineering leaders in radar, sonar, IMU, and GNSS building
    search, detection, navigation, and guidance systems who need trustworthy
    sensor data from lab, flight, and sea tests to ship reliable instruments
    faster.
  problem: >-
    Villain: sensor drift, rare failure modes, and noisy logs hiding in
    terabytes of data. External: inconsistent data quality stalls tests and
    masks defects. Internal: teams can’t trust logs, burn time in manual triage,
    and fear late-stage surprises. Philosophical: high-stakes systems deserve
    data you can trust, not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we’ve wrestled with flaky sensors, brittle heuristics, and schedule
    pressure in aerospace and maritime test campaigns. Authority: domain-aware
    AI for Radar/Sonar/IMU/GNSS, proven anomaly pipelines, active-learning
    labeling workflows, and traceable MLOps aligned to regulated environments.
  plan: >-
    Simple plan: 1) Assess and baseline—ingest sample logs, map sensors, define
    anomaly taxonomy, and set KPIs. 2) Deploy pipeline—stream/ batch detection,
    drift monitoring, and active-learning labeling integrated with your data
    lake, test rigs, and CI/CD. 3) Iterate and validate—human-in-the-loop
    review, thresholds tuning, model versioning, and audit-ready reports.
    Deliverables: dashboards, alerts, labeled event catalogs, and integration to
    issue tracking.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30-minute discovery call and submit sample logs for a
    free anomaly baseline. Transitional: download the pipeline checklist and
    example detection report.
  success: >-
    Earlier detection of rare events and drifting sensors, faster test cycles,
    fewer NFF returns, higher reliability, smoother certification evidence, and
    confident releases for search, detection, navigation, and guidance
    instruments.
  failure: >-
    Hidden drift triggers mission aborts, rework, and delays; defects escape to
    customers; certification setbacks mount; teams drown in logs while critical
    anomalies go unnoticed.
