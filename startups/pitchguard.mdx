  problem:
    - >-
      Manual price checks are slow and incomplete: mid-size MI retailers (5k–50k
      SKUs) typically audit <5% of SKUs weekly, missing frequent competitor
      changes on Google Shopping, Amazon, Reverb, and eBay.
    - >-
      MAP risk threatens vendor relationships: inconsistent detection and
      documentation of MAP violations lead to warnings, chargebacks, or loss of
      dealership status with brands like Fender, Gibson, Yamaha, Roland.
    - >-
      Margin erosion from race-to-the-bottom pricing: without reliable
      competitive context, stores either over-discount (unnecessary margin loss)
      or under-price (MAP exposure).
    - >-
      SKU matching is hard in MI: variants (color, finish, bundles), legacy
      MPNs/UPCs, and retailer-specific naming cause false matches and noisy
      alerts.
    - >-
      Reaction time is too slow: by the time teams respond (often 1–2 days),
      market prices have shifted; MI categories can see multiple price changes
      per day on promoted items.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems: price changes require toggling between POS/ecommerce
      (Shopify, Lightspeed, Rain Retail, Counterpoint) with no single source of
      actionable truth.
    - >-
      Lack of audit-quality evidence: retailers struggle to capture timestamped
      screenshots/URLs and historical logs to dispute MAP violations with
      vendors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified competitive price monitoring across web, Google Shopping, Amazon,
      Reverb, and eBay with near real-time crawls and feeds.
    - >-
      AI-driven MI SKU matching (UPC/EAN/MPN + fuzzy title/attribute matching)
      tuned for variants (finish, pack/bundle, left/right-handed, year/series).
    - >-
      MAP policy management: ingest manufacturer MAP lists (CSV/API), track
      exceptions/promos, automate detection against live prices.
    - >-
      Alerting and workflows: priority-ranked violations and undercut events
      with SLA targets (median alert <15 minutes; p95 <60 minutes),
      email/Slack/MS Teams notifications.
    - >-
      Compliant price recommendations: margin- and MAP-aware suggestions with
      rules (min margin %, price-endings, competitor set) and one-click sync to
      Shopify/Lightspeed/Rain.
    - >-
      Evidence and audit logs: timestamped screenshots, URLs, price history, and
      auto-generated vendor-ready violation reports.
    - >-
      Reporting and ROI: dashboards for margin impact, violation trends by
      brand/SKU/channel, time saved, and realized revenue lift.
    - >-
      Security and governance: role-based access, API keys, SSO (SAML/OAuth),
      and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Protect margins and vendor relationships with MI-specific, fast, and
    accurate MAP and competitor price intelligence. Detect violations within
    minutes, match SKUs precisely across MI variants, and push compliant price
    recommendations directly to your store—reducing price-check time by 60–80%
    and lifting gross margin 0.5–2.0 percentage points on monitored items.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A MI-focused catalog graph and matching models trained on
    guitars/keyboards/drums/accessories with variant/bundle logic; prebuilt
    integrations with MI-favored systems (Rain Retail, Lightspeed) and a growing
    archive of admissible, timestamped evidence for MAP disputes. This domain
    depth enables faster, more accurate alerts and actionable, compliant price
    moves that horizontal tools can’t match.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      (Shopify/BigCommerce/WooCommerce) and 5k–50k SKUs across guitars,
      keyboards, drums, and accessories.
    - >-
      Large omnichannel MI retailers (multi-location) requiring multi-store
      policies, role-based access, and advanced reporting.
    - >-
      Ecommerce-only MI resellers active on marketplaces (Amazon, Reverb, eBay)
      needing marketplace-aware repricing and MAP guardrails.

      MAP compliance tooling for members.
