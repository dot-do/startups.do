  problem:
    - >-
      Retailer chargebacks (label/ASN/routing noncompliance) erode 1–3% of
      wholesale revenue; a mid-market wholesaler at $50M loses $500K–$1.5M
      annually.
    - >-
      ASN (EDI 856) first-pass acceptance rates often sit at 90–95%, creating
      rework, shipment delays, and scorecard hits; each exception can cost
      $50–$300 and add 1–2 days.
    - >-
      Routing requests and carrier appointments are handled in disparate
      portals/emails, causing missed windows; late/unscheduled deliveries
      trigger $150–$500 per PO in fines.
    - >-
      Label noncompliance (GS1-128, UCC-128, carton/pallet labels, VICS BOL)
      leads to reprints at DCs, vendor scorecard demerits, and $25–$150 per
      carton/pallet chargebacks.
    - >-
      Routing guides change quarterly (sometimes monthly) by retailer; teams
      struggle to track and operationalize changes across ERPs/WMS/label
      software.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone processes consume 8–15 minutes per order for rule
      lookups, data validation, and portal entry; at 2,000 orders/month that’s
      267–500 hours of labor.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI compliance copilot trained on major retailer routing guides;
      continuously monitors changes and converts them into executable rules and
      checklists.
    - >-
      Pre-shipment compliance cockpit that validates each PO/shipset against
      retailer rules (pack/ship window, carton/palletization, NMFC,
      accessorials, label specs, ASN data) before release.
    - >-
      ASN generator/validator that maps ERP/WMS data to each retailer’s 856 spec
      and related docs (810/940/945 as needed), with schema checks, test
      harness, and portals for exceptions.
    - >-
      Label service with certified templates (GS1-128/UCC-128, carton/pallet
      labels, VICS BOL) and dynamic data merge; print from BarTender/Loftware or
      cloud print.
    - >-
      Carrier scheduling and routing request automation via APIs or secure RPA
      for retailer portals (e.g., RetailLink, EDI portals, appointment systems)
      with audit trails.
    - >-
      Chargeback prevention scoring: flags high-risk POs, recommends corrective
      actions, and simulates compliance impact pre-release.
    - >-
      Scorecard and analytics: retailer/vendor scorecard tracking, SLA/OTD
      monitoring, and cost-to-serve per order by retailer/channel.
    - >-
      Integration library for footwear-relevant ERPs/WMS/EDI: NetSuite, SAP
      Business One, Sage X3, Blue Yonder, Manhattan, 3PL WMS, SPS Commerce,
      TrueCommerce, B2BGateway, DiCentral.
    - >-
      Exception workflow with root-cause analysis and one-click playbooks (e.g.,
      split-ship guidance, relabeling instructions, ASN rebuilds).
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2 Type II roadmap, SSO, role-based access, PII
      minimization, audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut retailer routing, ASN, and label chargebacks by 60–90% within 90 days.
    Automate 70%+ of pre-ship compliance work and lift ASN first-pass acceptance
    to 99%+, with proactive routing guide intelligence purpose-built for
    footwear wholesale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    guides, connect test EDI/label data, and ship compliant on your next cycle.
  success: >-
    Clean ASNs and labels on first pass, fewer chargebacks, on-time pickups,
    stronger vendor scorecards, reduced manual touches, faster onboarding of new
    retailers, and a calmer team during peak seasons.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing chargebacks, missed dock appointments, label/ASN rejections,
    slipping vendor scorecards, margin erosion from expedites and rework, and
    risk of retailer penalties or delisting.
