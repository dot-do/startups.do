  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on tempering/coating/utilities costs $3,000–$15,000 per
      hour and disrupts delivery schedules, with penalty risks and idle labor.
    - >-
      Quality drift often precedes outright failure (e.g., vacuum degradation
      causing coating pinholes; blower performance drift causing non-uniform
      quench/roller-wave), but plants lack early, quantified warnings.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely calendar- or operator-driven, leading to premature
      overhauls on healthy assets and late interventions on degrading ones.
    - >-
      Existing OEM dashboards show alarms but don’t translate multivariate
      signals into actionable maintenance windows tied to production plans.
    - >-
      Data sits in PLC/SCADA silos; limited analytics, no Remaining Useful Life
      (RUL) estimates, and high false-alarm rates erode operator trust.
    - >-
      Plants struggle to connect asset health to quality/scrap KPIs, making it
      hard to justify proactive maintenance investment.
    - >-
      Integrating alerts into CMMS (SAP PM, Maximo) and shift workflows is
      manual, slow, and inconsistent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud platform ingesting PLC/SCADA and sensor data (OPC
      UA/Modbus), with on-edge anomaly detection and cloud RUL models for
      blowers, vacuum pumps, and compressors.
    - >-
      Quality-linked risk scoring: correlates health signals (vibration, vacuum
      level, temperature, current, pressure, dewpoint) with line quality KPIs
      (haze, pinholes, roller-wave, coating defects) to alert before quality
      impact.
    - >-
      Maintenance window recommendations: proposes x-hour windows within the
      next 2–6 weeks aligned to production schedules, with expected risk
      reduction and spare parts list.
    - >-
      CMMS integration: auto-create work orders with task templates, parts, and
      labor estimates (SAP PM, Maximo, eMaint, Fiix).
    - >-
      Operator workflow: mobile/desktop alerts, clear root-cause hypotheses, and
      confidence levels; “Why Now?” explanations to build trust.
    - >-
      Rapid retrofit kit: non-invasive sensors and gateway; typical line online
      in <2 days without production interruption.
    - >-
      Post-event learning: failure/maintenance outcomes captured to continuously
      improve models and site-specific thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Line-aware predictive maintenance that turns blower, vacuum pump, and
    compressor signals into defect-preventing maintenance windows. We predict
    failure risk and quality impact, not just anomalies—reducing unplanned
    downtime 30–50% and scrap 10–20% with zero-downtime deployment and
    CMMS-integrated work orders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Quality-aware PdM tuned to flat glass. Our models are trained to predict not
    just failure but defect probability tied to specific process windows (e.g.,
    vacuum drift → pinholes), plus OEM-sourced failure signatures and task
    packs. Edge-first design delivers sub-minute alerts without extra IT burden,
    and our CMMS playbooks turn predictions into scheduled work with high
    operator trust.

  character: >-
    Plant leaders in flat glass manufacturing—operations, maintenance, and
    quality—responsible for tempering, coating, and utilities uptime and product
    quality.
  problem: >-
    Critical assets (blowers, vacuum pumps, compressors) degrade silently,
    triggering quality drift, unplanned downtime, scrap, and costly rush
    repairs—leaving teams firefighting and guessing when to intervene.
  guide: >-
    We understand glass processes and maintenance. Our AI learns from your
    SCADA/PLC, vibration, and process data to predict failure risk and recommend
    maintenance windows before quality is impacted—deployed securely and proven
    in production.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data securely; 2) Calibrate models on your lines; 3) Get risk
    scores and recommended maintenance windows in your workflow; 4) Review
    results monthly and scale sitewide.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot on one line.
  success: >-
    Maintenance is planned, not reactive; failures are predicted days to weeks
    ahead; coating uniformity and optical clarity are protected; unplanned
    downtime and scrap drop; OEE improves; asset life and energy efficiency
    increase; teams operate with confidence.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing reactive breakdowns, quality escapes and rework, missed shipments,
    emergency spend, technician burnout, and rising operating costs.
