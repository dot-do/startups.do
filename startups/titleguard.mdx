  problem:
    - >-
      Trust, fiduciary, and custody teams must ensure every asset is correctly
      titled to the trust/estate and that EINs/beneficiaries are accurate, but
      current processes are manual, fragmented, and error-prone.
    - >-
      Annual fiduciary account reviews (e.g., OCC 12 CFR 9) require documented
      verification of titling and registrations; inconsistent audit trails lead
      to exam findings and remediation costs.
    - >-
      Data is scattered across custodians, recordkeepers, insurers, county
      recorders, and internal DMS; reconciling names, TINs, and beneficiaries
      across systems is slow (30–90 minutes per account).
    - >-
      Mis-titled assets cause tax/reporting errors (e.g., grantor vs non-grantor
      trust TIN use), delays in distributions, and exposure to beneficiary
      disputes—often discovered only during audits or at death/incapacity
      events.
    - >-
      Staffing constraints and backlogs create SLA breaches; firms lack clear
      metrics for % assets verified, exception aging, and remediation closure
      rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion across custodians, DMS, county/property data, and
      insurer/recordkeeper files; normalize holdings to a canonical asset
      schema.
    - >-
      AI-driven extraction and entity resolution to match trust names, trustees,
      TINs/EINs, successor clauses, and beneficiary designations; detect naming
      variants and typographical errors.
    - >-
      Rules engine with jurisdictional logic: applies titling/EIN/beneficiary
      rules by asset type, trust type (grantor vs non-grantor), and
      state-specific requirements; versioned and auditable.
    - >-
      Exception management workflow: queues by severity and asset class;
      auto-generates correction letters/forms and counterparty outreach
      packages; tracks owner/ageing/SLAs.
    - >-
      Audit-ready evidence: immutable trails of source docs, parsed fields, rule
      evaluations, user actions, timestamps, and approvals; export to exam packs
      and trust review memos.
    - >-
      Risk dashboards and KPIs: % correctly titled, exception rate by asset
      class, average time-to-clear, high-risk patterns (e.g., mismatched EINs on
      non-grantor trusts).
    - >-
      APIs and low-code connectors for trust accounting/wealth platforms to
      embed verification into onboarding and annual reviews.
    - >-
      Security and compliance by design: data minimization, field-level
      encryption, role-based access, data residency controls, SOC 2 Type II
      program, and DPIAs where applicable.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Regulatory-grade, automated titling and registration verification that
    reduces annual review time by 60–80%, cuts exception backlogs by half within
    90 days, and delivers a defensible audit trail across all major asset
    types—accounts, real property, insurance/annuities, retirement plans,
    entities—aligned to the correct trust/EIN/beneficiary designations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, jurisdiction-aware rule library tied to an immutable
    audit trail and benchmarked model performance, combined with prebuilt
    connectors covering the majority of fiduciary asset flows—making exams
    faster and creating high switching costs once embedded in annual review
    workflows.
