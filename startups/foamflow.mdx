leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile energy costs and thin margins: energy typically 8–20% of COGS;
      price spikes (electricity +15–40%, gas +20–60% YoY in some regions)
      squeeze margins.
    - >-
      Highly variable steam demand from pre-expansion and molding cycles causes
      boiler short-cycling, high excess O2, and stack losses.
    - >-
      Compressed air systems run 24/7 with poor sequencing and 15–35% leak
      rates; specific power often >22 kW/100 cfm vs best-in-class 16–18.
    - >-
      Manual setpoints and rules-of-thumb lead to chronic over-pressurization
      (steam headers 5–15 psi above need) and unnecessary purge/blowdown.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: few plants have continuous metering on steam,
      condensate return, or air flow; no production-normalized M&V to prove
      savings.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from steam trap failures, wet steam, or compressor
      trips; no predictive alerts tied to production cycles.
    - >-
      ESG pressure to cut Scope 1 and 2 without capex-heavy retrofits; need
      fast-payback operational savings and audit-ready reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to existing PLC/SCADA, historian, and meters; add low-footprint
      sensors where gaps exist (steam flow, header pressure, condensate return,
      compressor flow/pressure).
    - >-
      Build an EPS-specific digital twin: segment pre-expansion, aging, molding,
      drying cycles; forecast steam/air loads from production schedules and
      ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Optimize in closed-loop (optional) or advisory mode: dynamic boiler
      pressure, O2 trim targets, blowdown scheduling, compressor sequencing, and
      receiver management.
    - >-
      Continuous leak detection: pressure decay tests during idle windows;
      ultrasonic/AI correlation to quantify leak load and prioritize repairs.
    - >-
      Automated M&V per ISO 50015: normalize for production, temperature, and
      product mix; provide verified savings dashboard and reports for utility
      incentives.
    - >-
      Operator-first workflows: setpoint change proposals with risk scoring,
      interlocks, and one-click rollback; change logs for audits (MOC).
    - >-
      Safety and cybersecurity: read-only commissioning, ISA/IEC 62443-aligned
      architecture, site-level edge compute with fail-safe modes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce plant energy intensity 10–20% in 90 days by orchestrating boilers,
    compressors, and steam users with EPS-specific AI—production-aware load
    shaping, automated setpoint tuning, and continuous leak detection, all with
    audit-ready M&V and optional performance-based pricing.

  character: >-
    Operations and energy leaders at polystyrene foam plants who must hit
    throughput and quality targets while cutting utility spend and
    carbon—without risking downtime.
  problem: >-
    External: Leaks, pressure swings, wet steam, short-cycling boilers,
    compressor waste, and drifting setpoints inflate kWh/therms. Internal: Teams
    are stuck firefighting with limited visibility across boilers, compressors,
    and steam users. Philosophical: Reliable foam production shouldn’t require
    wasting energy and budget.
  guide: >-
    We understand steam and air systems in foam manufacturing—pre-expanders,
    block and shape molding, drying, and vacuum. Built by energy engineers and
    data scientists, with proven analytics, M&V-grade savings, and secure
    integration to PLC/SCADA—no rip-and-replace.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest PLC/SCADA tags, meters, and utility bills. 2) Diagnose:
    baseline loads, detect leaks, right-size setpoints, and find root causes. 3)
    Optimize: apply load shaping, scheduling, and targeted alerts. 4) Verify &
    scale: M&V reports, operator coaching, and continuous tuning.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute assessment and site data review. Transitional:
    Start a no-risk 60–90 day pilot with clear M&V.
  success: >-
    Cut 8–20% energy use, stabilize steam pressure, reduce trips, speed
    startups, and lower scrap from moisture/temperature swings. Operators gain
    clear setpoints and alerts; leaders get verified savings and ESG reporting;
    the system improves week over week.
  failure: >-
    Keep paying for leaks and off-spec steam, endure unplanned downtime, miss
    ESG targets, and lose margin to rising energy prices—while competitors
    modernize.
