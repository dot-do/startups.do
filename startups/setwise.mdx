  problem:
    - >-
      Hatcheries struggle to align egg sets with fluctuating orders across
      multiple sites, setter/hatcher banks, and strict biosecurity constraints.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheet planning cannot reliably account for variable
      fertility/hatchability by flock age, egg storage days, and
      seasonality—causing 0.5–2.0% lost hatchability and missed orders.
    - >-
      Idle capacity and bottlenecks (e.g., hatcher or vaccination line
      throughput) lead to overtime, underutilized setters, or emergency
      purchases/culls.
    - >-
      Frequent last-minute changes (fertility shifts, logistics, sanitation
      downtime) force reactive rescheduling, increasing errors and labor time.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to KPI trade-offs (hatchability vs. fulfillment vs.
      logistics cost) and no standardized what-if analysis.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predictive hatchability engine: models hatch % by flock, egg age, storage
      conditions, season, and breed/line to forecast viable chicks available by
      date/site.
    - >-
      Optimization and allocation solver: mixed-integer programming that assigns
      eggs to setters/hatchers/sites and delivery windows to maximize
      hatchability and order fill, with capacity, sanitation, biosecurity, and
      labor constraints.
    - >-
      Dynamic rescheduling: re-optimizes in minutes as inputs change (fertility
      updates, machine downtime, order edits).
    - >-
      Scenario planning: compare multiple plans (e.g., prioritize hatchability
      vs. on-time fill vs. overtime reduction) with quantified outcomes.
    - >-
      Integrated order and capacity calendar: unified view across sites, with
      constraint libraries (egg age limits, crate types, vaccination throughput,
      truck windows).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Meet every order at the lowest cost while maximizing hatchability and
    capacity use—an AI-powered, constraint-aware scheduler that turns variable
    eggs, equipment, and orders into a reliable, high-yield plan in minutes
    instead of hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated, multi-site optimization engine trained on cross-hatchery
    datasets linking egg storage profiles and flock characteristics to hatch
    outcomes, combined with ready-made connectors to leading OEM/ERP systems and
    a constraint library tailored to real hatchery SOPs. This enables fast,
    accurate plans that incumbents’ generic scheduling tools and spreadsheets
    cannot match.

  character: >-
    Hatchery managers and planners at commercial poultry hatcheries (NAICS
    112340) who must hit order quantities and quality targets every set while
    maximizing capacity and minimizing waste.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile egg supply by flock and age, uneven demand,
    machine/sanitation windows, and strict biological constraints. Internal:
    spreadsheet planning, late changes, and siloed data lead to over-sets,
    stockouts, and stressful fire drills. Philosophical: meeting orders
    shouldn’t require risky guesses or sacrifice chick quality and margin.
  guide: >-
    We understand hatchery scheduling—egg age limits, breeder age curves,
    setter/hatcher constraints, biosecurity, and delivery windows. Our team
    blends optimization science with poultry expertise and integrates with
    existing systems to deliver transparent, auditable plans.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders, egg inventory, hatch curves, and machine calendars. 2)
    Configure business rules and priorities (egg age limits, flock preferences,
    customer SLAs). 3) Run the optimizer to publish a weekly plan with daily
    updates; review what-ifs; start with a single-site pilot and scale.

    Transitional: Download the Hatchery Planning Checklist and ROI estimator.
  success: >-
    On-time order fulfillment with higher hatchability and better setter/hatcher
    utilization. Fewer last-minute swaps, less over- or under-setting, clearer
    labor and logistics planning, improved chick uniformity, and audit-ready
    traceability—planning confidence every week.
  failure: >-
    Missed orders, wasted capacity, late hatches, age-driven quality issues,
    overtime fire drills, and margin erosion from guesswork and fragmented
    spreadsheets.

    subtitle: >-
      AI planning for poultry hatcheries. Set the right eggs, in the right
      machines, at the right time to fill orders, boost hatchability, and
      maximize capacity.
    ctaText: Book a demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Shifting orders break static spreadsheets and whiteboards.
    - 'Under/over-setting leads to shortfalls, culls, and wasted capacity.'
    - 'Egg age, breeder age, and fertility variability make timing complex.'
    - Setter/hatcher bottlenecks cause idle trays or overtime hatches.
    - Sanitation windows and vaccine profiles complicate sequencing.
    - 'Data is scattered across ERP, farms, labs, and the hatchery floor.'
    - Last-minute changes ripple across sites and routes.
    - 'Hard to balance fill rate, hatchability, and cost without visibility.'
  solution:
    - 'Optimizes which eggs to set, where, and when to hit order quantities.'
    - Allocates eggs to customers and chick types to maximize fill and quality.
    - Models hatchability by egg and breeder age to lift take-off rates.
    - 'Balances capacity across setters, hatchers, rooms, and sites.'
    - >-
      Enforces rules: sanitation downtimes, vaccine/sex profiles, and
      shelf-life.
    - 'Replans in real time as inventory, fertility, and demand change.'
    - Runs scenarios to test what-ifs before committing.
    - 'Outputs clear, executable set plans and load sheets.'
  features:
    - Demand-aware scheduling aligned to delivery dates and routes.
    - 'Hatchability curves by flock, egg age, and storage conditions.'
    - 'Multi-site, multi-machine constraint optimization.'
    - Setter-to-hatcher pairing and hatch-window control.
    - 'Vaccine, sexing, and product profile sequencing.'
    - 'Shelf-life, storage, and pull-age limits enforced.'
    - 'Live ERP, farm, and lab data integration (API/CSV).'
    - >-
      Exception alerts for projected shortfalls, late hatches, and overpull
      risk.
    - 'Auto-generated set cards, machine loads, and chick allocation lists.'
    - Drag-and-drop adjustments with instant KPI impact.
    - 'KPI dashboards: fill rate, hatchability, capacity use, waste, labor.'
    - 'Audit trails, roles/permissions, SSO, and secure cloud hosting.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect orders, flock, fertility, and machine capacity data.'
    - 'Set goals and constraints: fill targets, hatch windows, and rules.'
    - Import egg inventory and demand forecast.
    - Run optimizer and review the recommended plan and KPIs.
    - 'Approve, publish to floor, and generate set/load documents.'
    - >-
      Monitor execution, handle exceptions, and auto-replan as conditions
      change.
