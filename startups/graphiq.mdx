  problem:
    - >-
      Manual SPC and CoA workflows in carbon/graphite manufacturing are slow,
      error-prone, and inconsistent across plants; typical CoA release times are
      6–48 hours with 1–3% transcription errors.
    - >-
      LIMS and MES store rich process/quality data but are underutilized for
      real-time control; engineers spend 4–10 hours/week exporting to
      Excel/Minitab, delaying detection of drift and special causes.
    - >-
      Customers (steelmakers, battery OEMs, aerospace) increasingly require
      tighter specs, full traceability, and on-time CoAs; late or inconsistent
      CoAs cause shipment holds and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Existing SPC tools are generic and not tuned for carbon/graphite CTQs
      (e.g., resistivity, porosity, ash, density) or heat-treatment cycle
      analytics, leading to high false alarms and low adoption.
    - >-
      Multi-plant organizations lack standardized CoA templates tied to ASTM/ISO
      methods, causing rework and customer-specific formatting effort (0.5–1.5
      FTE per plant).
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time SPC engine that ingests LIMS/MES/historian data to compute
      I-MR/Xbar-R/P charts, Cp/Cpk/Pp/Ppk, and applies Western/Nelson rules plus
      EWMA/CUSUM for early drift detection.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned anomaly models for carbon/graphite (e.g., heat-treatment
      profile deviations, binder/pitch ratio anomalies) to minimize false
      positives and catch latent quality risks.
    - >-
      Automated CoA generator linked to each customer’s spec and test method
      library (ASTM, ISO, IEC), with template management, e-signatures (21 CFR
      Part 11-style controls), and full audit trails.
    - >-
      Spec and limit governance across plants, including unit normalization,
      method equivalency mapping, and golden-batch baselining to standardize
      capability reporting.
    - >-
      Connectors and APIs for common LIMS (LabWare, LabVantage, SampleManager),
      MES (Opcenter, FactoryTalk, SAP QM), and historians (OSIsoft PI,
      Ignition), deployable on-prem or VPC.
    - >-
      Validation and compliance toolkit (IQ/OQ/PQ templates, audit reports,
      electronic records/username-password controls) aligned to ISO/IATF/AS9100
      expectations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native SPC and auto-CoA platform purpose-built for carbon/graphite:
    real-time control charts, Cp/Cpk, and anomaly detection directly from
    LIMS/MES, with customer-specific, ASTM/ISO-linked CoAs auto-drafted and
    e-signed in hours instead of days—reducing scrap 1–3%, CoA errors 50–80%,
    and manual effort 30–60%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific SPC and CoA engine tuned to carbon/graphite processes with
    a ready-made library of CTQs, ASTM/ISO method mappings, and customer CoA
    templates, plus validated connectors to leading LIMS/MES. This reduces
    implementation from 6–12 months to 6–8 weeks and delivers lower false alarm
    rates than generic SPC tools—creating switching friction and defensible
    differentiation.

  character: >-
    QA managers and process engineers at carbon/graphite manufacturers who must
    release every lot on time with proof of conformance.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual SPC in spreadsheets and hand-built CoAs from LIMS exports
    are slow, error-prone, and hard to audit.

    Internal: Fear of missing trends, shipping late, or issuing a CoA with the
    wrong spec or test value.

    Philosophical: Quality data should be trusted, instant, and
    audit-ready—without nights and weekends lost to paperwork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the late-night CoA scramble, scattered test data, and audit
    anxiety.

    Authority: Built by quality engineers; integrates with common LIMS; supports
    audit-readiness for ISO 9001/IATF 16949/AS9100 environments with
    traceability, review/approval workflows, and electronic records controls.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect to your LIMS; 2) Auto-ingest specs, methods, and
    history; 3) Continuous SPC (X̄-R, X̄-S, Cpk/Ppk) with rule-based anomaly
    alerts; 4) Auto-draft CoAs with methods, specs, and results; 5) Reviewer
    approves, e-signs, and publishes.

    Agreement: Clear roles and permissions, encryption at rest/in transit,
    SSO/Audit logs, and a low-risk pilot before full rollout.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 30-day pilot on a selected product
    family.

    Transitional: Download a sample CoA/SPC packet and the LIMS integration
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Faster lot release, fewer CoA errors, proactive detection of drift, reduced
    scrap/rework, clean audit trails, higher customer trust, and confident,
    data-driven process control across carbon/graphite lines.
  failure: >-
    Avoid late shipments, audit findings, tribal spreadsheet dependency, missed
    trends leading to out-of-spec lots, rework costs, and customer complaints
    over incorrect or inconsistent CoAs.
