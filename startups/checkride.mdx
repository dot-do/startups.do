  problem:
    - >-
      Student pilots and pilots pursuing new ratings struggle to assess true
      checkride readiness; practice is fragmented and non-adaptive.
    - >-
      Oral portion anxiety is high due to open-ended questioning; most study
      materials are static and fail to mirror a DPE’s probing style.
    - >-
      Practical test prep lacks integrated scenario checklists aligned to ACS
      tasks; many candidates miss risk management and systems knowledge under
      stress.
    - >-
      CFIs have limited time to run full mock orals; scheduling DPE/CFI mock
      sessions is costly ($75–$150/hr) and scarce.
    - >-
      Flight schools lack consistent, measurable readiness indicators across
      students and instructors.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven mock oral that adapts to the candidate’s aircraft, local
      procedures, and prior answers; evaluates against ACS knowledge, risk
      management, and skill areas.
    - >-
      Automated readiness score with rubric-level analytics mapped to ACS tasks;
      highlights weak areas and recommended remediation order.
    - >-
      Targeted study plans that link specific knowledge gaps to FAA handbooks,
      POH sections, and scenario-based practice.
    - >-
      Scenario checklists for practical prep (preflight risk, abnormal/emergency
      flows, maneuver callouts) to use during lessons and solo practice.
    - >-
      CFI dashboard to assign/schedule mocks, view student analytics, and run
      stage-check style reviews.
    - >-
      Progressive test mode (rising difficulty), exam mode (DPE style), and
      confidence mode (explain-in-own-words) with audio/voice support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Adaptive, ACS-aligned mock orals with an AI examiner that think like a DPE,
    pinpoint gaps, and generate targeted study plans; paired with practical test
    scenario checklists to build muscle memory and confidence—so you walk into
    the checkride knowing you’re ready.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving corpus of real-world, anonymized mock/debrief
    transcripts mapped to ACS rubrics—curated by CFIs/DPE advisors—enabling
    highly realistic probing and personalized remediation that static prep
    materials cannot match.
