  problem:
    - >-
      Isocyanate exposures (e.g., MDI, TDI, HDI) are a leading cause of
      occupational asthma; facilities struggle to detect short-term peaks and
      manage cumulative exposure risk across shifts and SEGs.
    - >-
      Industrial hygiene workflows are fragmented: lab results arrive days later
      as PDFs; area and wearable data sit in separate portals; calculations for
      8-hr TWA and 15-min STEL are done in spreadsheets, increasing error risk.
    - >-
      Audits require traceability (chain-of-custody, calibration, sampling logs,
      OEL basis). Compiling compliant reports and corrective actions can take
      10–40 hours per audit/site.
    - >-
      Corporate EHS teams lack visibility across plants to proactively reduce
      exceedances; they rely on periodic sampling instead of continuous insight
      and early warnings.
    - >-
      Existing EHS suites are generic and slow to implement; hardware portals
      are device-centric and not optimized for isocyanate-specific analytics or
      regulatory reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from personal sampling (pumps/badges), area
      monitors, and lab EDDs; automated time-alignment with shifts/SEGs.
    - >-
      Isocyanate-specific analytics engine computing 8‑hr TWA, 15‑min rolling
      STEL, task-based exposures, and Bayesian exposure modeling for SEGs.
    - >-
      Configurable OEL library (OSHA PELs, NIOSH RELs, ACGIH TLVs, company
      limits) with versioning and site-level overrides; change log for audit
      defense.
    - >-
      Real-time and near-real-time exceedance alerts with workflow for
      containment, investigation, and CAPA assignments; escalation rules by
      severity.
    - >-
      Auto-generated compliance pack: sampling plans, chain-of-custody,
      calibration logs, exposure calculations, OEL basis, trend charts, CAPA
      evidence, and management sign-off.
    - >-
      Integration connectors (APIs/CSV) for labs, hardware portals, LIMS/CMMS,
      and corporate EHS systems; SSO and role-based access.
    - >-
      Program optimization: recommend sampling frequency by SEG, flag data gaps,
      and simulate impact of engineering controls/ventilation changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One platform to unify personal and area monitoring, compute accurate
    TWA/STEL against current OELs, alert on exceedances in minutes, and
    auto-generate audit-ready compliance reports—reducing exceedances and
    cutting reporting time by 70%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Isocyanate-focused analytics with validated lab/device integrations and an
    OEL knowledge graph purpose-built for diisocyanates—delivering audit-ready

  problem:
    - 'Fragmented sampling data (badges, pumps, area monitors) slows decisions.'
    - >-
      TWA/STEL calculations are manual, error-prone, and inconsistent across
