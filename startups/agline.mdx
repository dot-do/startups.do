  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on CNCs, weld cells, presses, and conveyance chains
      causes cascading line stoppages that cost $8,000–$40,000 per hour in lost
      throughput, premium freight, and labor idle time.
    - >-
      Most plants operate on time-based or reactive maintenance, missing early
      failure signatures (e.g., spindle bearing wear, weld gun tip degradation,
      press hydraulic leaks) that are visible in control/condition data days to
      weeks in advance.
    - >-
      Legacy/brownfield equipment lacks native telemetry; data is siloed across
      PLCs, robots, HMIs, CMMS, and SCADA, making cross-asset analytics and
      root-cause analysis slow and manual.
    - >-
      Generic anomaly detection creates alert fatigue (high false positives) and
      lacks explainability for maintenance techs and operators.
    - >-
      Integrations to CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo/Fiix) and plant IT/OT are complex,
      leading to long pilots that fail to scale.
    - >-
      Skilled maintenance labor is scarce; plants need prioritization and guided
      actions, not just alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge + cloud platform that ingests PLC/robot/CNC signals (OPC UA,
      Modbus/TCP, EtherNet/IP, MTConnect, FANUC FOCAS), vibration/temperature
      sensors, and SCADA/CMMS events.
    - >-
      Asset-specific models: templates for CNC spindles/axes, weld cells
      (current/voltage/duty cycle/gun force), presses (tonnage/pressure/ram
      velocity), and conveyors (motor current/torque) using semi-supervised
      learning and physics-informed features.
    - >-
      Real-time anomaly detection and rolling failure-risk scoring with forecast
      horizons (minutes for acute anomalies; 24–72 hours for wear-related
      issues).
    - >-
      Closed-loop actions: automatically create prioritized work orders in SAP
      PM/Maximo/Fiix with recommended checks, parts, and estimated
      time-to-failure; notify via SMS/Teams/Email.
    - >-
      Downtime root-cause analytics: correlate alarms, operator notes, and
      sensor trends to identify systemic causes (e.g., upstream part quality vs.
      machine condition).
    - >-
      Rapid pilot playbook: 8-week, 10–20 asset pilot with success criteria
      (≥10% downtime reduction or ≥80% alert precision) and scale plan.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime on critical fabrication assets by 15–30% within 6
    months via AI that learns your specific machines, predicts failures 24–72
    hours ahead, and auto-triggers work orders in your CMMS—built for brownfield
    ag equipment manufacturing lines with fast deployment and low false alarms
    (<5%/asset-week).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized asset models for fabrication lines (CNC/weld/press/conveyance)
    with explainable predictions and prebuilt CMMS automations; brownfield-first
    edge architecture with rapid connectors; growing proprietary library of
    labeled failure signatures from ag equipment plants enabling faster, more
    accurate predictions than generalist platforms.
