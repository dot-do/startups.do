  problem:
    - >-
      Converting soil lab results into variable-rate lime and gypsum
      prescriptions is manual, inconsistent across labs, and takes 30 to 90
      minutes per field for agronomists and retailers.
    - >-
      Uniform applications lead to over- or under-correction of pH and calcium
      issues, causing 2 to 8 percent yield loss and 10 to 25 percent overspend
      on amendments.
    - >-
      Prescriptions often fail in the cab due to incompatible file formats,
      missing equipment constraints, or rate smoothing issues across mixed
      fleets.
    - >-
      Lime quality (ECCE), gypsum purity, and haul distance costs are not
      systematically modeled, leading to poor ROI and payback uncertainty.
    - >-
      Soil test data frequently arrives as PDFs or CSVs with inconsistent column
      names and units, creating data-entry errors and delays.
    - >-
      Retailers and applicators need defensible, auditable recommendations and
      documentation for compliance and customer trust.
    - >-
      Existing tools do not close the loop using yield maps and as-applied data
      to learn and improve future prescriptions.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven ingestion maps any soil lab format including PDFs to a
      normalized schema with unit detection and QC checks.
    - >-
      Automated zone creation blends pH, buffer pH, CEC, OM, EC, elevation,
      historic yield, and soil texture to define stable management zones.
    - >-
      Recommendation engine targets crop-specific pH and calcium-sodium
      thresholds, uses buffer pH to compute lime need, adjusts for ECCE and
      depth, and triggers gypsum for sodic and structural issues.
    - >-
      Equipment-aware prescription generator sets min-max rates, rate steps,
      swath widths, turn compensation, and smoothing to avoid cab errors across
      John Deere, CNH, Trimble, Raven, and AgLeader.
    - >-
      ROI module quantifies cost per acre, expected yield response bands by crop
      and soil, 1 to 3 year payback, and scenario tests for alternative lime
      sources and gypsum products.
    - >-
      One-click exports produce ISO-XML, shapefile, and proprietary formats,
      plus a human-readable PDF summary with assumptions and audit trail.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning ingests as-applied and yield maps to recalibrate
      response curves and zone boundaries season over season.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any soil test into a zone-based, machine-ready lime and gypsum
    prescription with quantified ROI in under 10 minutes, compatible across
    mixed fleets and labs, and continuously improved by closed-loop learning
    from as-applied and yield data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset linking soil tests, zone prescriptions, as-applied logs,
    and yield outcomes across multiple labs and mixed fleets enables continuous
    learning and region-specific response curves that are difficult to
    replicate. Combined with robust multi-lab OCR normalization, equipment-aware
    exports, and audited ROI reporting, SoilRx AI becomes the default
    prescription engine for lime and gypsum within retailer and lab workflows.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Progressive growers, farm managers, and agronomy teams who want every ton of
    lime/gypsum to deliver measurable ROI at soil prep, planting, and
    cultivation.
  problem: >-
    - External: Field variability, uneven pH and Ca/Na balance, guesswork on
    zone rates, time-consuming Rx creation, file incompatibility.

    - Internal: Frustration and uncertainty about where amendment dollars go and
    whether theyâ€™ll pay back.

    - Philosophical: You shouldnâ€™t have to guessâ€”every amendment should be
    right-rate, right-place, right-time.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: Weâ€™ve lived the tight windows, mixed lab formats, and costly
    over/under-application.

    - Authority: AI trained on thousands of soil tests and outcomes,
    agronomist-reviewed. Proven zone modeling. Exports to ISOXML/Shape/CN1/JD
    Gen4/Trimble/AFS. Clear ROI analysis attached to every rec.
  plan: >-
    - 1) Upload: Soil tests (any lab) + field boundaries; select goals (pH
    target, Ca:Mg, sodic mitigation).

    - 2) Analyze: AI builds zones, optimizes lime/gypsum rates, and quantifies
    payback; agronomist QA.

    - 3) Execute: Download machine-ready prescriptions; apply at
    prep/plant/cultivate; season check-in and adjustments.

    - Agreement: Your data stays yours; simple pricing; full support through
    application.

    - Direct: Book a 20â€‘minute demo or start a 500â€‘acre pilot today.

    - Transitional: Upload recent soil tests for a free ROI preview and sample
    prescription.
  success: |-
    - Consistent pH and improved Ca balance across zones.
    - Lower overspend versus flat-rate, higher confidence per pass.
    - Faster Rx turnaround and seamless monitor loading.
    - Stronger emergence, more uniform stands, and steadier yield potential.
    - Audit-ready recommendations that document stewardship.
  failure: >-
    - Continued guesswork leading to wasted tons and patchy pH.

    - Locked-up nutrients, poor soil structure in sodic areas, and uneven
    stands.

    - Lost time creating/cleaning files and missed application windows.

    - No clear link between amendment spend and field ROI.
