  problem:
    - >-
      Material waste from suboptimal nesting and stacking leads to 3–8% lost
      yield on polyurethane/other flexible foam buns and slabs.
    - >-
      Manual planning (Excel/whiteboard) consumes 4–12 planner hours/day per
      plant and creates schedule volatility, late jobs, and inconsistent setups.
    - >-
      Cutting programs are often machine-/OEM-specific; post-processing and
      label/pick-list creation are error-prone, causing rework and scrap.
    - >-
      Difficulty consolidating small orders across like materials, densities,
      ILDs, and thicknesses leaves remnants underutilized and inflates
      inventory.
    - >-
      Scheduling rarely accounts for true machine constraints (kerf, blade type,
      contour vs. horizontal/vertical saw limits, stack height, changeovers),
      reducing throughput 5–15%.
    - >-
      Limited feedback loop from machine execution (run time, cut quality,
      breakage, scrap codes) to continuously improve nesting and estimates.
    - >-
      Multi-plant or multi-line capacity balancing is ad hoc, reducing
      on-time-in-full (OTIF) and increasing expedites.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven nesting across buns/slabs that respects thickness, density/ILD,
      grain/lay direction, kerf, and minimum web constraints.
    - >-
      Stacking optimizer to define layer counts and cut sequences, consolidating
      orders with compatible specs and due dates to minimize changeovers.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling that accounts for machine capabilities,
      tool/blade constraints, stack heights, setup sequences, and labor shifts.
    - >-
      Automatic generation of machine-ready cut files and labels/pick-lists
      (with barcodes/QR) for Bäumer, Fecken-Kirfel, Zünd, Eastman, Atom, and
      DXF/HPGL/ISO G-code formats.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture actual run times, scrap codes, and rework to
      refine estimates, nest strategies, and schedule rules.
    - >-
      Remnant management: catalog, recommend, and auto-assign remnants to future
      nests to boost reuse and reduce inventory.
    - >-
      ERP/MES connectors to sync orders, BOMs, materials, routings, and
      completion confirmations; write-back of actuals and lot traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase foam yield and throughput with an AI+OR optimizer that nests across
    buns/slabs and schedules machines, outputting OEM-specific, machine-ready
    programs and labeled pick-lists—delivering 2–7% material savings and 5–15%
    throughput gains within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimizer and scheduling engine calibrated to flexible
    foam physics and common OEMs, combined with a certified post-processor
    library and closed-loop learning from shop-floor data—creating a data moat
    and shorter time-to-value than generic nesting tools or in-house methods.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Flexible polyurethane foam fabricators and converters (buns-to-parts) in
      seating, bedding, packaging, filtration, and acoustics.
    - >-
      Manufacturers using CNC contour cutters, oscillating knife/tangential
      knife tables, waterjet (for specialty foams), horizontal/vertical saws,
      and slitters.
    - >-
      Mid-market plants (20–300 employees, 1–12 CNC assets) seeking OEE and
      yield gains; enterprise groups with 3–20 plants needing standardization.
    - >-
      Roles: operations/plant managers, production planners/schedulers, CNC
      programmers, quality managers, finance leaders/CFOs focused on material
      cost and throughput.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to foam fabricators and converters; ABM targeting NAICS
      326150 lists and adjacent SICs in seating, bedding, and packaging.

  character: >-
    Production managers, schedulers, and plant leaders at urethane and other
    foam product (except polystyrene) manufacturers (NAICS 326150) who must hit
    yield, on-time delivery, and utilization targets without firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual nesting across buns/slabs, machine constraints, and
    changeovers waste material and time; fragmented data leads to pick errors
    and rework. Internal: Frustration from margin erosion, overtime, and
    reliance on tribal knowledge and spreadsheets. Philosophical: Cutting foam
    shouldn’t waste good material or people’s time—every bun should deliver
    maximum value.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run and supported foam cutting operations, so we know the constraints,
    kerf/orientation rules, and delivery pressures you face. Our AI optimizer
    and scheduler is purpose-built for foam, integrates with your machines and
    ERP/MES, and has delivered measurable yield and schedule gains in production
    plants.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import orders/BOMs, bun/slab inventory, machine capabilities,
    kerf/orientation rules. 2) Optimize: Generate best-fit nests and a feasible
    schedule; review in the browser. 3) Execute: Auto-generate machine-ready
    programs and accurate pick-lists; track yield, scrap, and on-time KPIs.
    Assurance: Low-risk pilot, no disruption to current machines, secure and
    supported onboarding.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo to see your parts nested on your buns.
    Transitional: Send 2–4 weeks of orders for a free yield and schedule report
    with sample nests and pick-lists.
  success: >-
    Higher yield per bun/slab; fewer changeovers; accurate pick-lists and
    traceability; stable schedule and on-time delivery; less scrap and rework;
    reduced overtime; machine-ready programs that run right the first time;
    measurable margin and sustainability gains.
  failure: >-
    Continued scrap piles and material spend; missed ship dates and chargebacks;
    overtime and burnout; chaotic floor with pick errors and rework; dependence
    on tribal knowledge; margin erosion and lost bids.
