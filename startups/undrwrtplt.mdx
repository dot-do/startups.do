  problem:
    - >-
      Commercial underwriting for SME/mid-market loans is slow (average 3–8
      hours per memo; multi-day cycle times) and costly ($250–$800 per file) due
      to manual spreading, document handling, and memo drafting.
    - >-
      Inconsistent risk assessment and memo quality across analysts increases
      rework, exception rates, and credit committee friction.
    - >-
      Underwriter capacity is a bottleneck in growth markets; banks struggle to
      scale throughput without hiring, and onboarding new analysts takes 3–6
      months.
    - >-
      Banks must meet stringent model risk (SR 11-7), data lineage, and
      auditability requirements; generic AI tools lack explainability and
      controls.
    - >-
      Source documents are unstructured and varied (customer-prepared
      financials, tax returns, bank statements, PDFs, images), causing
      extraction errors and delays.
    - >-
      Legacy LOS/credit systems lack modern AI capabilities; point tools for OCR
      or LLMs don’t deliver end-to-end memo-ready outputs with policy
      compliance.
    - >-
      Credit leaders lack real-time visibility into pipeline risk, policy
      exceptions, and productivity to improve portfolio and staffing decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Document intake and extraction: automated collection via portal, email,
      SFTP, Box/SharePoint; high-accuracy OCR/table extraction tuned for tax
      returns, compiled/reviewed/audited financials, bank statements, AR/AP
      agings.
    - >-
      Automated spreading and ratio analysis: map to GAAP/SIC-specific
      templates; handle multi-entity consolidations; compute 60+ standard ratios
      plus bank-defined metrics; trend and variance analysis over 3–5 years.
    - >-
      Risk scoring with explainability: configurable models (statistical or
      rules-based) with factor-level contributions, sensitivity analysis, and
      policy rule engine (industry caps, leverage, DSCR, guarantor coverage).
    - >-
      Credit memo drafting: AI-generated memo in bank format (exec summary,
      business overview, financial analysis, collateral, covenants,
      risks/mitigants, recommendation) with citations linking each figure to
      source pages; redlining and version control.
    - >-
      Exception and policy management: auto-flag covenant breaches, missing
      docs, stale financials, policy exceptions; workflow queues and approvals
      aligned to dual control.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: in-app validation tasks, side-by-side source
      document viewer, one-click corrections that retrain private models via
      safe feedback loops.
    - >-
      Integrations: out-of-the-box connectors to nCino/Salesforce,
      Finastra/Abrigo, Temenos, FIS, Moody’s (RiskCalc/CreditLens),
      Equifax/Experian/D&B; export to loan docs and servicing platforms.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2 Type II, encryption in transit/at rest,
      SSO/SAML, RBAC, full audit logs, data residency options, VPC or on-prem;
      model inventory and documentation aligned to SR 11-7.
    - >-
      Deployment and change management: 8–12 week rollout (pilot->scale),
      training for analysts, KPI dashboarding, and MRM documentation package
      (model description, validation plan, monitoring).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce time-to-memo by 60–80% with audit-ready, explainable AI that extracts
    documents, spreads financials, scores risk, and drafts bank-specific credit
    memos—integrated to your LOS and compliant with SR 11-7. Typical payback <6
    months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Bank-grade, memo-specific AI tuned on proprietary annotated commercial
    lending corpora with policy-aware drafting and citation to source; prebuilt
    integrations to major LOS/data providers; and an SR 11-7-ready validation
    kit that generic LLM/OCR tools and LOS incumbents lack.
