  title: Slab Yield & Cut-Plan Optimizer
  description: >-
    Optimize piece nesting across slabs/remnants considering defects, vein
    direction, kerf, and machine limits.
  targetUsers:
    - Production managers
    - CNC/waterjet operators
    - Owners
  triggers:
    - Approved job with templated DXF ready
    - Low-yield alert
    - High-value materials require optimization
  inputs:

    - 'Machine constraints (kerf, min distances), label schema'
  steps:
    - Normalize and validate piece geometry; capture tolerances and seam rules
    - Detect/ingest slab defects and veins from images or operator annotations
    - Run constraint-based 2D nesting across slabs/remnants
    - 'Score nests by waste %, seam/vein continuity, changeovers'

  problem:
    - >-
      Material waste from suboptimal layouts (typical 8–20% waste) due to manual
      nesting and limited use of remnants.
    - >-
      Manual layout and vein-matching consume 30–90 minutes per job; variability
      by planner skill leads to inconsistent results.
    - >-
      Defects (fissures, pits, resin patches) not fully captured or respected in
      plans, causing re-cuts, delays, and scrap.
    - >-
      Machine constraints (bridge saw rotation limits, waterjet lead-in/out,
      kerf width, vacuum-cup placement, table size) often ignored in planning,
      causing on-machine rework and downtime.
    - >-
      Remnant inventories are poorly indexed and rarely re-used (often <10%
      re-use within 90 days) due to lack of searchable geometry/orientation/vein
      metadata.
    - >-
      Fragmented software stack (CAD/CAM, inventory, job management) requires
      duplicate data entry and increases error risk.
    - >-
      Difficulty quantifying true yield and planning efficiency; lack of
      feedback loop to continuously improve cut strategies.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer-vision mapping of each slab/remnant from photos or scans to
      detect defects, resin patches, and usable areas; automatic calibration for
      lens distortion and scale.
    - >-
      AI-driven nesting/packing that respects vein orientation,
      book-match/mirror constraints, grain continuity across seams, and minimum
      edge distances.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware cut sequencing that honors machine capabilities (kerf,
      blade diameter, rotation limits, max feed rates, vacuum cup keep-out
      zones, lead-in/out for jets) and minimizes repositioning and tool changes.
    - >-
      Remnant-aware planning: automatically suggests and prioritizes remnants by
      geometry, thickness, color/lot, vein angle, and required orientation;
      tracks remnant provenance.
    - >-
      Simulation and verification: visualize cut sequence, predicted run time,
      and safety checks; export CAM-ready files (DXF/DWG, G-code variants,
      XML/CSV toolpaths) or handoff to existing CAM (e.g., Alphacam Stone).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: compares planned vs. actual cuts and yield, learns
      from operator edits, and updates machine-specific profiles to improve over
      time.
    - >-
      Dashboards and ROI tracking: yield %, waste area, remnant reuse rates,
      planning time per job, on-time completion, and cost savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase stone yield 3–8% and cut planning productivity 2–3x by
    automatically nesting pieces across slabs and remnants—respecting defects,
    vein direction, kerf, and machine limits—integrated with your existing
    CAD/CAM and job systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization engine trained on real slab/remnant datasets
    with machine-validated constraint models, combined with OEM-certified
    post-processors and deep integrations—yielding measurable savings within 60
    days and difficult for general-purpose nesting vendors to replicate.
