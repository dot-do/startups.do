leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Flooring takeoffs are largely manual in PlanSwift/STACK/MeasureSquare,
      consuming 1–3 hours per typical single-family or multifamily unit and 4–10
      hours for light-commercial jobs, delaying bid turnaround and reducing win
      rate.
    - >-
      Human error in area/linear counts and waste factors leads to 2–5% material
      variance, causing margin erosion (often $200–$1,500/job) or short
      shipments and reorders.
    - >-
      Waste optimization for planks, tile, sheet goods, and stairs is complex
      (pattern/layout, roll width optimization, directionality, lot constraints)
      and typically isn’t automated or auditable.
    - >-
      Creating a detailed, SKU-level bill of materials with adhesives,
      underlayment, trims, transitions, and stair parts is manual and
      inconsistent across estimators, causing rework between estimating,
      purchasing, and installers.
    - >-
      Estimators struggle to scale capacity in peak bidding seasons; onboarding
      junior estimators takes 3–6 months to reach acceptable accuracy, creating
      a hiring bottleneck.
    - >-
      Limited integration between takeoff tools and ERP/estimating (RFMS,
      QFloors), purchasing systems, and supplier catalogs forces duplicate data
      entry and increases quote-to-order cycle time.
    - >-
      Verifying field conditions from photos/LiDAR is ad hoc; mismatches between
      plans and site reality drive change orders and disputes without a clear
      audit trail.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted plan takeoff from PDFs, photos, and mobile LiDAR that segments
      rooms, detects flooring boundaries, measures area/linear footage, and
      identifies stairs and transitions.
    - >-
      Flooring-optimized waste engine for planks, tile, and sheet goods (roll
      width/layout optimization, cut plans, pattern matching, grain/direction
      controls).
    - >-
      Rules-based BOM generator that maps assemblies to supplier SKUs
      (adhesives, underlayment, trims, treads/risers/nosing, transitions) with
      pricing pulled from partner catalogs or customer price lists.
    - >-
      Quality control workflow: confidence heatmaps, discrepancy flags vs. plan
      scales/notes, side-by-side manual adjustment, and full audit trail for
      sign-off.
    - >-
      Templates and multi-unit replication for multifamily and production
      builders; unit type libraries and change-order diffs for revisions.
    - >-
      One-click exports to RFMS/QFloors, CSV/XLSX, and proposal PDFs; API for
      ERPs and procurement.
    - >-
      Mobile field app to validate site conditions using iPhone/iPad LiDAR and
      photo capture; auto-compare field scans vs. plans.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, auditable flooring-specific AI takeoffs with +/-3% area accuracy
    and automated, SKU-mapped BOMs that cut bid time by 70%, reduce material
    variance by 2–4%, and integrate directly to RFMS/QFloors/supplier catalogs
    for quote-to-order in minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously growing dataset of flooring-specific annotated
    plans, site photos, and LiDAR scans combined with SKU-mapped BOM rules tied
    to major distributors. Feedback loops from integrated RFMS/QFloors workflows
    create defensible workflow depth, while waste-optimization IP and cut-plan
    simulation for sheet/plank goods deliver measurable margin impact that
    generic takeoff tools lack.

    and material counts to bid confidently and win profitable work.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual takeoffs are slow and error‑prone; messy plans and missing
    dimensions cause missed stairs/trim and costly change orders. Internal: Late
    nights chasing quantities create uncertainty and stress. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t have to gamble your margin because plan sets are inconsistent.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know bid days are chaotic and every quantity must be defensible.

    producing square footage, waste, stairs/trim counts, and a detailed bill of
    materials—with transparent assumptions and easy overrides.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload plans or site data (PDFs, photos, LiDAR). 2) AI identifies spaces
    and calculates SQFT, waste, stairs, and trim/transition counts. 3) Review
    and adjust assumptions, then export a detailed BOM to Excel or your
    estimating software.
