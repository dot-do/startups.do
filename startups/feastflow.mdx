  problem:
    - >-
      Independent and regional specialty food retailers lack time and expertise
      to build and optimize lifecycle email/SMS flows that drive repeat
      purchases and higher AOV.
    - >-
      Customer data is fragmented across POS, e-commerce, and loyalty systems,
      making segmentation and attribution difficult.
    - >-
      Perishable/seasonal inventory requires timely, localized messaging tied to
      stock, shelf-life, and holidays—most generic ESPs don’t support this.
    - >-
      Creative production (copy, images, offers) is a bottleneck; testing is
      sporadic and rarely data-driven.
    - >-
      Regulatory risk (TCPA/CTIA, 10DLC) and deliverability management are
      burdensome for small teams.
    - >-
      Measurement is unclear: owners can’t tie messaging to margin, repeat rate,
      and LTV.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations unify POS, e-commerce, and loyalty data;
      auto-builds five core flows in 48 hours (Welcome, Abandoned Cart, Browse
      Abandon, Post-Purchase/Replenish, Winback).
    - >-
      Food-retail–specific AI segmentation (RFM/CLV, dietary/affinity tags,
      perishable purchase cycles) with dynamic geofencing for local store
      events.
    - >-
      Inventory- and perishability-aware triggers (e.g., ‘72h-to-expiry
      markdown’, ‘back-in-stock by store’, ‘seasonal box launch’) and automatic
      safe-discount recommendations based on margin/COGS.
    - >-
      Auto-generated creative: on-brand copy, subject lines, SMS variants, UGC
      prompts, recipe/pairing suggestions; pulls live product imagery and
      pricing from catalog.
    - >-
      Continuous testing (multi-armed bandits) across offers, creative, timing,
      and channel, optimizing for profit per message and LTV, not just CTR.
    - >-
      Compliance autopilot: 10DLC registration, TCPA consent capture, quiet
      hours, opt-out handling, and carrier rules; deliverability monitoring and
      IP warming.
    - >-
      Attribution and ROI dashboard: revenue and gross margin from flows, repeat
      rate delta, AOV change, opt-in growth; benchmarks vs. similar stores in
      your category and region.
    - >-
      “Done-for-you” option: we set up, monitor, and iterate flows; monthly
      optimization sprints with clear targets and reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    The only AI lifecycle platform built for specialty food retail that
    auto-builds and continuously optimizes email/SMS flows tied to inventory,
    seasonality, and margins—boosting repeat purchase rate by 10–20% and AOV by
    5–8% in 90 days, with full compliance and minimal lift.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-trained models + inventory/perishability intelligence + localized
    seasonal playbooks, combined with deliverability/compliance ops and a
    growing performance benchmark dataset specific to specialty food retail.
    This reduces time-to-value to <2 weeks and drives reliable profit-weighted
    optimization competitors can’t replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Owners and marketers at independent specialty food retailers (cheese,
    butcher, gourmet, ethnic, natural) who want more repeat purchases and LTV
    without hiring a full-time team.
  problem: >-
    External: scattered data and manual blasts make tailored offers hard.

    generic discounts.

    local events. Our retail lifecycle experts and AI, trained on proven flows,
    integrate with your POS/ecommerce and SMS/email tools to deliver compliant,
    on-brand campaigns that respect your margins.

    auto-builds flows (welcome, post-purchase, replenishment, back-in-stock,
    VIP/loyalty, seasonal, win-back) with creative, offers, and tests tuned to
    margin and inventory. 3) Launch and auto-optimize; you approve and adjust in
    a simple dashboard. No code; quick start; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14-day pilot. Transitional: Get a free lifecycle audit and

  success: >-
    Your list becomes a reliable revenue channel: more repeat orders, higher AOV
    and LTV, fewer unnecessary discounts, sell-through on seasonal launches,
    subscribers who feel known, and steadier weekly revenue.
  failure: >-
    Keep batch-and-blasting, miss seasonal windows, over-discount, lose
    first-time buyers, waste ad spend, risk compliance issues, and leave money
    on the shelf.
