leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High false positives in fraud rules create investigator overload and
      customer abrasion; typical alert precision is often <10–20% in production.
    - >-
      Latency constraints at FNOL and during payments: many carriers need
      sub-200 ms decisions but current tools batch-score overnight, missing
      real-time interdiction.
    - >-
      Limited cross-claim/entity visibility: duplicate identities, organized
      rings, and staged losses evade single-claim models and siloed data.
    - >-
      Opaque black-box models make SIU adoption, regulator reviews, and internal
      model risk governance difficult.
    - >-
      Model drift from seasonality, catastrophe events, vendor data changes, and
      behavior adaptation reduces lift within months.
    - >-
      Integration complexity with core systems (Guidewire/Duck Creek) and legacy
      claim data slows time-to-value >6–12 months.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion: pre-built connectors for ClaimCenter/Duck Creek/S3/SQL;
      stream FNOL, supplements, provider bills, and payment requests.
    - >-
      Feature factory: engineered claim, policy, and party features (temporal,
      geospatial, severity, provider/attorney patterns) refreshed in near
      real-time.
    - >-
      Digital risk layer: device fingerprinting and IP intelligence to identify
      multi-account devices, proxy/VPN/Tor use, and impossible travel.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and graphing: probabilistic identity resolution on
      names, phones, addresses, devices, providers; build a dynamic claims
      graph.
    - >-
      Model ensemble: gradient-boosted trees for tabular fraud, graph
      algorithms/GNNs for network risk, and unsupervised anomaly detectors for
      novel patterns.
    - >-
      Calibrated composite score: single 0–1 risk score with reason codes and
      contributing signals, optimized for precision@k and alert volumes.
    - >-
      LLM-generated SIU summaries: structured, evidence-based rationales that
      cite specific data fields and reason codes; no free-form speculation.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: triage queues, auto-hold/payment interdiction, and
      case creation via APIs; two-way SIU feedback labels.
    - >-
      Governance: documentation packs (model cards, data lineage, validation
      results), challenger models, A/B tests, and drift dashboards.
    - >-
      Privacy-preserving collaboration: optional cross-carrier consortium via
      hashed identifiers/clean rooms to detect multi-carrier rings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time and batch fraud/anomaly scoring that merges claim features,
    network relationships, and device/IP signals into an auditable risk score
    with concise, regulator-ready explanations—cutting false positives 20–40%,
    boosting SIU hit rates 2–3x, and reducing claim leakage within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A privacy-preserving cross-carrier claims graph and device intelligence
    layer that detects organized fraud rings in real time, paired with
    regulator-ready, evidence-citing explanations and pre-built Guidewire/Duck
    Creek connectors to deliver measurable ROI in under 90 days.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Claims and SIU leaders at direct property & casualty carriers (NAICS 524126)
    who must detect fraud fast without delaying honest policyholders.
  problem: >-
    Adaptive fraud hides across claim, network, and device/IP signals; manual
    rules and siloed tools miss patterns, flood SIU with false positives, slow
    cycle time, and create leakage and regulatory risk.
  guide: >-
    Fraud/Anomaly Screening for Claims pairs carrier-grade ML, graph
    relationships, and device/IP intelligence with reasoned LLM explanations
    your SIU can trust. We speak claims, integrate with core systems and FNOL,
    and deliver transparent, auditable scores in real time or batch.
  plan: >-
    1) Proof-of-value: backtest on historical claims to calibrate thresholds and
    reason codes. 2) Integrate: connect APIs/batch, map queues, and embed
    explanations in your SIU/claims UI. 3) Operate: deploy to production with
    monitoring, SIU feedback loops, and periodic retraining.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo or request a 4–6 week proof-of-value.
  success: >-
    High-precision triage in seconds; higher SIU hit rates; fewer false
    positives; reduced loss and LAE; faster, fairer payouts; auditable
    explanations that build trust; continuous learning that adapts to new fraud
    rings.
  failure: >-
    Without action, organized fraud persists, loss ratios rise, honest customers
    wait longer, SIU chases low-yield referrals, and opaque models erode trust
    with regulators and executives.

  problem:
    - >-
      Fraud leakage inflates loss and expenses while manual review can’t keep
      pace.
    - Rules-only systems miss subtle patterns and create alert fatigue.
    - 'Siloed policy, claims, provider, and device data leave blind spots.'
    - 'Slow, inconsistent SIU referrals reduce recovery and deterrence.'
    - >-
      Limited transparency makes it hard to justify actions to regulators and
      customers.
    - Integrations are heavy; ROI is hard to prove and monitor.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified fraud risk scores at FNOL and throughout the claim
      lifecycle—real-time or batch.
    - >-
      Graph analytics links people, providers, vehicles, addresses, devices, and
      IPs to expose collusion.
    - 'Device/IP intelligence flags spoofing, velocity, and location anomalies.'

      Device/IP analytics: fingerprinting, proxy/VPN/Tor detection, geo
      anomalies, and velocity checks.
    - >-
      Explainability: reason codes plus short LLM narratives tied to facts and
      policy rules.
    - >-
      Configurable thresholds and queues for adjusters, SIU, and automated
      actions.
    - >-
      Case linkage and deduplication to unify related claims across lines and
