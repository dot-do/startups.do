  problem:
    - >-
      30–50% of inbound inquiries arrive after-hours or when phones are busy;
      many go unanswered or receive slow responses, depressing conversion and
      utilization.
    - >-
      CSRs spend 3–6 minutes per call looking up availability, pricing,
      delivery, and terms across multiple systems, limiting throughput and
      causing long hold times.
    - >-
      Quoting accuracy and consistency vary by agent, leading to price leakage,
      missed add-ons (attachments, fuel, damage waiver), and disputes.
    - >-
      Web forms and email inquiries require manual follow-up (often next day),
      causing lead decay and lost bookings to faster competitors.
    - >-
      Managing COI/ID verification, deposits, and delivery scheduling adds
      friction that delays quote-to-order conversion.
    - >-
      Lack of real-time analytics on quote volume, conversion, and after-hours
      demand hides true revenue opportunities and staffing needs.
    - >-
      Multi-location dealers struggle to route inquiries and inventory
      intelligently across branches, resulting in low fleet utilization.
    - >-
      High labor costs and turnover make it difficult to staff phones/chats to
      meet peak demand consistently.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel AI that understands rental intents via phone, SMS, web chat,
      and email, and gathers job details (dates, site, delivery, attachments,
      ID).
    - >-
      Real-time inventory and pricing lookups via connectors to leading rental
      ERPs; multi-branch routing for cross-location availability.
    - >-
      Automated quote assembly with taxes, fees, delivery, damage waiver, COI/ID
      requirements, and ready-to-sign e-sign link.
    - >-
      Embedded payment links for deposits or full prepay; optional stored card
      on file; refundable holds where policy allows.
    - >-
      Smart upsells for attachments, fuel, consumables, and protection based on
      job context and utilization rules.
    - >-
      Delivery window proposals and dispatch integration to reduce
      back-and-forth with ops.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflows for edge cases, approvals, or complex fleet
      items; seamless handoff to CSR when needed.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard for quote volume, response times, conversion,
      after-hours capture, top SKUs, missed-demand alerts, and agent deflection
      rate.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Answer every inquiry in seconds across phone, SMS, web chat, and email;
    confirm real-time availability; price accurately; and deliver a
    ready-to-sign, pay-enabled quote—fully integrated with your rental ERP—so
