leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Operators rely on static, one-size-fits-all prices across routes and
      locations, leaving margin on the table.
    - >-
      Manual price updates are slow and error-prone; remote price change tools
      exist but lack guidance on what prices to set.
    - >-
      Little visibility into true demand elasticity by SKU/location/time,
      leading to fear of raising prices and potential volume loss.
    - >-
      Rising product costs (CSDs, snacks) compress margins; operators struggle
      to pass through increases optimally.
    - >-
      Limited A/B testing capability; promotions and price tests are anecdotal
      rather than statistically valid.
    - >-
      Contractual/venue constraints (schools, hospitals, government) require
      guardrails and clear audit trails for price changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from VMS/telematics (transactions, planograms, inventory,
      price files) and external signals (foot traffic, weather, events).
    - >-
      Elasticity modeling per SKU x machine x time-of-day/day-of-week with
      cold-start heuristics for low-volume SKUs.
    - >-
      Policy/guardrail engine honoring venue contracts, price floors/ceilings,
      max change per period, and regulatory display rules.
    - >-
      Continuous experimentation (multi-armed bandits/A-B) to converge to
      optimal prices while minimizing revenue risk.
    - >-
      Remote price deployment to devices/readers; rollback and phased rollouts
      with canary groups.
    - >-
      Real-time monitoring of unit velocity, conversion, stockouts, and shopper
      sentiment proxies (cancels, timeouts).
    - >-
      Operator cockpit with “expected impact” forecasts, price recommendations,
      and one-click approvals.
    - >-
      Reporting: uplift vs control, confidence intervals, ROI by
      route/venue/SKU; audit logs for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase gross profit per machine by 5–12% in 60–90 days via AI-driven,
    guardrailed dynamic pricing that learns by location and time, integrates
    with your existing VMS/cashless stack, and runs continuous, compliant A/B
    tests without hurting vend volume.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, vending-specific elasticity and experimentation models trained
    on millions of machine-level transactions, embedded within operator/VMS
    workflows via deep partnerships with cashless and VMS providers; robust
    guardrails for venue and regulatory compliance reduce operator risk and
    switching likelihood.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-to-large vending machine operators (100–10,000+ machines) using

      transit hubs, and public venues.
    - >-

      (channel partners).
    - >-
      Machine OEMs and retrofit hardware providers looking to differentiate with
      AI-enabled pricing (channel partners).
  channels:
    - >-
      Co-sell/embedded integrations with cashless/telematics providers
      (Cantaloupe, Nayax, PayRange) and VMS platforms (Parlevel, VendSys,
      Vagabond).
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    A vending machine operator who wants each machine to earn more with fair,
    location- and time-aware pricing—without constant manual tweaks.
  problem: >-
    External: Demand and willingness to pay vary by venue and daypart, while
    costs and competitors change fast—yet prices stay static. Internal:
    Spreadsheets and guesswork risk over/under-pricing, chargebacks, and unhappy
    customers. Philosophical: Pricing shouldn’t be a gamble—operators deserve
    data-backed, transparent pricing control.
  guide: >-
    Dynamic Price Optimization is an AI pricing co‑pilot built for vending
    operators (NAICS 445132). We understand routes, planograms, commissions, and
    cashless fees, offering clear recommendations, guardrails, and A/B testing
    so you stay in control with evidence, not hunches.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your VMS/telemetry and pricebook. 2) Set rules and guardrails
    (min/max, venue tiers, taxes/commissions). 3) Launch tests by location/time
    and approve optimizations with ongoing reporting.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot on a subset of machines—or request a pricing opportunity
    report.
  success: >-
    Right prices by machine, product, and daypart; stronger profit per route
    while protecting volume; fewer manual price changes; auditable, compliant
    pricing; happier customers and host locations.
  failure: >-
    Flat pricing leaves money on the table, triggers volume swings and
    complaints, burns hours in spreadsheets, and creates inconsistent
    commissions and tax errors.
