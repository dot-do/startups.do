leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or infrequent checks of feed bins lead to unexpected feed-outs; in
      many complexes 2–5% of houses experience at least one runout per flock,
      causing stress, lost gain, higher mortality, and emergency deliveries.
    - >-
      Mill dispatchers lack real-time, complex-wide visibility of bin inventory
      and burn rates, limiting optimized batching and truck routing.
    - >-
      Consumption varies by age, genetics (Ross/Cobb), diet phase, temperature,
      and health; static thresholds or simple averages miss turning points and
      cause false alarms or late orders.
    - >-
      Communication gaps (texts/phone calls) between growers and mills create
      last-minute orders, stockouts, and overtime costs.
    - >-
      Existing sensors can be unreliable in dusty, humid environments
      (condensation, caking/bridging, calibration drift), eroding trust and
      adoption.
    - >-
      Oversupplying feed to avoid stockouts increases inventory carrying costs,
      stales feed, and can degrade feed quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Retrofit bin sensing kits (external ultrasonic or leg-mounted load cells)
      networked via LoRaWAN to a cellular/LTE-M gateway; installable without
      entering houses to meet biosecurity protocols.
    - >-
      Per-house machine learning models that learn burn curves by age, genetics,
      diet phase, and weather; runout-time forecasts with ≤6-hour MAE at a
      48-hour horizon (target).
    - >-
      Reorder point optimization that accounts for mill batching, lead times,
      delivery windows, and truck availability to compute house-specific reorder
      triggers.
    - >-
      Two-way integrations to mill ERP/TMS (e.g., MTech Systems, custom ERPs) to
      auto-generate orders and update delivery statuses.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection for bridging, stuck augers, and leaks using consumption
      variance and vibration patterns; automated calibration checks and alerts.
    - >-
      Operations dashboards for integrators/mills showing complex-level
      inventory, days of cover, prioritized delivery queues, and suggested
      routes.
    - >-
      Offline-first edge logic so local alerts and data buffering continue
      through cellular outages; automatic backfill on reconnect.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that turns bin data into timely, auto-triggered feed orders. Predicts
    runouts days ahead and aligns with mill lead times to cut feed-outs by up to
    80%, reduce emergency deliveries by ~30%, and save $1,000–$2,500 per house
    per year—all without entering the house.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    End-to-end poultry-specific stack: robust, biosecure hardware + per-house AI
    forecasting + mill ERP/TMS integrations that automatically convert
    predictions into timely orders and routes. The consumption dataset improves
    each flock, compounding accuracy and operational value over generic tank
    solutions.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Broiler growers, farm managers, and integrator feed schedulers (NAICS
    112320) who want zero feed-outs, predictable ordering, and lower delivery
    costs.
  problem: >-
    External: Silo levels are unclear; burn rates swing with age, weather, and
    flock; late orders cause emergency runs. Internal: Constant worry about
    runouts and weekend disruptions. Philosophical: Feeding birds shouldn’t rely
    on guesswork when data can decide.
  guide: >-
    We understand one empty bin can derail a flock and your day. Our AI tracks
    bin levels and feed burn, learns per-house patterns, forecasts runout to the
    hour, and triggers timely orders. Works with common sensors or quick manual
    inputs; secure and biosecurity-aware.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect sensors or start with simple readings/photos. 2) The
    system learns burn curves per house and updates forecasts continuously. 3)
    Receive reorder alerts and auto-generate mill orders under your rules.
    Agreements: No hardware lock-in; your data stays yours; start with a 60-day
    pilot on one farm.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo; start a pilot; enable critical-bin alerts
    today. Transitional: Download the runout-risk checklist; get an ROI estimate
    from your last flock.
  success: >-
    Always-on visibility by bin/house/farm with runout date and time. Fewer
    emergency deliveries and lower freight. Protected growth curves, better
    uniformity and FCR. Smoother mill scheduling and fuller truckloads.
    Confident, proactive teams.
  failure: >-
    Feed-outs, bird stress, lost weight gain, and mortality. Penalties, overtime
    freight, and chaotic routes. Hours wasted chasing levels and calling mills.
    Damaged trust between growers and integrators.
