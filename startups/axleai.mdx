leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers juggle many simultaneous requests across mixed-capability
      fleets (light/medium/heavy duty, flatbed/wrecker) and struggle to assign
      the optimal truck/driver quickly, causing longer ETAs and missed SLAs.
    - >-
      High variability in demand by hour and geography leads to deadhead miles,
      idle time, and uneven driver workloads.
    - >-
      Motor-club and municipal SLAs (time-to-accept, on-scene time, priority
      codes) are complex and differ by partner; manual compliance tracking is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Existing dispatch software provides rules and manual assignment but lacks
      towing-specific predictive ETA, SLA risk scoring, and dynamic rebalancing
      under traffic/weather constraints.
    - >-
      Owner-operators and small fleets often lack telematics and standardized
      data flows, making real-time decisioning difficult without tight
      integrations.
    - >-
      Missed or late jobs damage relationships with motor clubs/insurers,
      lowering allocation share and revenue over time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time AI assignment engine that scores all available trucks/drivers
      against job constraints (capability, location, traffic, weather,
      equipment, driver certifications) and auto-dispatches or recommends best
      options.
    - >-
      Predictive ETA and SLA risk scoring trained on towing-specific historical
      outcomes (hook time, load type, terrain, time-of-day), enabling proactive
      reassignments.
    - >-
      Dynamic load balancing and repositioning guidance to reduce deadhead miles
      and prepare for predicted hotspots; includes fairness rules for police
      rotation.
    - >-
      Unified intake from multiple channels (phone, motor-club portals, web,
      SMS, API) with automated triage and priority handling based on SLAs and
      promised ETAs.
    - >-
      Exception handling: auto-escalation for at-risk jobs, backup provider
      suggestions, and customer/club notifications to reduce cancellations and
      penalties.
    - >-
      Compliance & analytics suite: live SLA dashboards, postmortem reports by
      partner, driver, truck, and zone; evidence for disputes and allocation
      share improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered towing dispatch that auto-assigns the best truck/driver in
    seconds, improves on-time arrival by 15–30%, reduces deadhead miles by
    10–20%, and boosts jobs-per-truck by 0.5–1.5/day—while meeting motor-club
    and municipal SLAs with auditable compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Towing-specialized optimization and ETA models trained on real-world tow
    outcomes with partner-specific SLA feedback loops, combined with deep
    integrations into leading tow dispatch and telematics platforms. Accruing
    data network effects (local traffic patterns, hook/load durations by vehicle
    type and scenario) improve accuracy and automation over generic
    field-service tools.
