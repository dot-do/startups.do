  problem:
    - >-
      Operators face alarm floods during oscillatory/abnormal grid events;
      correlated PMU channels trigger hundreds of duplicative alerts in seconds,
      slowing response and increasing risk of wrong actions.
    - >-
      Forced oscillations and weakly damped inter-area modes are hard to detect
      quickly with legacy thresholding; manual triage can take 10–30 minutes,
      missing early mitigation windows.
    - >-
      Existing WAMS tools produce many alerts but little
      prioritization/root-cause context; operators lack incident-centric views
      aligned to EMS workflows.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous PMU/PDC environments (IEEE C37.118, 61850, proprietary)
      impede unified analytics and model deployment across fleets.
    - >-
      Utilities must improve event detection/reporting for reliability audits
      while operating under NERC CIP constraints; adding analytics must not
      increase cyber risk or burden.
    - >-
      False positives erode trust, leading operators to disable alarms; false
      negatives risk oscillatory instability and equipment damage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time streaming analytics ingesting PMU data (IEEE C37.118.2) from
      PDCs; sub-second detection of inter-area/local oscillations, poorly damped
      modes, and forced oscillations using hybrid modal, coherence, and ML
      methods.
    - >-
      Alarm rationalization pipeline that clusters duplicative/correlated PMU
      alerts across time/space/channels into a single incident with severity,
      geographic footprint, mode shape, and likely drivers.
    - >-
      Topology-aware context by fusing CIM model (IEC 61970/61968) and EMS
      topology; maps incidents to substations/lines/generators and suggests
      playbook actions.
    - >-
      Operator-first HMI and APIs: incident timeline, mode frequency/damping
      estimates, coherence heatmaps, event replay, and one-click export to
      EMS/ITSM (e.g., ServiceNow) and historian/PI AF.
    - >-
      Deployment options: NERC-CIP-ready on-prem or private cloud within utility
      tenancy; high-availability, offline buffering, RBAC, syslog/SIEM
      integration.
    - >-
      Post-event analytics and reporting to support internal reviews and
      reliability audits (disturbance/event catalogs, response times,
      oscillation characteristics).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From torrents of PMU data to a few prioritized, actionable incidents in
    seconds. SynchroSentry detects oscillations/forced modes and clusters
    correlated alarms into incident-centric tickets with root-cause
    hints—reducing alarm volume 60–85%, cutting triage time 50–70%, and
    integrating cleanly with EMS workflows and NERC-CIP environments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Incident-centric alarm rationalization purpose-built for PMU data (not
    generic anomaly detection), trained on a proprietary, curated corpus of
    labeled oscillation/forced-mode events and validated with EPRI-style test
    sets—combined with proven sub-second latency on production PDC feeds and
    drop-in integrations with major EMS/PDC stacks under NERC-CIP constraints.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transmission and control room operators and reliability coordinators who
    want real-time, actionable visibility into grid oscillations and anomalies
    without alarm overload.
  problem: >-
    Forced modes and abnormal events hide in noisy PMU streams; alarm floods
    mask root cause, slow response, and increase risk of instability and
    non-compliance across the bulk power system.
  guide: >-
    We pair proven PMU/WAMS analytics with operator-centered AI. Our team has
    deep grid experience and integrates securely with your PDC/EMS to
    rationalize alarms and surface what matters.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect to your PMU/PDC feed (read-only). 2) Run a 30-day pilot to
    baseline behavior, tune thresholds, and cluster alarms by root cause. 3) Go
    live with operator workflows, APIs, and continuous model governance.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a live demo and start a pilot with your PMU feed; or request the
    technical brief and sample event report.
  success: >-
    Sub-second detection of oscillations and forced modes; fewer, clearer alarms
    clustered into actionable events; faster operator response; reduced outage
    risk; audit-ready event logs and insights.
  failure: >-
    Without this, operators drown in alarms, miss early oscillation signatures,
    and minor disturbances escalate to equipment trips, load shed, and
    regulatory scrutiny.
