    Monitor nearby pump prices and recommend compliant price changes to balance
    volume and margin.
  targetUsers:
    - Owners
    - District managers
    - Fuel buyers
  triggers:
    - Daily before opening

  risks:
    - Scraping/API ToS and legal compliance
    - Brand/franchise pricing constraints
    - >-
      Regulatory/anti-trust considerations (only public data, unilateral
      decisions)
  dependencies:
    - Client rack price/cost data
    - API keys for data sources
    - Defined margin/brand rules
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fuel retailers face volatile wholesale costs and highly visible street
      prices; manual pricing lags competitors by hours, sacrificing either
      volume or margin.
    - >-
      Local competitor price changes are fragmented across sources (signage,
      apps, POS, fleet networks); operators lack a single, trusted, timely view
      within a 0.5–2 mile trade area.
    - >-
      Most stations price for fuel margin in isolation; they do not quantify how
      price moves affect convenience-store footfall, basket size, and total
      gross profit dollars.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: below-cost laws in certain states, dual cash/credit
      pricing rules, price-gouging statutes during emergencies, and brand
      standards create complex guardrails that frontline staff struggle to
      follow.
    - >-
      Updating prices across dispensers, POS, and digital/road signage is
      error-prone and slow (15–60 minutes/site), creating mismatches that
      trigger fines or customer complaints.
    - >-
      Corporate teams lack measurable A/B testing and attribution to prove ROI
      from pricing strategies and justify capital/software spend.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified competitor price graph: continuously ingest public and partner
      data (signage OCR, crowdsourced apps, OPIS rack/spot, fleet networks) to
      estimate live competitor prices within a configurable radius (0.5–5
      miles).
    - >-
      Elasticity-driven recommendations: predict demand and margin at multiple
      candidate prices using factors like daypart, weather, traffic, local
      events, wholesale cost, brand, and payment mix.
    - >-
      C-store impact modeling: estimate footfall and basket changes tied to fuel
      price moves; optimize for total site gross profit dollars, not cpg alone.
    - >-
      Compliance-first rules engine: encode state-specific below-cost laws, dual
      pricing logic, brand guidelines, and emergency pricing restrictions; block
      non-compliant moves and auto-generate documentation.
    - >-
      One-click or autopilot execution: publish approved prices to POS/pump
      controllers and electronic signs; verify synchronization, and alert on
      mismatches.
    - >-
      A/B testing and ROI reporting: controlled experiments and uplifts vs.
      baselines on volume, cpg, gross profit dollars, and C-store KPIs;
      exportable for finance review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase total site gross profit dollars by 3–7% within 90 days via
    compliant, AI-driven price recommendations that adapt hourly, quantify
    C-store impact, and push approved prices to pumps/signage in under 2 minutes
    with full auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compliance-first optimization that maximizes total site gross profit (fuel +
    C-store) rather than cpg alone, powered by a multi-source competitor graph
    and prebuilt connectors to the dominant POS/controllers/signs. Early
    exclusive data-sharing agreements with select jobbers and signage OEMs
    improve local coverage and latency beyond publicly available sources.
  customerSegments:

      Jobbers/marketers who manage pricing for branded dealers (Shell, BP,
      Chevron, etc.) and need tools to support multiple BAs.

      engines and data lakes for decision support and governance.
    - >-

      price-sign vendors seeking added value for their installed base.
  channels:
