  problem:
    - >-
      High variability in raw juice (Brix, temperature, turbidity, non-sugars)
      causes frequent manual re-tuning of lime milk and CO2 dosing, leading to
      over-liming and pH overshoot.
    - >-
      Excess lime use (typical baseline 8–12 kg CaO per ton beet) increases
      filter cake load, kiln/fuel consumption, and disposal costs.
    - >-
      CO2 utilization is often 60–80%, with unreacted CO2 vented; poor
      gas–liquid contact and suboptimal pH endpoints waste gas and energy.
    - >-
      Filter blinding and short cycles (45–90 minutes) reduce availability and
      throughput; high DP leads to unplanned stops and operator interventions.
    - >-
      Deviation from target pH/alkalinity at 1st and 2nd carbonation increases
      color, ash, and sucrose losses to cake and molasses.
    - >-
      Manual control and operator heuristics struggle during load changes,
      start-ups, and beet quality shifts; slow response increases off-spec time.
    - >-
      Limited real-time visibility of key variables (alkalinity,
      carbonate/bicarbonate speciation, effective CaO strength) prevents
      proactive control.
    - >-
      Plants lack a standardized M&V method to quantify true savings from dosing
      adjustments across campaigns, hindering continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an AI advisor that ingests live plant data (flows, Brix,
      temperature, pH, alkalinity, turbidity, CaO content, CO2 flow/composition,
      filter DP) and outputs optimal lime milk and CO2 dosing setpoints.
    - >-
      Use soft sensors to estimate hard-to-measure variables (effective CaO
      strength, carbonate/bicarbonate ratio, saturation index, calcium
      carryover) at 1–5 second cadence.
    - >-
      Predictive optimization (constrained MPC) with feedforward from upstream
      disturbances recommends adjustments to minimize kg CaO/t beet and CO2
      losses while meeting pH, purity, clarity, and DP constraints.
    - >-
      Upset detection and root-cause analytics for filter blinding, gas
      distribution issues, saccharate quality drift, and gas purity deviations.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot HMI: clear setpoint recommendations, confidence scores,
      and what-if simulations for load or raw juice changes.
    - >-
      Campaign reporting and M&V module quantifying verified savings versus
      baselines with statistical confidence, ready for management and
      sustainability audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  character: >-
    Beet sugar production managers, process engineers, and carbonation operators
    who need to hit target juice pH and purity at the lowest reagent cost and
    filter load.
  problem: >-
    External: Variable beet quality and lagging lab feedback drive conservative
    over-dosing of lime milk and CO2, inflating cost and filter cake. Internal:
    Teams are stuck firefighting swings in alkalinity, turbidity, and pH without
    clear, real-time setpoints. Philosophical: Making quality sugar should not
    require wasting reagents, capacity, or energy.
  guide: >-
    We understand the volatility of liming/carbonation across a campaign and the
    pressure to keep presses running. Our AI blends first-principles chemistry
    with machine learning on your plant data to recommend optimal lime and CO2
    dosing—secure, explainable, and DCS-ready—so you cut lime and filter load
    while holding tighter purity and pH.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: 30-minute process review and data connection (flows, pH, purity,
    alkalinity, temperature). 2) Calibrate: Train and validate advisor on your
    historian; align constraints and setpoints. 3) Optimize: Run a 4–6 week
    pilot with live recommendations; then enable closed-loop or operator
    advisory and scale site-wide.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a process assessment and start a pilot on one line.
    Transitional: Request an ROI estimate and see sample advisory screens.
  success: >-
    - Lower lime usage and CO2 per ton of beet. - Reduced filter cake and press
    load; more throughput. - Tighter pH and purity control with fewer
    excursions. - Less steam and energy, fewer cloth changes, more uptime. -
    Documented cost savings and sustainability gains across the campaign.
  failure: >-
    Continue over-dosing lime, building excess filter cake, bottlenecking
    presses, riding pH excursions, wasting CO2 and energy, increasing
    maintenance costs, and missing campaign targets and margin potential.

  problem:
    - Excess lime consumption drives kiln fuel and mud handling costs.
    - 'Unstable pH and purity due to variable beets, temperature, and alkalinity.'
    - High filter cake load reduces throughput and traps sugar in mud.

    - Lab delays force reactive corrections instead of prevention.
    - 'CO2 use not synchronized with lime, wasting gas and capacity.'
    - Savings and setpoint discipline are hard to prove across shifts.
    - Higher waste and effluent load risk compliance and downtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time AI computes optimal lime milk and CO2 dosing to meet purity/pH
      at minimum reagent use.
