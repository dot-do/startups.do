  problem:
    - >-
      Under/over-bake events lead to scrap, rework, and brand risk; current
      threshold alarms miss multivariate drifts across oven zones, press force,
      and line speed.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from press jams, burner faults, or conveyor issues is
      detected late; maintenance is reactive and relies on operator feel.
    - >-
      Existing SCADA alarms are threshold-based and noisy; they don’t learn
      seasonal/shift/recipe patterns or provide early warnings and root-cause
      hints.
    - >-
      Quality variation across shifts and ambient conditions
      (humidity/temperature) isn’t systematically corrected; operators lack
      actionable setpoint guidance.
    - >-
      Data exists in PLCs/SCADA but is underused; plants want measurable ROI
      without heavy data-science staffing or complex IT projects.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge AI appliance connects to PLC/SCADA (OPC UA/EtherNet/IP/Modbus) to
      ingest oven zone temps, press force/pressure, line and conveyor speeds,
      burner states, exhaust flow, and optional color/moisture sensors.
    - >-
      Unsupervised/semi-supervised multivariate time-series models learn normal
      behavior by product/recipe and shift; detect drifts, interactions (e.g.,
      Zone 3 temp x press force) and early signs of jam or burner instability.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts with recommended adjustments (e.g., reduce line speed by
      3%, raise Zone 2 by 5°C) and confidence; integrates with
      Ignition/FactoryTalk and mobile/SMS/email.
    - >-
      Root-cause and after-action reports quantifying impact: scrap avoided,
      minutes of downtime prevented, energy deltas; weekly “Top 5 issues” and
      Model Health report.
    - >-
      Operator-centric HMI tiles and SOP checklists embedded in SCADA; silent
      mode for first 2–4 weeks to learn and reduce false positives.
    - >-
      Enterprise dashboard to benchmark lines/plants, track KPIs (FPY, OEE,
      energy/ton), manage recipes, and propagate best-practice setpoints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prevent under/over-bake and reduce downtime with an edge AI that learns your
    oven/press behavior, detects multivariate anomalies minutes earlier than
    threshold alarms, and recommends setpoint and speed adjustments—delivering
    6–12x annual ROI per line with fast, low-risk deployment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and templates for tortilla ovens/presses built from
    cross-plant datasets and OEM collaborations, enabling faster time-to-value
    and lower false alarms than generic analytics platforms; embedded operator
    guidance tied to SOPs rather than raw alerts.
