    - Production managers
    - Process engineers
  triggers:
    - New order book or daily schedule

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets/tribal knowledge, causing unstable
      schedules, frequent resequencing, and 2–6 hours/day of manual effort.
    - >-
      High changeover load (die set swaps, lube/coating changes, grade/diameter
      families) consumes 10–25% of line time due to nonoptimal sequencing.
    - >-
      Wire breaks and premature die wear create unplanned downtime and scrap;
      typical plants see 1–3 breaks per 100 tons, each costing 30–90 minutes
      plus $300–$1,000 in scrap/rework.
    - >-
      Energy is a major variable cost (approx. 250–450 kWh/ton). Poor draft/pass
      choices and speed settings waste 5–10% energy and trigger peak-demand
      charges.
    - >-
      Due-date adherence is volatile (OTD often 85–92%), with hot orders
      disrupting sequences and compounding changeovers.
    - >-
      Die inventory is underutilized; lack of die history tracking leads to
      misfit die sets, shortened die life, and unnecessary polishing or
      purchases.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest live order book (ERP) with due dates/priority, material (grade,
      cast/helix, diameter), coating/lubrication requirements, and routings.
    - >-
      Build asset/die inventory model: lines, capstans, annealers/patenting,
      speed/power limits, die library with size/taper/condition and die history.
    - >-
      Optimization engine: MILP + domain heuristics to co-optimize line
      assignment, sequence, pass reductions, die-set reuse, and changeover
      grouping; objective: weighted tardiness + setup time + expected break risk
      + energy cost.
    - >-
      Energy-aware scheduling: model kW vs. draft/speed/lube temp; respect
      TOU/peak windows; propose speed and pass schedules minimizing kWh/ton and
      peak demand.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: planners compare what-if options (rush orders, outages,
      material delays) with scorecards (OTD, changeover minutes, kWh/ton, breaks
      risk).
    - >-
      Shop-floor execution: publish frozen horizons to line terminals; barcode
      die sets; capture actuals (start/stop, breaks, die changes) for continuous
      learning.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: update die wear/break risk models and changeover
      times per line/grade; improve next schedules automatically.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase on-time delivery to ≥97% while cutting changeovers 15–30%, wire
    breaks 20–40%, and energy per ton 5–10% via a wire-drawing–specific
    optimizer that co-optimizes line sequencing, pass drafts, and die sets in
    minutes and re-optimizes in real time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained optimizer and die-life/break-risk models built from real
    die histories, pass schedules, and line constraints unique to steel wire
    drawing—plus prebuilt connectors and a validated ROI playbook that generic
    APS tools and spreadsheets lack.

    Connect ERP/MES orders, routings, machine limits, and die inventory; set
    objectives (due dates, changeovers, breaks, energy); run scenarios, review
    recommendations, and publish the daily/weekly schedule with pass drafts and
    die sets.
  callToAction: Schedule a demo or start a focused 4‑week pilot on one product family.
  success: >-
    Stable sequences, on‑time delivery, fewer changeovers and breaks, lower
    energy per ton, longer die life, and clear, confident plans everyone trust.
  failure: >-
