  title: Drawing-to-Quote Estimator (Countertops/Stone Panels)
  description: >-
    AI parses architectural drawings/specs and auto-builds takeoff, BOM, and a
    priced quote with options.
  targetUsers:
    - Estimators
    - Sales
    - Owners
  triggers:
    - New RFQ with plans/specs
    - Change order request
    - Bid deadline approaching
  inputs:
    - PDF/DWG plans and details
    - 'Spec section (material, finish, thickness)'
    - 'Shop price list (materials, labor rates)'
    - 'Standard edge profiles, cutout libraries'
    - Tax/shipping rules
  steps:
    - Ingest plans/specs; extract stone scope and rooms/areas
    - 'Detect pieces, areas, linear edges, backsplashes, cutouts'
    - >-
      Map specs to material and finish selections; apply shop standards
      (radii/overhangs)
    - >-
      Estimate slab count via quick yield model; compute labor ops and install
      time
    - >-
      Price materials, labor, freight; generate alternates (material, finish,
      thickness)
    - 'Create itemized quote, BOM, assumptions; route for human review'
    - Push approved quote to CRM/accounting
  tools:
    - Autodesk Platform Services (DWG/PDF conversion) or ezdxf/pdfplumber
    - LayoutParser/OpenCV for plan reading
    - LLM for spec extraction
    - Pandas/NumPy for costing
    - QuickBooks Online/Xero API
    - Google/Office docs
  outputs:
    - Itemized quote (PDF/CSV)
    - Annotated takeoff with measurements
    - BOM and labor ops list
    - Assumptions/clarifications list
  pricingModel:
    - Per-RFQ fee

  risks:
    - Plan-reading errors on messy drawings
    - Missing or ambiguous specs
    - Quote liability without human review
    - Unit/tolerance mismatches
  dependencies:
    - Access to price lists and labor rates
    - Material/slab sizes and current costs
    - CRM/accounting connection (optional)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Estimating is slow and manual: 3–8 hours per commercial bid; 20–60
      bids/month; bottlenecked by 1–3 estimators.
    - >-
      Scope gaps and misreads are costly: 2–5% average margin leakage from
      missed details (edge profiles, cutouts, finishes, anchorage hardware).
    - >-
      High variability in drawings/specs: Mixed PDFs/CAD/Revit and spec
      divisions (04/12) lead to missed alternates and noncompliant quotes.
    - >-
      Low bid throughput and win rate: shops submit fewer, slower bids; GCs
      demand 24–72 hour turnaround and value-engineering options.
    - >-
      Poor handoff to production: Takeoff/BOM do not align with slab inventory
      and nesting, creating rework and change orders.
    - >-
      Pricing volatility: Material prices, yield, and labor rates shift weekly;
      quotes often use stale rates or ignore slab yield impacts.
    - >-
      Lack of auditability: Difficult to defend quotes; change-orders lack
      drawing diffs; risk in disputes/chargebacks.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI vision + NLP ingests PDFs/CAD/Revit/specs; detects stone scope
      (slabs/panels), quantities, finishes, edges, cutouts, anchorage details.
    - >-
      Auto-builds takeoff and BOM with slab yield optimization using your price
      book, labor rates, shop routing, and waste factors.
    - >-
      Produces a customer-ready quote with alternates (materials, thickness,
      finishes, edges) and VE suggestions; flags spec noncompliance.
    - >-
      Change-order engine highlights drawing/spec deltas across revisions;
      auto-generates RFIs for ambiguous details.
    - >-
      Integrates with Moraware/CounterGo, Slabsmith, Procore, Bluebeam, Autodesk
      (Revit/AutoCAD), QuickBooks/Netsuite; exports CSV/Excel.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI with confidence scores; estimator validates
      exceptions quickly; full audit trail.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: project-level data isolation, SOC 2 roadmap,
      SSO/SCIM for enterprise.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From plan set to priced, spec-compliant quote in hours, not days. StoneScope
    AI converts drawings/specs to a takeoff, BOM, and optimized price—with VE
    options—integrated to your inventory, price book, and CAM/ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Stone-specialized models, yield-aware pricing engine, and OEM/ERP
    integrations trained on proprietary datasets from lighthouse
    partners—creating a feedback loop others lack. Human-in-the-loop workflows
    tuned for stone details (edges, cutouts, finishes) compress estimator effort
    dramatically while improving auditability.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Stone fabricators, estimators, and shop owners (NAICS 327991) who must turn
    architectural drawings/specs into accurate, professional quotes fast—without
    missing items or eroding margins.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual takeoffs from PDF/DWG are slow, error-prone, and
    inconsistent; missed items and messy change orders cost time and margin.
    Internal: Teams are stretched, worried about under/overbidding, and working
    nights to hit deadlines. Philosophical: Quoting skilled craftsmanship
    shouldn’t be guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’re former stone estimators and manufacturing engineers who built an AI
    trained on stone standards—edge profiles, seam rules, sink cutouts,
    backsplashes/panels, veining, nesting, and slab yield. Proven accuracy, real
    fabricator results, and secure-by-design handling. We understand shop
    reality and speak your language.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload drawings/specs. 2) AI builds takeoff, BOM, cutlist, and a priced
    quote with alternates/VE options. 3) You review, adjust options and pricing
    rules, then export to PDF/Excel or push to ERP/CAD. Onboarding in a day; no
    IT lift; clear pricing; NDA and data privacy guaranteed.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a live demo or start a free trial—send a current plan set and
    receive a sample quote within 24 hours. Transitional: Download the ROI
    calculator and benchmark report; get the integration checklist and sample
    outputs.
  success: >-
    Turn bids around 3–5x faster, win more work at healthy margins, and
    eliminate missed line items. Deliver option-rich, professional quotes; lock
    in consistent pricing; reduce scrap and rework with accurate cutlists; give
    your team back time for fabrication and client relationships.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning nights on manual takeoffs, missing deadlines, and bleeding
    margin through errors, overbuying, and change-order disputes—losing bids to
    faster competitors and frustrating GCs and architects.
