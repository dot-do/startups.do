  problem:
    - >-
      Press release drafting is slow and expensive: 4–6 hours of senior AE time
      per draft plus multiple revision loops raise costs and delay news cycles.
    - >-
      Inconsistent AP and client style compliance causes rework and wire
      rejection risk; teams rely on manual checklists and human editors.
    - >-
      Fact-checking is ad hoc; hallucinations and outdated facts from generic AI
      tools create brand and legal risk.
    - >-
      Quote generation is time-consuming and often generic; securing stakeholder
      approvals stalls timelines.
    - >-
      Wire upload prep (formats, boilerplate, links, multimedia, tags) is
      tedious and error-prone, leading to submission errors and missed
      embargoes.
    - >-
      Agencies lack measurable quality controls at scale across multiple
      accounts and geographies.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI drafting from structured brief: company, news type, key facts, target
      outlets, tone, embargo settings; first draft in under 3 minutes.
    - >-
      Built-in AP and client style compliance: rules-based linter plus model
      guardrails; live score and fix suggestions to 97%+ compliance.
    - >-
      Automated fact-check layer: entity/linkage to authoritative sources
      (company sites, SEC filings, Wikidata), claim detection, citation
      suggestions; red-flags unresolved claims.
    - >-
      Quote generation and personalization: persona-aware quotes for executives,
      partners, customers; approval workflow and versioning.
    - >-
      Wire prep assistant: validates headlines/lengths, multimedia specs,
      boilerplate, formatting, SEO metadata, UTM tagging; exports to PR
      Newswire/Business Wire/GlobeNewswire templates.
    - >-
      Collaboration and governance: roles/permissions, brand kits,
      client-specific glossaries, edit history, audit logs, and
      human-in-the-loop QA mode.
    - >-
      Localization and variants: US/UK English AP variants; optional
      Spanish/French localization with region-specific style rules.
    - >-
      Analytics: turnaround time, revision count, compliance score, error rate;
      per-client dashboards and SLA tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Draft-to-wire press releases in minutes, not hours—AP-style compliant,
    fact-checked, client-ready copy with auto-generated quotes and wire-upload
    prep. Save 70–85% time, cut revisions by 50%, and reduce wire rejections to
    under 1%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    PR agency account leads, copywriters, and freelancers who need on-brief,
    AP-compliant press releases ready for wire upload—fast and error-free.
  problem: >-
    - External: Drafting, quote writing, AP/style QA, fact-checking, and wire
    formatting eat hours and introduce risk.

    - Internal: Embargo pressure and client scrutiny with limited bandwidth
    create last-minute stress.

    - Philosophical: Strong stories deserve speed and accuracy, not production
    bottlenecks.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the 11th-hour scramble before a wire cut-off.

    - Authority: Built around AP style and major wire specs, with layered QA and
    source-backed verifications; configurable brand/voice templates;
    human-in-the-loop by design.
  plan: |-
    - Process:
      1) Upload brief and source docs/links; select client boilerplate and target wire.
      2) AI drafts the release, generates voice-aligned quotes, applies AP style, and flags unverifiable claims.
      3) You review/edit; automated QA enforces style, links, metadata, and character counts; wire package is assembled.
      4) Export a wire-ready bundle (copy, headline/subhead, boilerplate, media, contacts, alt text) or push via template.
    - Agreement:
      - Human final approval required.
      - Confidential by default; your content isn’t used to train models unless you opt in.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a 7-day pilot with two live releases.

    - Transitional: Download the Wire-Ready Release QA checklist and try a
    sample brief.

    - Hit embargoes with fewer revisions.
    - AP-consistent, source-validated copy with client-ready quotes.
