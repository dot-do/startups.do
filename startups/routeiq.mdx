  problem:
    - >-
      Inbound leads lack complete data: 30–50% of web form submissions miss job
      title or company, 20–35% use personal emails, degrading scoring and
      routing accuracy.
    - >-
      Slow, manual enrichment and assignment: 40–70% of teams rely on ops to
      clean and route leads, pushing first-touch response from minutes to hours
      and cutting conversion rates.
    - >-
      Rule-based routing breaks at scale: static, brittle workflows (CRM
      assignment rules, Zapier trees) cause misroutes, SLA breaches, and
      territory disputes as orgs grow or restructure.
    - >-
      Poor lead-to-account matching: duplicates and mismatched parent/subsidiary
      records inflate pipeline, create rep confusion, and hurt attribution and
      forecasting.
    - >-
      Inconsistent scoring: generic MQL thresholds don’t reflect ICP nuances;
      marketing hands off low-fit leads, sales ignores them, lowering acceptance
      rates and trust.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: enrichment from a single provider and no audit trail
      increases GDPR/CCPA risk; consent, source, and data minimization are
      untracked.
    - >-
      Fragmented stack: teams juggle enrichment vendors, lead capture,
      schedulers, and CRMs with brittle integrations and no closed-loop learning
      from outcomes.
    - >-
      Lack of measurement: most orgs can’t quantify match rates, routing time,
      or incremental revenue lift from enrichment/routing investments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time lead enrichment via API/webhooks that federates multiple data
      providers, selects best source per field, and normalizes firmographics and
      contacts.
    - >-
      Lead-to-account matching with proprietary identity resolution using
      domains, fuzzy company names, and IP signals; parent/subsidiary roll-ups
      and territory mapping.
    - >-
      Adaptive ML scoring combining fit (firmographics, technographics) and
      intent (behavioral signals) with clear feature attributions and editable
      rules overlays.
    - >-
      Intelligent routing engine: skills-based, round-robin, load-aware,
      territory/vertical overlays, meeting routing (to schedulers), fallback
      queues, and SLA-aware reassignments.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: continuously refines scoring and routing from
      downstream outcomes (SAL/SQL/won, no-show, disqualified reasons).
    - >-
      Compliance, governance, and audit: consent tracking, source-of-truth
      lineage, field-level policies (PII masking), regional data residency, and
      full audit trails.
    - >-
      Turnkey integrations and UX: native Salesforce/HubSpot/Marketo/Pardot,
      Segment, Slack/Teams; sandbox and A/B routing tests; no-code UI plus
      Terraform/API for infra-as-config.
    - >-
      Observability: match-rate dashboards, p95 latency, coverage by
      region/industry, routing audits, and revenue impact reports with holdout
      tests.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Convert more inbound, faster: real-time multi-source enrichment, ML scoring,
    and skills/territory routing in under 5 seconds with 90%+ lead-to-account
    match accuracy—lifting speed-to-lead and SQL conversion while cutting ops
    toil and data spend.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, cross-tenant learning that optimizes both enrichment source
    selection and routing/scoring from real outcomes, combined with a
    multi-source federation layer and explainable models—delivering faster
    time-to-value and lower data cost per qualified lead than single-source or
    rules-only competitors, with governance built-in.
