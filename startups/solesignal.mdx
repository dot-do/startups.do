  problem:
    - >-
      Footwear e-commerce return rates are 25–35% (fit, comfort, quality
      perception) and erode margin via two-way shipping, processing costs, and
      markdowns.
    - >-
      Return reasons and reviews are unstructured, inconsistent, and siloed
      across RMA systems, email, CS tickets, and marketplaces—making root-cause
      analysis slow and subjective.
    - >-
      Size charts and fit guidance are often generic or wrong by
      brand/last/region (US/EU/UK/CM), causing preventable size-related returns
      and low conversion.
    - >-
      Merchandising and QA teams lack SKU- and batch-level signals to catch
      quality defects (e.g., glue failure in one factory run) early.
    - >-
      Content teams don’t get a prioritized, ROI-quantified backlog of
      copy/imagery fixes that can be pushed and A/B tested quickly.
    - >-
      Retailers can’t tie return reasons to product attributes, cohorts, or
      suppliers to drive corrective actions across PIM/CMS/PLM/QA workflows.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks reliable KPIs that connect content/QA actions to
      return-rate reduction, conversion lift, and avoided logistics costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion: connectors to RMA/returns (Loop, Narvar, Returnly),
      reviews (Yotpo, Bazaarvoice), CS tickets, order/returns in OMS/ERP, and
      product data in PIM/CMS.
    - >-
      Footwear-specific NLP/ML: classify root causes (size/fit, comfort, quality
      defect, color/imagery mismatch, wrong item, expectations) with
      precision/recall >0.9; extract attributes (foot shape mentions, break-in,
      arch support).
    - >-
      Size normalization engine: crosswalk US/EU/UK/CM by brand/last; detect
      skewed size distribution and recommend size chart fixes (e.g., “runs 0.5
      size small for wide feet”).
    - >-
      Action generator: propose copy changes, fit guidance, imagery callouts,
      and size chart updates with expected ROI; push via PIM/CMS and
      Shopify/SFCC app.
    - >-
      QA/Batch anomaly detection: correlate spikes to lot/date/factory;
      auto-open QC tasks with supplier and hold/inspect recommendations.
    - >-
      Prioritization & A/B testing: rank actions by dollarized impact; one-click
      experiments; statistically sound uplift measurement.
    - >-
      Dashboards & alerts: SKU/collection-level return-rate drivers, savings,
      lead-time-to-fix, and supplier scorecards.
    - >-
      Governance & feedback: human-in-the-loop approvals, change logs, and
      learning from outcomes to improve recommendations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn returns and reviews into prioritized, pushed actions that measurably
    reduce size- and quality-related returns. Footwear-specific AI normalizes
    sizing across brands/regions, detects SKU/batch anomalies, rewrites fit copy
    and size charts, and routes QC flags—driving 10–25% return-rate reduction
    and 2–5% conversion lift in 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A footwear-specific size/fit ontology and cross-brand last mappings paired
    with a closed-loop action engine that pushes fixes into PIM/CMS and QA
    systems—continuously learning from outcomes. Network effects emerge from
    aggregated, privacy-preserving benchmarks (e.g., size skew profiles by
    brand/style) that generalist analytics or generic AI copy tools lack.
