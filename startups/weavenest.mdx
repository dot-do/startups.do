    overall: 4.2
  risks:
    - CAD format quirks require mapping
    - 'Real-world constraints (fabric defects, roll joins) may need manual tweaks'
    - Export compatibility with legacy cutters
  dependencies:
    - Sample pattern files and target export format

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High material waste in textile bag and canvas cutting (typical utilization
      78–86%) directly erodes margins in low-ASP products.
    - >-
      Manual/legacy marker making is slow (30–60 minutes/marker) and
      inconsistent across planners and shifts.
    - >-
      Existing CAD/CAM nesting tools are expensive, on-prem only, or locked to
      specific OEMs; many mills operate mixed fleets of cutters/plotters with
      poor software interoperability.
    - >-
      Lay planning doesn’t account for real-world constraints (defects, roll
      width variability, grain/nap, rotation limits, seam allowances), causing
      rework and scrap.
    - >-
      Cutting rooms lack measurable KPIs (utilization%, scrap rate, planner
      throughput), making continuous improvement difficult.
    - >-
      Engineering change cycles (pattern revisions, size runs, custom jobs)
      create bottlenecks and late orders.
    - >-
      Exporting to different machine formats (HPGL/PLT, ISO/NCI, AAMA/ASTM DXF,
      Zünd, Gerber, Lectra, Eastman, Bullmer, Kuris) is error-prone and
      time-consuming.
    - >-
      Many mills need air-gapped or low-latency solutions; current cloud or
      desktop-only tools don’t flexibly support both.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud or on-prem app that imports patterns (AAMA/ASTM DXF, DWG/DXF,
      PLT/HPGL, SVG) and material specs to auto-generate optimal markers.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware nesting: grain/nap, rotation limits (e.g., 0/90/180 or
      0/180), pattern matching for stripes/plaids, notch/hole management, seam
      allowances, buffer/kerf, and allowances per material thickness.
    - >-
      Multi-roll and lay planning: optimizes across roll widths/lengths,
      accounts for defects (via map import), and minimizes remnant sizes.
    - >-
      Fast interactive mode: human-in-the-loop editing with AI suggestions and
      instant recalculation for rush jobs.
    - >-
      Cut-path optimization: reduces head travel and cut time; exports
      machine-ready files (Gerber/Paragon/Atria, Lectra/Vector, Zünd, Eastman,
      Bullmer, Kuris, Orox).
    - >-
      API and batch mode for ERP/MES integration; scheduled nesting for nightly
      production runs.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: material utilization %, scrap %, time-to-marker,
      pieces/hour, yield by order/material; before/after benchmarking for
      pilots.
    - >-
      Offline/edge agent for air-gapped plants, syncing analytics when
      connectivity is available.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven marker and nesting optimization that boosts fabric utilization by
    3–10%, cuts marker creation time by 70–90%, and exports flawlessly to
    mixed-fleet cutters—delivering payback in 6–12 weeks with measurable KPIs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned nesting with roll/defect awareness and a broad, battle-tested
    post-processor library for mixed fleets, delivered as flexible cloud or
    air-gapped on-prem—validated by measurable pilot ROI and datasets others
    lack. Pending IP around fabric-specific heuristic search and defect-map
    fusion.

  character: >-
    Production leaders and CAD/marker-makers at textile bag and canvas mills who
    must deliver more cuts with less fabric, time, and waste.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual or rule‑based marker making wastes fabric and hours and
    struggles with real cutter/plotter constraints. Internal: Constant deadline
    pressure and margin squeeze. Philosophical: Sustainable, precise
    manufacturing shouldn’t rely on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand cutting‑room chaos and last‑minute changeovers. With deep
    textile CAD/CAM and optimization expertise, our AI turns your patterns into
    yield‑optimized markers and exports to the cutter/plotter formats you
    already use—so change feels simple, not risky.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload patterns and fabric rules. 2) Review AI‑optimized markers/nests
    with yield and runtime estimates. 3) Export to your cutter/plotter and track
    savings in production.

  problem:
    - Fabric waste erodes margins across bag and canvas lines.
    - Manual marker-making is slow and inconsistent.
    - Complex grain and rotation rules are hard to enforce at scale.
