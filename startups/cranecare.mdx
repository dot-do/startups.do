leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs, integrators, and end-users struggle to convert CMAA/ASME/OSHA
      requirements into asset-specific PM schedules; most rely on static manuals
      or generic CMMS templates that miss duty and environment nuances.
    - >-
      Inconsistent PM plans lead to non-compliance findings during audits (ASME
      B30/OSHA 1910.179), avoidable downtime, and safety incidents due to
      overlooked tasks or wrong frequencies.
    - >-
      Building PM schedules/checklists/JSAs per asset takes 6–12 hours for
      experienced planners and must be redone when operating conditions or
      standards change.
    - >-
      Maintenance teams lack timely notifications and change tracking for PM
      updates, causing version drift across sites and technicians.
    - >-
      Service companies and OEM field teams need scalable, consistent
      deliverables to standardize PM programs across thousands of installed
      assets and mixed fleets.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI+rules engine maps asset attributes (duty class CMAA A–F/ISO M4–M8,
      capacity, speeds, environment, usage hours, hoist type, controls, safety
      devices) to PM tasks and frequencies per CMAA 70/74, ASME B30
      (B30.2/11/16/17), OSHA 1910.179, and OEM guidance.
    - >-
      Auto-generated deliverables: multi-frequency PM schedule
      (shift/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/semi-annual/annual), checklists with
      acceptance criteria/torque/specs, JSAs with hazard controls, and
      spare-parts lists.
    - >-
      Integration connectors to CMMS/EAM (SAP PM, IBM Maximo, Infor EAM, Oracle,
      Fiix, UpKeep, Limble) to push work orders, routes, and task lists;
      webhook/API for custom systems.
    - >-
      Dynamic frequency adjustment using usage counters/IoT (ISO 12482) and
      inspection findings; change logs and version control for audits.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit pack: citations to standards per task, e-signatures,
      technician competency fields, and site roll-up compliance dashboard.
    - >-
      Multi-site templates, multilingual output, offline-capable mobile
      checklists, and PDF/CSV export for handover packages.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate standards-aligned, asset-specific PM schedules, checklists, JSAs,
    and notifications in minutes—not weeks—tailored to duty class, environment,
    and configuration, continuously updated as standards and conditions evolve,
    and delivered directly into your CMMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, standards-aligned knowledge graph tied to real-world outcomes

  character: >-
    Crane, hoist, and monorail OEMs and service leaders (NAICS 333923) who want
    fast, compliant, asset-specific preventive maintenance programs that scale
    across product lines and customer sites.
  problem: >-
    - External: Standards are complex (CMAA, ASME B30, OSHA). Duty cycles and
    environments vary. Manual PM creation is slow, inconsistent, and hard to
    maintain.

    - Internal: Teams lack time and confidence to keep PMs current—risking
    missed tasks, audit findings, and safety incidents.

    - Philosophical: Preventive maintenance should be precise and proactive, not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to keep cranes safe, compliant, and running. Our
    AI is built with reliability and crane SMEs, aligned to CMAA/ASME and OEM
    guidance, to deliver asset-specific schedules, checklists, JSAs, and
    notifications you can trust.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Import asset data (model, options), duty classification, and
    environment—or connect your CMMS.

    - Step 2: Generate standards-aligned PM schedules, checklists, JSAs, and
    notification cadences.

    - Step 3: Review, brand, and publish to your CMMS/ERP and field app;
    auto-updates track standards changes.

    - Assurance: Secure, audit-traceable, and human-in-the-loop approvals.
