  title: Advisory Dispatch Pack Generator (OFP-lite)
  description: >-
    Creates an advisory operations flight pack: route options, winds, fuel
    calcs, NOTAM/ATIS summaries, alternates, and navlog for pilot validation.
  targetUsers:
    - Small ops without full dispatch
    - Ferry/positioning flights
    - Scenic/air taxi ops

    - Pull winds aloft and compute trip/contingency fuel
    - 'Summarize NOTAMs (field, enroute, airspace)'
    - Propose alternates and min fuel per policy
    - 'Generate navlog, weather brief, and pilot notes'
    - Deliver PDF/JSON to EFB/email
  tools:
    - Flight Plan Database API (routing)
    - NOAA/NWS GFS winds
    - AviationWeather.gov (METAR/TAF/SIGMET)
    - OpenAIP/terrain
    - PDF generator
  outputs:
    - Advisory OFP/navlog
    - Wx/NOTAM brief
    - Fuel plan and alternates
  pricingModel:
    - Per-flight fee
    - Bundle with FRAT/crew legality

  risks:
    - Not a certified dispatch plan—must be pilot-validated
    - Incorrect performance inputs
    - Airspace/route restrictions missed without premium data
  dependencies:
    - Accurate aircraft performance and reserve policy
    - Pilot/dispatcher review SOP
    - Access to routing/weather data
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Small/midsize Part 135 operators and air taxis lack dedicated dispatchers;
      PICs spend 30–60 minutes per leg compiling routes, NOTAMs, weather, fuel,
      alternates, and a navlog.
    - >-
      NOTAM overload: typical IFR city‑pair can surface 80–300 NOTAMs; critical
      items (RWY/TWY closures, nav aid outages, TFRs, FICON) are buried and easy
      to miss.
    - >-
      Fuel planning inconsistencies across crews and aircraft; applying
      operator‑specific reserve, contingency, and alternate policies is
      error‑prone and time‑consuming.
    - >-
      Alternate selection often ad‑hoc; pilots may over‑conservatively choose
      alternates (added cost) or miss better choices given weather windows,
      NOTAMs, curfews, or customs hours.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling: pilots bounce across FltPlan.com/ForeFlight, NOTAM
      portals, weather sites, and spreadsheets, increasing error risk and
      extending turn times.
    - >-
      Short‑notice on‑demand flying needs rapid “go/no‑go” advisories; existing
      enterprise flight planning tools are heavy, expensive, and optimized for
      scheduled ops, not point‑to‑point charters.
    - >-
      Auditability gaps: operators need a retained advisory briefing with data
      sources/timestamps to satisfy internal QA and customer queries without
      implying “operational control” in jurisdictions where that’s restricted.
    - >-
      Trust and liability: crews want conservative, transparent calculations
      they can validate and override; many current tools act as black boxes.
  solution:
    - >-
      One‑click advisory flight pack: ingest origin/destination/ETD/aircraft and
      produce a complete OFP‑lite PDF/JSON packet within 90 seconds.
    - >-
      Route options engine: proposes 2–4 wind‑aware, constraint‑compliant routes
      (preferred/TEC/CCFP‑aware domestically; user‑defined exclusions) with
      rationale and enroute time/fuel deltas.
    - >-
      Fuel calculator: aircraft‑specific burn with taxi, climb/cruise/descent
      profiles; operator‑configurable reserves (e.g., required to destination,
      most distant alternate, 45‑min at normal consumption) plus contingency and
      holding policies.
    - >-
      NOTAM summarization: NLP triage ranks critical items first (runway
      closures, ILS outages, GPS RAIM/ADS‑B, airspace/TFRs, customs/immigration
      hours, lighting) with links to full text; filters irrelevant
      administrative NOTAMs while preserving audit view.
    - >-
      Weather/ATIS: consolidate METAR/TAF, AIRMET/SIGMET, winds aloft,
      icing/turbulence forecasts, PIREPs; D‑ATIS summaries displayed where
      available, else METAR+NOTAM‑derived field condition summary.
    - >-
      Alternates recommender: suggests 1–3 alternates meeting operator minima
      and runway/approach requirements, with forecast windows, NOTAM
      constraints, and fuel/time implications.
    - >-
      Navlog: leg‑by‑leg waypoint listing with winds, ETE, fuel remaining,
      cruise levels, EET to FIR boundaries, and top‑of‑climb/descent marks.
    - >-
      Live updates: if ETD shifts or weather/NOTAMs change materially, push a
      concise change summary and revised pack via EFB/email/SMS.
    - >-
      Pilot validation workflow: red‑flag checks (range vs fuel, required
      equipment vs MEL/CDL, runway length vs performance assumptions); pilot
      must accept/override with reason, creating an audit trail.
    - >-
      Data lineage: every figure shows source/time (e.g., NOAA ADDS timestamp,
      NOTAM ID) and policy version so QA can reconstruct the brief.
    - >-
      Advisory boundary: no flight plan filing or operational control
      assertions; language clearly positions outputs as pilot advisory for
      91.103/135 preflight action.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate a pilot‑validated, advisory OFP in under 2 minutes—route options,
    weather/winds, fuel per your policy, NOTAM/ATIS summaries, alternates, and a
    navlog—tuned to your aircraft and SOPs, with transparent calculations, audit
    trails, and EFB delivery at a fraction of full dispatch cost.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Operator‑tuned policy engine and NOTAM NLP models trained on 135‑specific
    significance, coupled with per‑tail performance calibration and an
    audit‑first design that builds crew trust. The system explains every
    recommendation and improves from structured pilot feedback, creating a
    proprietary dataset competitors lack.
