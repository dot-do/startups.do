  problem:
    - >-
      Temperature excursions in storage/transport (refrigerated 0–5°C) occur in
      5–15% of legs for perishable prepared foods; detection is often delayed or
      missed due to manual logging or siloed systems, leading to preventable
      waste and service failures.
    - >-
      Manufacturers lack a reliable way to convert time–temperature history into
      remaining shelf-life per SKU; rules-of-thumb and static thresholds cause
      over-disposal or unsafe releases.
    - >-
      Excursion response is fragmented across QA, WMS/TMS, and carriers; rework,
      reroute, or relabel decisions are ad hoc, causing OTIF degradation and
      retail chargebacks.
    - >-
      Claims against carriers/insurers are slow and under-recovered due to
      incomplete chain-of-custody evidence and poor root-cause documentation.
    - >-
      Regulatory and audit requirements (FSMA, HACCP, GFSI/SQF/BRC) demand
      documented controls and traceability, but data from sensors, WMS, and
      telematics is scattered and inconsistent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ingestion of temperature/humidity/location from existing
      loggers, telematics, and gateways (e.g., Sensitech, Tive, Emerson,
      Controlant, Berlinger, Samsara), plus WMS/TMS/ERP/QMS data.
    - >-
      Physics-informed shelf-life engine (Arrhenius/Q10 models and
      product-specific microbiological growth curves) calibrated per SKU and
      validated against historical spoilage/returns.
    - >-
      Decision orchestration agent that auto-triggers SOPs: rework (rapid chill,
      cook-chill, QC retest), dynamic relabeling (shorter best-by), reroute to
      closer DC/customers, or quarantine and claim initiation.
    - >-
      Claims automation: compile a defensible chain-of-custody packet (sensor
      data, custody events, route, ambient vs product temps, SOP adherence) and
      submit to carriers/insurers; track outcomes.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready audit trails and analytics: HACCP logs, FSMA preventive
      controls, GFSI templates; root-cause analysis across lanes, carriers,
      facilities, and time.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: quantify financial and service impacts of alternate
      pack-outs, setpoints, carrier selection, and route planning to harden the
      cold chain.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every time–temperature trace into a dollar decision: detect excursions
    in minutes, quantify shelf-life loss per SKU, and orchestrate
    rework/reroute/claims to cut temperature-related waste 20–40%, preserve
    OTIF, and prove compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-ecosystem dataset linking time–temperature traces to real financial
    outcomes (shrink, shelf-life at delivery, claims) plus a validated SKU-level
    shelf-life model library. Prebuilt orchestration playbooks and claims
    packets accepted by major carriers/insurers reduce time-to-cash. Deep
    integrations with leading sensor and WMS/TMS platforms minimize switching
    costs and enable rapid pilots.

    QA, Operations, and Logistics leaders at perishable prepared food
    manufacturers who must protect freshness, compliance, and margins across the
    cold chain.
  problem: >-
    External: Temperature excursions in storage and transport silently erode
    shelf life, triggering waste and chargebacks. Internal: Teams lack real-time
    visibility and actionable playbooks to respond confidently. Philosophical:
    It’s wrong to discard good food or ship compromised product.

    We understand the 2 a.m. “is this lot safe?” pressure. Our team blends
    food-safety and ML expertise, with SKU-level kinetic models and workflows
    aligned to HACCP/FSMA—deployments audited and production-proven.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sensors/telematics and ERP/WMS data. 2) Configure SKUs and
    stability models. 3) Go live: detect excursions, estimate shelf-life loss,
    and orchestrate rework/reroute/claims. 4) Review results and tune rules for
    continuous ROI.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot with your lanes and
    SKUs. Transitional: Get the data‑readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Excursions caught early, safe salvage via guided rework/reroute, less waste
    and fewer chargebacks, faster claim recovery, audit‑ready records, stronger
    customer trust, and reliable OTIF quality.
  failure: >-
    Unseen shelf‑life loss leads to spoilage, margin erosion, penalties and
    recalls, damaged brand reputation, and lost customers.
