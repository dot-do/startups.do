  title: Demand Forecasting & Capacity-Constrained Production Planning
  description: >-
    Forecast SKU demand and generate an optimized daily/weekly production plan
    under kiln/press constraints.
  targetUsers:
    - Plant Manager
    - Scheduler/Planner
    - Operations Director
  triggers:
    - Weekly planning cycle
    - Large project/RFQ added
    - Seasonal change or holiday period
  inputs:
    - 24–36 months order history by SKU/customer
    - Current open orders/backlog
    - SKU-to-mold mapping and changeover times
    - Press/kiln capacities and curing times
    - Downtime/maintenance calendar
    - Lead times for cement/aggregates/pigments
    - Holidays/weather (optional)
  steps:
    - Ingest and clean historical order and capacity data
    - Forecast SKU-level demand (short- and mid-term)
    - Translate demand into mold-hours and curing slots
    - >-
      Run capacity-constrained schedule optimization (minimize changeovers,
      lateness)
    - Generate material requirements plan (cement/aggregate/admixture)
    - Publish plan to shared sheet/dashboard and email exceptions
    - Iterate weekly with actuals vs plan
  tools:
    - Python/Pandas
    - Prophet/LightGBM
    - OR-Tools
    - Google Sheets/Excel API
    - Power BI/Looker Studio
  outputs:
    - 12-week SKU demand forecast
    - Daily/weekly production schedule (by press/kiln)
    - Material requirements and purchase timing
    - Exception/overload report and what-if scenarios
  pricingModel:
    - One-time setup fee + monthly subscription
    - Optional per-plant pricing
    - Change-request hourly rate
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 8.5
  risks:
    - Poor historical data quality or SKU changes
    - 'Unmodeled constraints (e.g., pallet flow, yard limits)'
    - Construction project cancellations affecting accuracy
  dependencies:
    - 'ERP/MES export or API (e.g., SAP B1, NetSuite, Odoo)'
    - Access to capacity calendars and BOMs
    - Stakeholder approval of constraints/assumptions
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      SKU-level demand in concrete masonry is highly volatile due to
      seasonality, weather, and project schedules, leading to 20–40% forecast
      error in many plants.
    - >-
      Production is constrained by press capacity, molds, curing kilns/rooms,
      racks, pallets, pigment stations, and yard space; schedules are often
      built in spreadsheets without optimizing these constraints.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers (mold and color changes) create hidden
      capacity losses of 5–15% when not optimized.
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts of high-velocity SKUs (e.g., standard CMU in popular
      colors/sizes) and overproduction of slow-movers increase working capital
      and lost sales.
    - >-
      Raw material variability (cement allocations, pigment lead times) and
      maintenance windows are not incorporated into planning, causing mid-week
      schedule disruptions.
    - >-
      Data quality issues (inconsistent SKU hierarchies, sparse historical data,
      manual entries) hinder reliable forecasting and planning.
    - >-
      Multi-plant producers lack load-balancing and make cross-plant transfers
      reactively, raising freight costs and service risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from ERP/MES/PLC for orders, shipments, production counts,
      downtimes, mold usage, curing times, and inventory.
    - >-
      SKU-location forecasting using hierarchical ML with seasonality, weather,
      and project pipelines; cold-start logic for new SKUs.
    - >-
      Capacity-constrained scheduling that models presses, molds, curing
      rooms/kilns, racks/pallets, sequence-dependent changeovers, maintenance,
      and yard limits.
    - >-
      Safety stock and service-level policy optimizer per SKU/location with cost
      trade-offs.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: demand surges, cement allocation cuts, kiln outage,
      adding a shift, or mold swap plans.
    - >-
      Multi-plant load balancing and transfer recommendations with freight and
      lead-time trade-offs.
    - >-
      Exception-driven workflow: shortages, line saturation, late orders, high
      scrap risk, and pigment constraints.
    - >-
      User-friendly planner UI with drag-and-drop overrides, visual Gantt of
      presses/kilns, and mobile read-only for supervisors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut forecast error 20–40% and raise usable capacity 5–10% by generating
    SKU-level demand forecasts and an optimized daily/weekly schedule that
    respects press, mold, kiln, curing, changeover, and yard-space
    constraints—deployable in 6–10 weeks with a typical 3–6 month ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized models and constraint templates specifically for CMU/brick
    (press/mold/curing realities) plus transfer learning from a growing,
    anonymized dataset of plants—enabling faster, more accurate schedules than
    generic APS tools. OEM/ERP connectors and mold-family/changeover libraries
    reduce time-to-value and create switching cost.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-sized regional concrete block and brick manufacturers (1–5 plants)
      seeking better service levels with limited planning staff.
    - >-
      Large multi-plant producers (6–25+ plants) needing network-level
      optimization and cross-plant balancing.
    - >-
      Single-plant operators with high SKU mix (colors/textures) and tight
      kiln/yard constraints.
    - >-
      Operations leadership roles: COO/VP Operations, Plant Managers, Production
      Schedulers, Inventory/Materials Planners, Sales Operations.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to plant/operations leaders via targeted outreach and
      account-based marketing.
    - >-
      Partnerships with equipment OEMs (e.g., Besser, Columbia Machine, Masa,
      HESS) to co-market and bundle during line upgrades.
    - >-
      Alliances with ERPs/MES/IIoT vendors (Microsoft Dynamics 365 partners,
      Epicor, Infor, SAP B1; Inductive Automation/Ignition integrators).

      Association (CMHA), World of Concrete, regional CMU conferences; sponsor
      workshops on scheduling ROI.

  character: >-
    Plant managers and production schedulers at concrete block and brick
    manufacturers (NAICS 327331) who must hit service levels and maximize kiln
    and press throughput.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile SKU mix, seasonal swings, kiln/press and curing capacity
    limits, long mold changeovers, rising material and energy costs. Internal:
    constant firefighting and spreadsheet guesswork erode confidence.
    Philosophical: vital building materials should ship on time without waste or
    chaos.
  guide: >-
    We understand the realities of block and brick plants. Our team blends
    former plant planners with OR/ML experts, with proven results in building
    materials. We listen first, map your constraints, and use transparent,
    validated models that integrate with your ERP/MES.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: orders, SKUs, BOMs, routings, calendars, downtime. 2)
    Forecast SKU-level demand and test scenarios. 3) Generate optimized
    daily/weekly schedules under kiln, press, and curing constraints, minimizing
    changeovers and cost. 4) Review and adjust in the app, then publish to ERP;
    the model learns each cycle.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30-minute demo and start a 2-week pilot using your last 12
    months of data. Transitional: get the capacity-constrained planning playbook
    and a sample schedule.
  success: >-
    Consistent on-time delivery near 98%, higher kiln and press utilization,
    10-20% inventory reduction, fewer changeovers, lower overtime and energy per
    unit, clear 12-week visibility, and confident customer commitments.
  failure: >-
    Stay stuck in reactive scheduling: missed orders, stockouts or excess
    inventory, hot loads and rush costs, wasted kiln capacity, planner burnout,
    and lost customers.
