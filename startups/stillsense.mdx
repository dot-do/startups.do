leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent cut decisions (heads/hearts/tails) lead to 1–5% avoidable
      yield loss and flavor variability, especially across shifts and staff
      turnover.
    - >-
      Operators rely on sensory cues and manual logs; limited use of
      multi-sensor data (ABV, temperature, reflux ratio, flow) for predictive
      control.
    - >-
      No standardized pre-run planning or post-run analytics to quantify what
      drove outcomes and how to improve next run.
    - >-
      Scaling production or moving to new equipment introduces learning curves
      that cause weeks of suboptimal runs and wasted spirit.
    - >-
      Energy and water use during runs are not optimized, increasing cost per
      liter of pure alcohol (LPA) by 3–10%.
    - >-
      Compliance and quality documentation is time-consuming; data is siloed
      across SCADA, spreadsheets, and paper run sheets.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven cut timing predictions using historical runs, mash bill, charge
      volume/ABV, still geometry, heat input, reflux ratio, ambient conditions,
      and inline sensor data.
    - >-
      Live guidance during runs: heads/hearts/tails countdowns with confidence
      bands, alarms, and recommended recycle volumes; adaptive updates as
      conditions drift.
    - >-
      Pre-run planning: run sheet generator with predicted timelines, expected
      yields (heads/hearts/tails), target energy/water use, and sensor
      calibration checklist.
    - >-
      Post-run review: variance analysis versus plan, root-cause insights (e.g.,
      heater ramp, condenser temp), and A/B comparisons across recipes,
      operators, or equipment settings.
    - >-
      Scenario modeling: what-if predictions for recipe tweaks, charge size,
      heat profiles, or cuts to meet target flavor/COGS.
    - >-
      Integration kit: connectors for common flow/ABV meters,
      temperature/pressure sensors, and SCADA/PLC; CSV/log import for low-sensor
      environments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict the optimal cut windows and expected yields before and during each
    run, then generate run sheets and post-run insights that turn every
    distillation into a measurable, continuously improving process—delivering
    +1–3% more hearts yield, 20–40% cut variance reduction, and 5–10% faster
    operator training time-to-proficiency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, anonymized, cross-distillery dataset fused with physics-informed
    ML enables accurate, site-specific predictions faster than competitors
    reliant on generic models; validated ROI case studies and OEM/integrator
    partnerships reduce time-to-value and create switching costs through deep
    integrations and operator workflows.

  character: >-
    Head distillers and production managers who want consistent quality,
    maximized hearts yield, and predictable runs—without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: Uncertain cut timing, variable yields, inconsistent run sheets and
    notes. Internal: Pressure to hit flavor and volume targets, second-guessing
    during the run. Philosophical: Great spirits shouldn’t be left to
    guesswork—craft deserves data that elevates the art.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of balancing flavor, yield, and schedules on
    tight margins. Our team of distillers, process engineers, and data
    scientists built an AI that learns from your historical runs and conditions
    to give clear, actionable predictions—while you stay in control.
  plan: >-
    1) Import past run data and configure still profiles. 2) Run with live
    heads/hearts/tails predictions, expected yields, and printable run sheets.
    3) Post-run review auto-logs results and continuously improves
    recommendations. Assurances: You own your data, can override at any time,
    and can export with no lock-in.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot run. Transitional: Download a sample
    run sheet or request a free analysis of one past run.
  success: >-
    Consistent cuts and flavor profiles; higher usable hearts yield; fewer
    reruns and less waste; faster onboarding; predictable schedules; clear audit
    trail; confident, data-backed decisions.
  failure: >-
    Inconsistent batches and smeared cuts; lost hearts and margin; overtime and
    schedule slips; avoidable compliance issues; dependence on tribal knowledge
    that may walk out the door.
