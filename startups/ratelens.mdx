  title: Supplier Contract Ingestion & Rate Normalization
  description: >-
    Parses supplier rate sheets and contracts into clean, comparable data with
    alerts on anomalies and expiries.
  targetUsers:
    - Product Manager
    - Reservations Manager
  triggers:
    - New contract email received
    - Contract uploaded to ‘Rates’ folder
    - Contract nearing expiry
  inputs:
    - PDF/Excel rate sheets
    - 'Contract terms (blackouts, child policies, taxes)'
    - 'Existing master data (room types, SKUs)'
  steps:
    - OCR/parse documents and extract tables
    - 'Normalize fields (dates, meal plans, cancellation, currency)'
    - Map to master inventory SKUs and detect duplicates/gaps
    - 'Compute derived fields (net, gross, tax-inclusive)'

    - Publish to Google Sheets/database and notify team
  tools:
    - AWS Textract/Google Vision
    - Python/Node parsers
    - Google Sheets/Airtable
    - LLM for schema mapping
    - Slack/Email notifications
  outputs:
    - Normalized rate table
    - Anomaly report
    - Expiry/blackout calendar
  pricingModel:
    - Per contract/page
    - Monthly retainer for continuous ingestion
    - Optional QA add-on (human validation)

    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4.2
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - OCR errors on complex tables
    - Mis-mapped SKUs causing wrong pricing
    - Legal term misinterpretation
  dependencies:
    - Access to rate emails/folders
    - Master data dictionary
    - Currency/tax rules
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier contracts and rate sheets arrive in dozens of formats (PDF scans,
      Excel, email text) across multiple languages and templates, forcing 2–6
      hours of manual data entry and validation per supplier contract.
    - >-
      High error rates in policy interpretation (child/extra bed, cancellation
      tiers, taxes, blackout dates, stop-sell) cause revenue leakage (0.5–2% of
      gross bookings) and compliance risk under Package Travel Regulations.
    - >-
      Rates and policies are not normalized, making cross-supplier comparisons
      and margin optimization difficult; teams spend hours reconciling
      currencies, seasons, board bases, and occupancy rules.
    - >-
      Contract expiries and amendments are missed; operators unknowingly sell
      expired or superseded rates, triggering rework, penalties, and customer
      dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Contract loading backlogs spike during contracting seasons (Q4–Q2),
      delaying time-to-market by weeks and causing lost sales on new product
      ranges.
    - >-
      Existing solutions (generic OCR, BPOs, manual loading) have slow SLAs
      (48–72 hours+), limited policy accuracy (<95%), lack anomaly/expiry
      alerts, and poor integration to core reservation systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-format ingestion: drag-and-drop portal, secure email forwarding,
      SFTP, and API for PDFs, images, XLS/XLSX/CSV, and email text;
      auto-language detection (EN/ES/FR/DE/IT/PT).
    - >-
      Travel-specific parsing: extract rates by season/room/occupancy/board,
      taxes/fees, child policies, free-night offers, stop-sell/blackout dates,
      release periods, allotments, cancellation/amendment schedules, and
      validity ranges.
    - >-
      Normalization engine: standardize currencies (daily FX), seasons,
      room/board codes, occupancy models, and policy semantics into a consistent
      schema mapped to each client’s PMS/CRS/booking system.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection and alerts: flag outliers vs supplier history and peer
      set (e.g., sudden 25% rate drop in peak season), policy conflicts, missing
      fields, and upcoming expiries/allocations; configurable thresholds and
      workflows.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: reviewer queues for low-confidence fields;
      side-by-side contract view; full audit trail and versioning; acceptance
      flows before sync.
    - >-
      Sync and integrations: push to systems like Tourplan, Juniper, ISO Travel
      Solutions, Dolphin Dynamics, Travel Studio, or export via API/CSV;
      webhooks for updates.
    - >-
      Governance and security: role-based access, SSO, PII redaction, encryption
      at rest/in transit, GDPR readiness, SOC 2 roadmap (or certification when
      achieved).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn supplier rate sheets and contracts into clean, comparable, and
    actionable data in hours—not weeks— with 98.5%+ field-level accuracy,
    anomaly and expiry alerts, and one-click sync to your reservation system.
    Reduce loading time by 70%+, cut revenue leakage by 0.5–1.5%, and gain
    instant cross-supplier comparability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A travel-specific contract ontology and labeled dataset spanning thousands
    of supplier templates and policy variations, reinforced by tight
    integrations with leading reservation systems and feedback loops from
    human-in-the-loop QA—creating a data network effect that generic document AI
    or BPOs cannot easily replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tour operators and contracting teams who need clean, comparable supplier
    rates without manual spreadsheet work.
  problem: >-
    External: Supplier rate sheets arrive as PDFs, emails, and messy
    spreadsheets with inconsistent formats, seasons, and exceptions. Internal:
    Hours lost reconciling data, fear of hidden errors, and deadline stress.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to be a data janitor to price confidently
    and protect margin.
  guide: >-
    We understand contract chaos and how fragile pricing can be. Our
    travel-trained AI and deterministic validation rules turn unstructured
    contracts into reliable, auditable data—securely and consistently.
  plan: >-
    Three steps: 1) Upload supplier contracts and rate sheets. 2) We parse,
    normalize, and map rates, seasons, supplements, and policies; auto-flag
    anomalies and expiries. 3) You review, approve, and sync to pricing or
    booking tools. Start with a 2-week pilot on top suppliers.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download
    sample output and data dictionary, or upload a sample contract for a free
    test ingestion.
  success: >-
    All supplier rates in one standard schema; apples-to-apples comparisons;
    instant anomaly and expiry alerts; faster contracting cycles; fewer pricing
    errors; protected margins; full audit trail and version history.
  failure: >-
    Remain stuck in manual reconciliations, miss expiries, leak margin through
    errors, miscompare supplier offers, and delay product launches while
    competitors price faster.
