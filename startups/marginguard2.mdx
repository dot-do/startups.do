leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Margin erosion from commodity volatility (corn/soy/DDGS/fats) due to
      static price lists and manual quote updates; 50–200 bps margin leakage
      common during rapid price moves.
    - >-
      Slow, error-prone quoting: sales relies on formulators and spreadsheets;
      quote cycle time measured in hours/days, not minutes—lost deals and poor
      price responsiveness.
    - >-
      Inconsistent enforcement of margin floors and approval policies by
      customer/region/product; discounts and freight concessions bypass
      controls.
    - >-
      Least-cost formulations aren’t recalculated at quote time using current
      input costs, causing negative margins at fulfillment when costs rise.
    - >-
      Freight, energy surcharges, and mill capacity constraints aren’t embedded
      in pricing; quotes ignore true landed COGS and lead times.
    - >-
      Disjointed systems (formulation software, ERP, CRM, hedging) create data
      latency; cost pass-through from market to quote takes days.
    - >-
      Limited ability to offer indexed/escaltor-based pricing tied to market
      references with automatic resets and auditability.
    - >-
      No closed-loop measurement of price realization vs. floors at invoice;
      finance can’t quantify leakage or coach behaviors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time cost engine ingests commodity prices (cash/basis/futures),
      premix/micro pricing, freight matrices, and energy surcharges to compute
      current COGS by mill.
    - >-
      Formulation-aware CPQ recalculates least-cost formulations per customer
      spec (nutrient targets, ingredient constraints, palatability, brand rules)
      at quote time using linear programming.
    - >-
      Margin Guard applies customer/product/region-specific floors, freight
      policies, and payment terms; blocks or routes for approval if a quote
      risks margin floors.
    - >-
      Multi-mode pricing: spot, formula-priced, and indexed to market (e.g.,
      CBOT corn + basis + conversion); automatically refreshes with market moves
      under contract rules.
    - >-
      Quote-to-contract workflow with e-signature, validity windows, volume
      brackets, and escalators; pushes orders to ERP and formulation systems
      when accepted.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics: tracks price realization vs. floors at invoice,
      variance to predicted COGS at fulfillment, and root causes of leakage
      (freight, overrides, index timing).
    - >-
      Optional hedging assist: links accepted indexed/volume contracts to
      suggested hedge coverage by month to reduce basis/flat price exposure.
    - >-
      APIs/connectors for BESTMIX/Brill, SAP/Infor/Dynamics/Deacom/Aptean,
      Salesforce/Dynamics CRM, and logistics/TMS for delivered pricing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quote in minutes with guaranteed floor margins. Our AI-driven CPQ
    recalculates least-cost formulations at live input costs, applies
    customer-specific guardrails, and automates approvals—so you win deals
    faster while protecting 50–200 bps of margin and eliminating out-of-spec
    quotes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A formulation-native CPQ with embedded margin guard and real-time cost
    ingestion purpose-built for feed manufacturing—closing the loop from market
    to quote to invoice. Over time, proprietary benchmarks on acceptance curves
    by segment, lane, and spec enable superior price recommendations and
    approval automation that general CPQ or generic pricing tools cannot match.

    safeguarding margins.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile ingredient costs and customer-specific nutrition specs
    make quoting slow and risky; spreadsheets and ad‑hoc discounts leak margin.

    - Internal: Teams feel torn between winning the bid and protecting profit;
    leaders lack confidence in pricing discipline.
