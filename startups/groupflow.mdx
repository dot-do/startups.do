  problem:
    - >-
      Elevator/escalator (E/E) systems are often over- or under-sized due to
      static, manual traffic studies, causing either excessive capex (extra
      shafts/equipment) or poor service levels (long waits/queues) after
      handover.
    - >-
      Group control parameters (e.g., zoning, parking, load weighting, DD logic)
      are rarely tuned for actual building use; default settings leave 10–30%
      performance on the table.
    - >-
      Current tools are fragmented: OEM-specific planners, spreadsheets, or
      general-purpose simulators not calibrated to real IoT data, leading to
      inaccurate predictions and slow iteration (days/weeks).
    - >-
      Modernization projects need evidence-based ROI; without accurate
      simulation and tuning, owners resist upgrades or choose costly hardware
      changes over cheaper software optimization.
    - >-
      Post-occupancy performance drifts as tenant mix and schedules change; no
      closed-loop process exists to re-optimize continuously.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud and on-prem discrete-event simulation engine pre-calibrated to VT
      standards (ISO 4190, CIBSE Guide D) and augmented with machine-learned
      arrival models from real buildings.
    - >-
      Reinforcement-learning and Bayesian optimization to tune 200+ control
      parameters (zoning, parking, load weighting, DD prioritization) to
      specific building use profiles and KPIs (AWT, interval, handling capacity,
      energy).
    - >-
      BIM-integrated building model ingestion (Revit/IFC) and automatic bank
      configuration generator; scenario wizard for
      up-peak/down-peak/lunch/inter-floor/hotel/healthcare.
    - >-
      Digital twin loop: ingest controller/BMS/IoT logs, calibrate simulation to
      observed data (MAPE target <10% on wait time), re-tune and deploy
      parameter sets via partner APIs.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready reports and value engineering outputs quantifying shaft
      reductions, car size/type changes, energy impacts, and SLA forecasts.

    Elevator and moving stairway manufacturers and engineering/bid teams who
    must size systems and guarantee ride performance.
  problem: >-
    External: Building traffic is unpredictable and multi-use. Internal: Teams
    lack time and confidence to set group-control parameters that hit KPIs.
    Philosophical: No one should gamble on wait times, capacity, or passenger
    experience.

    clear, defensible sizing and tuning guidance, aligned with industry best
    practices and real-world usage patterns.

    1) Provide building data (BIM/CSV: floors, uses, populations, arrival
    patterns). 2) We simulate scenarios, size equipment, and tune
    group-control/destination-dispatch parameters to target handling capacity
    and wait-time KPIs (incl. escalator flow and scheduling). 3) Deliver a
    validated report, parameter set, and optional live A/B tuning and
    monitoring.
