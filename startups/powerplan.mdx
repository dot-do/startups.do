  problem:
    - >-
      Experiment design and power analysis are slow and error‑prone; researchers
      commonly spend 8–20 hours per study crafting designs, iterating with
      statisticians, and revising for IRB/journal feedback.
    - >-
      Mis-specified models and improper power calculations lead to underpowered
      or overpowered studies, wasted budget, and inconclusive results.
    - >-
      Preregistration and analysis plan requirements (IRBs, funders, journals)
      increase documentation burden; formats are inconsistent and duplication is
      common.
    - >-
      Existing tools (e.g., calculators, DOE point solutions) don’t support
      complex, real‑world designs (clustered/longitudinal/adaptive/missing data)
      or force users into formulas that don’t match their analysis model.
    - >-
      Small labs, NGOs, and startups lack access to expert biostatistics
      support; consulting is expensive and turnaround times delay projects.
    - >-
      Reproducibility and audit trails are weak; design rationale, simulation
      settings, and code are rarely captured end‑to‑end, complicating peer
      review and replication.
  solution:
    - >-
      Interactive AI design assistant: captures research question, outcomes,
      constraints, and resources; proposes candidate designs with trade‑offs
      (cost, time, precision, ethics).
    - >-
      Simulation‑based power and sensitivity analysis engine: Monte Carlo and
      analytical hybrids that match the intended analysis model (GLM/GLMM, mixed
      models, survival, nonparametric, Bayesian).
    - >-
      Preregistration and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) generator: produces
      OSF/AsPredicted prereg text, IRB submission appendices, and
      journal‑friendly methods sections.
    - >-
      Code generation and reproducible reports: exports R/Python notebooks and
      scripts, plus a version‑controlled design dossier with assumptions,
      priors, data‑quality checks, and analysis pipelines.
    - >-
      Design governance and validation: built‑in checks (assumption diagnostics,
      model identifiability, multiplicity control, missing data mechanisms), and
      auto‑generated sensitivity scenarios.
    - >-
      Integrations: OSF/AsPredicted, REDCap/Qualtrics/Castor, GitHub/GitLab,
      JASP/jamovi, RStudio, and common ELNs; API for CROs and enterprise
      workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, simulation‑first AI workflow that mirrors real analysis models,
