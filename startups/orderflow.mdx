leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High manual effort and latency to ingest EDI 850 purchase orders into ERPs
      (Epicor P21, Infor SX.e/CloudSuite, D365 BC, NetSuite, SAP B1, Acumatica),
      causing delays and missed SLAs.
    - >-
      Frequent exceptions (price mismatches, item cross-references, pack-size
      conversions, min-order quantities, shipping windows, address/compliance
      errors) create rework and require senior EDI analysts.
    - >-
      Costly chargebacks and retailer compliance penalties due to late or
      incorrect 855 acknowledgments, 856 ASNs, or UCC-128 label/pack detail
      inaccuracies.
    - >-
      Seasonal spikes (back-to-school, calendar-year-end) overwhelm order-entry
      teams; staffing up is expensive and slow to train.
    - >-
      Legacy EDI translators and iPaaS tools move data but don’t interpret
      business rules; IT must maintain brittle mappings and custom scripts per
      trading partner.
    - >-
      Limited end-to-end visibility: ops leaders lack real-time metrics on
      touchless rates, exception root causes, and chargeback risk by trading
      partner.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest EDI 850s from VAN/AS2/SFTP, normalize and validate
      against customer/item/price contracts, and auto-create sales orders in the
      ERP with accurate ship dates, pack sizes, and backorder logic.
    - >-
      Auto-generate and transmit EDI 855 order acknowledgments and 856 ASNs with
      correct pack/carton hierarchy and UCC-128 labels; track and enforce
      trading-partner-specific compliance rules.
    - >-
      AI exception triage: explain issues (e.g., price variance, invalid SKU,
      ship-window conflict), propose resolution (substitute SKU, price override
      within tolerance, split shipment), and route for approval in
      Slack/Teams/email with one-click actions.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors and mappings for top ERPs, VANs, and common
      office-supply trading partners; reusable cross-reference catalogs for
      SKUs, GTINs, and pack sizes.
    - >-
      Real-time dashboard: touchless rate, exception reasons and cycle time, ASN
      timeliness, chargeback risk, and per-partner SLA performance.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: model improves from approved resolutions; monitoring
      to catch map drift, master-data changes, and new partner requirements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    90%+ touchless EDI-to-ERP order creation in under 2 minutes, with AI-driven
    exception reasoning that reduces chargebacks 30–50% and cuts EDI labor
    50–70%—all with human-in-the-loop approvals where it matters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific exception corpus and rule packs for office-supply trading
    partners, plus SKU/pack-size cross-reference libraries that enable high
    initial touchless rates. Combined with deep ERP connectors (P21, SX.e, D365,
    NetSuite) and human-in-the-loop workflows embedded in Slack/Teams, this
    yields faster time-to-value and lower exception rates than generic EDI/iPaaS
    or RPA tools.
