  problem:
    - >-
      Application engineers at hydraulic pump/motor manufacturers spend 4–12
      hours per inquiry translating vague duty cycles into component selections
      and quotes; throughput is constrained, creating long response times and
      lost deals.
    - >-
      Existing tools are fragmented: Excel sizing calculators, separate CAE
      packages, and generic CPQ systems don’t understand hydraulic physics or
      OEM-specific constraints, causing errors, rework, and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Performance data (efficiency, heat, noise, life) is siloed in PDFs/test
      stands; it’s hard to apply across variants or aggregate for model
      improvement, leading to conservative selections and higher BOM cost.
    - >-
      Distributors and reps struggle to self-serve; OEM customers need quick
      iterations and variant comparisons, but quote cycle times stretch to days
      or weeks.
    - >-
      Pricing discipline (discounts, FX, freight, rebates) is inconsistent;
      approvals and margin checks are manual, inconsistent, and slow.
    - >-
      Manufacturers want to expose guided selection to OEMs without revealing
      proprietary curves or internal cost structures.
  solution:
    - >-
      Interactive duty-cycle ingestion (CSV, CAN logs, test stand data) to infer
      required torque/pressure/flow over time and operating environments.
    - >-
      Physics- and data-informed sizing engine for pumps/motors (gear, vane,
      axial piston, radial piston) and accessories; optimizes for efficiency,
      thermal balance, life, cost, and noise constraints.
    - >-
      Library of validated component curves (ηv, ηm, noise, life) and derating
      factors by temperature, viscosity, altitude, contamination class.
    - >-
      Circuit-level checks: cavitation margin (NPSH/NSS), pressure ripple, heat
      rejection, reservoir and cooler sizing, duty-cycle weighted efficiency and
      losses.
    - >-
      Configuration rules engine for product families, options, and
      compatibility; safeguards against invalid BOMs; supports multi-brand
      selection when enabled.
    - >-
      CPQ layer: price books, FX, freight, rebates, approvals, discount
      guardrails, and margin leakage analytics; outputs quote PDFs, 3D/2D
      drawings, and BOMs.
    - >-
      Connectors to ERP/PLM/CRM (SAP, Oracle, Infor, Epicor, Salesforce,
      Dynamics), and e-commerce portals; versioned APIs for embedding in
      manufacturer portals.
    - >-
      White-label portals for distributors/OEMs with access control (hide cost,
      expose list/net) and application-specific product recommendations.
    - >-
      Proposal generation with performance plots, duty-cycle analytics,
      CAD-neutral models (STEP, Parasolid), and compliance notes (ISO/NFPA).
    - >-
      Feedback loop: anonymized quote outcomes and test-stand deltas to
      continually improve sizing accuracy and pricing guidance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From duty cycle to validated pump/motor configuration to a priced,
    approval-ready quote in under 60 minutes — with physics-informed accuracy,
    OEM-specific rules, and direct ERP/CPQ integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, validated dataset and hybrid model tuned with
    manufacturer test-stand data and real quote outcomes; combined with embedded
    domain constraints and enterprise-grade integrations, this creates accuracy,
    trust, and switching costs that generic CPQ or CAE tools can’t match.
