  problem:
    - >-
      Capital allocation for workovers is manual and slow: engineers spend 8–15
      hours/week in spreadsheets/Aries/ValNav to rank candidates and build AFEs;
      decisions slip 1–3 weeks, missing rig windows.
    - >-
      Prediction uncertainty: uplift from recompletions/workovers varies widely;
      without robust counterfactuals, 30–50% of executed workovers underperform
      plan, eroding IRR.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: SCADA, WellView/ProdView, accounting (P2/Quorum),
      invoices (OpenInvoice), and pricing curves sit in silos; engineers lack a
      unified view for NPV/IRR decisions.
    - >-
      AFE generation is repetitive: pulling historical costs, vendor rates, and
      activity templates takes 2–6 hours per candidate and introduces errors
      (5–10% cost overruns).
    - >-
      Volatile gas prices demand rapid reprioritization; most teams cannot
      re-rank inventory within 24 hours when price/line pressure changes,
      leading to suboptimal sequencing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Historical uplift modeling using pre/post workover time series, well
      conditions, and analogs; counterfactual production forecasts to estimate
      incremental gas and liquids.
    - >-
      Integrated economics engine: DCF with user price decks/hedges, LOE,
      downtime, water handling, gathering tariffs, taxes, and risk-adjusted cost
      libraries; outputs NPV, IRR, and payback.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware scheduling: rank and sequence by NPV/rig-day considering
      rig availability, workover duration, pad access, line pressure, and HSE
      windows.
    - >-
      AFE drafting: auto-populate scope, tasks, cost line items, vendor rates,
      contingencies; export to P2/Quorum/Enverus OpenInvoice; includes cost
      benchmarking and variance flags.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: sensitivity to gas price (+/-), downtime, success
      probability, recompletion options (perforation adds, plunger lift, tubing
      changes, compression), and multi-well pad bundling.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: track actuals vs forecast (production and cost),
      rebalance rankings weekly; model performance dashboard and bias alerts.
    - >-
      Integrations: SCADA/historian (OSIsoft PI/Aveva, Cygnet), Peloton
      WellView, P2/Quorum, Aries/ValNav, OpenInvoice; SSO and audit trails.
    - >-
      Emissions/line loss add-on: estimate methane intensity deltas from reduced
      venting/line leaks due to workover and include cost of methane fee where
      applicable.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Maximize gas workover ROI with AI-ranked candidates, validated uplift/NPV
    forecasts, and one-click AFE drafts—cut decision time by 80% and raise
    realized NPV per rig-month by 20–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop system purpose-built for workovers: uplift prediction +
    economics + constraint-aware scheduling + automated AFE drafting, all
    integrated with operator systems and validated on operator-specific data.
    Accumulating proprietary labels on workover outcomes create a defensible
    data moat and faster model improvement than generic analytics platforms.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Asset, reservoir, and production teams at natural gas operators who need to
    prioritize workover/recompletion capital toward the highest-return wells in
    Natural Gas Extraction (NAICS 211130).
  problem: >-
    External: many aging wells, volatile gas prices, finite workover crews and
    capex. Internal: manual screening is slow and biased; uplift and NPV are
    uncertain; AFE inputs are inconsistent and stall approvals. Philosophical:
    capital should flow to the best economics—not the loudest requests.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit PDP targets without overspending. Our
    domain-built AI ranks candidates using your production, SCADA, workover
    history, and cost data; models are transparent and auditable, with
    operator-validated results across major gas basins. Secure by design and
    easy to integrate with your economics tools.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: production, SCADA, well attributes, workover history,
    price/cost curves. 2) Rank and quantify: uplift, NPV, IRR, risk bands, and
    constraints; auto-generate draft AFE quantities and cost lines. 3) Review
    and export: approve the slate, export the AFE pack and schedule. Start with
    a 4–6 week pilot with clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a pilot or schedule a 30-minute demo. Transitional: request a
    sample ranking report, AFE pack, and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Faster, defensible decisions; higher NPV per dollar; more production with
    less downtime; consistent, approval-ready AFEs; better crew utilization;
    aligned asset and finance teams; a live backlog that updates with price and
    performance.
  failure: >-
    Capex continues going to low-ROI workovers; high-value candidates are
    missed; approvals stall due to incomplete AFEs; budget overruns grow;
    production is deferred; leadership and regulatory scrutiny increases.
