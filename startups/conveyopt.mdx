  problem:
    - >-
      Conveyor lines in distribution and manufacturing often run at fixed speeds
      and underutilized conditions, wasting 12–30% of energy due to lack of
      speed scheduling, poor idle/accumulation logic, and suboptimal VFD
      parameters.
    - >-
      Controls teams avoid energy-tuning because changing PLC logic risks
      throughput, safety, and warranty; there’s no simple way to test, validate,
      and roll back optimizations.
    - >-
      Most sites lack normalized measurement and verification (M&V), making it
      hard to prove savings and claim utility incentives or ESG credits.
    - >-
      VFDs are commonly misconfigured (sleep thresholds, accel/decel ramps,
      torque limits, PID gains), resulting in unnecessary kWh consumption and
      mechanical wear.
    - >-
      OEMs (NAICS 333922) seek differentiated, margin-accretive digital services
      but lack a standardized, low-risk energy optimization bundle they can ship
      with new or retrofit lines.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven speed scheduling that dynamically adjusts line and zone speeds
      by shift, order backlog, and accumulation state; includes guardrails to
      maintain target throughput and takt time.
    - >-
      Idle logic optimization for accumulation and zero-pressure zones to stop
      or sleep sections intelligently during gaps; start/stop smoothing to
      reduce wear and inrush.
    - >-
      VFD setpoint and PID tuning assistant that recommends and safely applies
      optimal accel/decel ramps, torque limits, sleep thresholds, and carrier
      pressure (if applicable), with A/B testing.
    - >-
      Throughput and safety guardrails: constraints to ensure OEE, minimum speed
      during waves, interlock adherence, and safety zoning are never violated.
    - >-
      M&V engine (IPMVP Option B/C) that normalizes for volume, shift patterns,
      ambient conditions, and product mix to verify kWh savings and produce
      auditable reports for incentives.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations: PLC function blocks for Rockwell, Siemens,
      Beckhoff; drivers for ABB/Yaskawa/Danfoss/Siemens VFDs; optional WMS/WES
      hooks (e.g., wave starts).
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud architecture with a local gateway for real-time control and
      a cloud service for model training, fleet benchmarking, and dashboards.
    - >-
      Demand-response and peak-shaving mode that temporarily derates energy use
      under utility events while preserving service levels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce conveyor energy 12–25% without throughput loss, verified. Deploy in
    days using existing PLC/VFD hardware. OEM-ready blocks, M&V built-in, and
    utility-incentive support deliver sub-12-month payback with minimal risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-validated PLC function blocks and VFD parameter libraries across major
    vendors plus a conveyor-specific M&V engine enable rapid, low-risk
    deployment and verified incentives. Growing fleet dataset provides superior
    models of kWh vs. speed/load, improving savings and robustness over
    general-purpose EMS tools.
