leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RAN operations teams face alert fatigue from millions of counters and
      static thresholds, leading to slow Mean-Time-To-Detect (MTTD) and
      Mean-Time-To-Recover (MTTR).
    - >-
      Manual parameter tuning (neighbor lists, power/tilt, handover, timers, PRB
      scheduling, QoS profiles) is error-prone, vendor/tech specific, and
      constrained by change-management policies.
    - >-
      Existing SON tools are often rule-based, vendor siloed, or lack
      explainability and safe rollout/rollback; they struggle with multi-vendor,
      4G/5G DSS, and densification/small cells.
    - >-
      Poorly detected anomalies and conservative changes drive QoE degradation
      (dropped calls, poor throughput), SLA penalties, NPS churn, and high OPEX
      (truck rolls, overtime).
    - >-
      Carriers need a closed-loop but human-governed way to detect abnormal KPIs
      per cell/cluster and recommend safe, vendor-specific parameter adjustments
      with audit-ready change tickets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest PM/CM/FM data (3GPP counters, vendor OSS exports, topology, alarms,
      traces) and build seasonal, per-cell baselines with topology-aware anomaly
      detection (unsupervised + supervised).
    - >-
      Correlate anomalies across cells/clusters/sectors to isolate likely root
      causes (e.g., HO failures post-software upgrade, neighbor misconfig,
      interference, backhaul congestion).
    - >-
      Recommend vendor-specific parameter changes (e.g., A3/A5 offsets, TTT,
      CIO, P0NominalPUSCH, RACH backoff, PRB scheduling weights, B1/B2
      thresholds, neighbor add/remove) with guardrails per vendor release.
    - >-
      Run “safe-change” simulation (digital twin) using historical distributions
      and constraints; generate expected KPI deltas and rollback plans; support
      progressive rollout (A/B, canary across 1–3% of cells).
    - >-
      Produce auditable change tickets with impact assessment and pre/post-check
      tasks; integrate with ServiceNow/JSM; optional closed-loop execution via
      OSS/NMS/SON/SMO APIs with human-in-the-loop approval.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from outcomes (accept/reject, post-change KPI deltas)
      to improve precision and adapt to seasonality, events, and new releases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect abnormal cell KPIs and recommend safe, vendor-specific RAN parameter
    adjustments with explainability, simulation, and auto-generated change
    tickets—cutting MTTD/MTTR by 30–60% and reducing manual tuning hours by
    40–70% while protecting QoE and SLAs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vendor- and release-specific parameter knowledge base with encoded safe
    ranges and interactions, coupled with a simulation-first guardrail engine
    and human-governed closed-loop workflow. Over time, outcome-driven learning
    (via federated or per-operator models) compounds precision without sharing
    raw data.

  character: >-
    RAN and Operations leaders at wireless carriers (NAICS 517112) who want a
    stable, self-healing network and fewer war rooms.
  problem: >-
    External: KPI floods, multi-vendor complexity, and drifting parameters hide
    real degradations. Internal: teams are stuck firefighting and hesitant to
    change risky settings. Philosophical: networks should spot anomalies early
    and heal safely so subscribers always get consistent service.
  guide: >-
    We understand 24/7 RAN pressure and noisy KPIs—our team includes former RAN
    engineers. The service uses explainable AI, aligns recommendations to vendor
    playbooks, and enforces guardrails and rollback to keep changes safe and
    auditable.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: securely ingest PM counters, alarms, and CM baselines from your
    RAN/ITSM. 2) Detect: learn per-cell normal and surface anomalies in near
    real time. 3) Recommend: propose vendor-specific, safe parameter adjustments
    with impact estimates. 4) Approve & ticket: one-click change tickets into
    your ITIL workflow. 5) Optional: closed-loop remediation with guardrails and
    auto-rollback.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 4-week read-only pilot to validate detections and
    recommendations. Transitional: Request the methodology brief and a sample
    change ticket pack.
  success: >-
    Fewer outages and war rooms, faster MTTR, stabilized KPIs, safer parameter
    changes across vendors, cleaner change records, improved SLA compliance and
    subscriber experience, and reduced OPEX from targeted, automated fixes.
  failure: >-
    Without it, silent degradations linger, risky manual tuning triggers
    regressions, SLA penalties and churn rise, engineers burn out in endless
    incident bridges, and change records remain incomplete and noncompliant.
