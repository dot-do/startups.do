  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8.5
    overall: 8.7
  risks:
    - Incorrect refunds or policy application

    - Up-to-date policies and macros
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-volume, bursty support demand (weather, events, app outages) drives
      long wait times and SLA breaches, harming CSAT and retention.
    - >-
      Common, repetitive intents (fare adjustments, lost & found, receipt
      requests, cancellations, promos) consume 40–70% of agent time.
    - >-
      Safety and high-risk issues (harassment, accidents) require immediate,
      error-free escalations with audit trails; manual triage is slow and
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      Multilingual customer base (riders and drivers) increases handle time and
      error rates for monolingual teams.
    - >-
      Policy enforcement (refunds, driver deactivations, promo clawbacks) is
      inconsistent across agents, causing leakage and customer frustration.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling (dispatch, payments, KYC, CCaaS) forces agents to
      swivel-chair across systems, increasing AHT.
    - >-
      Driver support differs from rider support; most off-the-shelf bots aren’t
      tuned for two-sided marketplaces.
    - >-
      Seasonality (holidays, airports, special events) makes staffing expensive
      and inefficient; overstaff or miss SLAs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Triage and routing: classify intents (rider vs driver; safety vs
      non-safety; refund eligibility) with confidence scores and route to the
      right queue or bot flow.
    - >-
      Auto-resolution for common intents: fare adjustments within policy,
      lost-item workflow, receipt resends, cancellation fee disputes, promo
      issues, ETA/status questions.
    - >-
      Agent assist: draft replies, summarize tickets, suggest next-best actions,
      and prefill forms; learn from top-agent outcomes.
    - >-
      Safety escalation: detect safety keywords and context, trigger red banners
      and on-call paging, capture structured data, and hand off in <30 seconds
      with full audit trail.
    - >-
      Omnichannel coverage: in-app chat, web, email, SMS/WhatsApp, and IVR
      deflection to digital where possible.
    - >-
      Back-office actions: integrated refunds/credits, promo reissues, account
      flags, and documentation updates through dispatch and payment connectors.
    - >-
      Analytics and policy engine: track automation rates, leakage, SLA
      adherence; simulate policy changes and guardrails before rollout.
    - >-
      Multilingual support: 20+ languages with locale-aware policy and currency
      handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vertical AI for taxi and ridesharing support that auto-triages and resolves
    40–60% of digital contacts in 90 days, escalates safety cases to a human in
    <30 seconds at 99.9% reliability, and cuts cost per contact by 40–65% while
    lifting CSAT by 8–15 points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned policy engine and prebuilt connectors to taxi/ride-hail
    dispatch and payments enable safe, automated refund and safety flows that
    horizontal CX bots lack. Accumulated labeled datasets across rider/driver
    intents and safety events create a performance moat, while compliance-ready
    audit trails and regulator-aligned runbooks reduce enterprise risk and
    accelerate procurement.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Tier-1 ride-hailing platforms (national/regional) needing scale,
      safety-grade automation, and policy enforcement.
    - >-
      Mid-market taxi fleets (50–5,000 vehicles) using dispatch platforms
      (iCabbi, Autocab, Curb, TaxiCaller, LimoAnywhere).
    - Paratransit/NEMT operators with strict SLAs and documentation needs.
    - >-
      Corporate/black car services with high CSAT expectations and premium
      service SLAs.
    - >-
      Contact-center BPOs servicing taxi/ride-hailing accounts seeking margin
      expansion via automation.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to Heads of Support/COO at ride-hailing/taxi fleets via
      targeted ABM on LinkedIn and industry lists.
    - >-
      Partnerships with dispatch platforms (iCabbi, Autocab, Curb, TaxiCaller)
      for marketplace listings and co-sell bundles.
    - >-
      CCaaS marketplaces (Zendesk, Salesforce AppExchange, Genesys AppFoundry,
      Twilio Flex) for distribution and one-click installs.
    - >-
      BPO partnerships: revenue-share automation layer to expand margins and win
      RFPs together.
    - >-
      Industry events and associations: MOVE, Transportation Alliance, TLPA,
      Taxi/Paratransit conferences; sponsor safety and CSAT tracks.

      options.
    - 'Fast rollout: API/SDK or VPC; typical go‑live under two weeks.'
  steps:
    - Connect your ticketing platform and ride data sources.
    - 'Set policies, actions, and brand tone to match your operations.'
