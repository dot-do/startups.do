  problem:
    - >-
      Uncertain, SKU-level demand causes chronic over/under-propagation,
      creating 8–20% shrink and missed sales windows.
    - >-
      Propagation lead times (6–72+ weeks) make errors costly; spreadsheets
      can’t handle cultivar-level seasonality or retailer program changes.
    - >-
      Ready dates are frequently off by 1–4 weeks due to variable growth rates
      (temperature, photoperiod, cultivar vigor), undermining ship windows and
      retailer compliance.
    - >-
      Material purchasing (liners, cuttings, seed, pots, media, fertilizer) is
      reactive; long-lead items are either short or overbought, tying up working
      capital 10–20%.
    - >-
      Capacity constraints (greenhouse benches, hoop houses, field blocks, mist
      zones) aren’t modeled against demand, causing bottlenecks, overtime, and
      idle capacity.
    - >-
      Labor scheduling for sticking, up-potting, pruning, and staging isn’t
      lined up with starts, leading to overtime spikes and inconsistent
      productivity.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP, POS orders, broker confirmations, climate
      logs, and Excel; no single system produces a SKU-week propagation plan
      with MRP and ready-date projections.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-week demand forecasting blending historical orders, customer programs,
      seasonality, weather, and trend signals.
    - >-
      Cultivar-specific growth-duration and thermal-time models that convert
      starts to ready-date projections with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Automated propagation/liner-start calendar by SKU, quantity, and location
      with labor and capacity constraints.
    - >-
      Material Requirements Planning for cuttings/seed/liners, media, pots,
      tags, and inputs with vendor lead times and safety stocks.
    - >-
      What-if planning to simulate retailer program changes, climate scenarios,
      and price/capacity trade-offs.
    - >-
      ERP and greenhouse controller integrations to sync orders, inventory, work
      orders, and environmental data.
    - >-
      Exception management with alerts for forecast deltas, late POs, capacity
      overages, and at-risk ready dates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    RootCast translates SKU-level demand into a propagation/liner-start schedule
    with material requirements and accurate ready-date projections, improving
    fill rate by 5–12 points, cutting shrink 3–7 points, and reducing rush
    purchases 30% within one season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, cultivar-aware growth-duration library combined with
    nursery-specific demand signals and closed-loop calibration from real
    production outcomes. Deep integrations with horticulture ERPs/controllers
    and supplier lead-time data enable SKU-week MRP and ready-date projections
    competitors can’t replicate quickly. Early network effects as suppliers and
    retailers share program signals that improve all customers’ forecasts.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-to-large nursery and tree growers ($2M–$200M revenue) producing
      container shrubs, trees, perennials, and specialty ornamentals.
    - >-
      Young plant/liner producers and tissue culture labs needing accurate
      order-driven start schedules.
    - >-
      Integrated growers supplying big-box retail programs and regional garden
      centers with strict ship windows.
    - >-

      lead times.
    - >-
      Forestry seedling operations and restoration nurseries planning large
      contract grows.
  channels:
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Nursery and tree production managers who want SKU-level starts timed so the
    right plants are ready the right week.
  problem: >-
    Uncertain demand and long grow lead times force costly guesswork—overstarts
    waste cuttings, space, and cash; understating demand causes stockouts and
    missed ship windows.
  guide: >-
    An AI forecasting and planting-calendar service built for horticulture that
    understands seasonality, lead times, and capacity—so growers can plan with
    confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sales history, SKU attributes, lead times, and constraints. 2)
    Review the AI demand forecast and adjust assumptions. 3) Publish a
    propagation and liner-start calendar with material requirements and
    ready-date projections; auto-refresh weekly.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot using your last 24 months of data.
  success: >-
    Higher fill rates, 10–30% less waste, smoother labor, optimized space,
    stronger margins, and plants ready on-time and on-grade.
  failure: >-
    Keep gambling with starts, tying up cash in the wrong inventory, scrambling
    labor, missing ship dates, and disappointing customers.
