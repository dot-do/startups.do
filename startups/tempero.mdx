  problem:
    - >-
      Moisture variability causes inconsistent extraction and flour quality;
      typical target moisture band ±0.5–1.0% leads to 0.2–1.0% lost extraction
      and frequent rework.
    - >-
      Manual setpoint selection (water addition and temper time) based on
      experience doesn’t adapt to changing wheat hardness, initial moisture, or
      ambient temperature/humidity, resulting in over/under-tempering.
    - >-
      Slow feedback from offline lab tests (30–90 minutes) delays corrections;
      during grade changeovers, drift can persist for hours.
    - >-
      Energy and water inefficiencies: 5–10% avoidable energy use in milling and
      5–15% excess water addition due to conservative settings.
    - >-
      Limited traceability and regulatory documentation for FSMA/GFSI audits;
      silo-to-bag recordkeeping is fragmented across PLCs, spreadsheets, and lab
      systems.
    - >-
      Existing OEM automation focuses on fixed control loops and alarms; lacks
      prescriptive, learning recommendations across wheat varieties, seasons,
      and sites.
    - >-
      High cost of pilot errors during wheat origin/blend changes; mills accept
      quality downgrades rather than risk overcorrection.
  solution:
    - >-
      Install an edge gateway that ingests inline NIR moisture/protein readings
      pre- and post-temper, grain temperature, flow rates, ambient temp/RH, and
      PLC setpoints/actuator status.
    - >-
      Model wheat hardness using lab SKCS/Brabender data and/or infer via
      NIR+process signatures; tag by lot, origin, and blend ratio.
    - >-
      Run a digital twin of temper bins to predict moisture uptake kinetics;
      recommend dynamic water addition (L/min) and temper time (h) per bin and
      blend profile.
    - >-
      Adaptive control: update recommendations every 1–5 minutes based on sensor
      feedback; optional closed-loop writes to PLC under guardrails and miller
      approval rules.
    - >-
      Grade changeover playbooks: prescriptive ramp profiles to minimize
      overshoot and achieve steady-state target moisture in <60 minutes.
    - >-
      Quality and compliance: automated batch records linking silo→bin→mill with
      moisture, time, water usage, and overrides for audit-readiness.
    - >-
      Operator UX: role-based dashboards, alarm rationalization, what-if
      scenarios, and “explainable” suggestions tied to conditions (e.g., higher
      hardness, colder grain).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase flour extraction by 0.2–0.8%, stabilize quality within ±0.2%
    moisture of target, and cut energy 3–8% through adaptive, sensor-driven
    recommendations (or closed-loop control) for water addition and tempering
    time that learn across wheat types, seasons, and sites—deployed in weeks,
    payback in 2–6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized, continuously learning tempering model trained across multiple
    geographies and wheat classes, delivered as vendor-agnostic edge software
    with proven closed-loop safety guardrails—validated by reference mills and

  character: >-
    Mill managers and process engineers who must hit moisture specs and maximize
    extraction despite variable wheat and changing ambient conditions.
  problem: >-
    - External: Inbound moisture and hardness vary; ambient RH/temperature
    shifts; rules-of-thumb for water addition and tempering time cause
    inconsistency; sensor data is underused.

    - Internal: Frustrated by guesswork, firefighting, and rework; pressure to
    meet specs and throughput without waste.

    - Philosophical: In a modern mill, water and time decisions should be
    data-driven, not left to luck.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of keeping grinders fed and QA satisfied. Our
    team blends milling science with applied ML, validated in production pilots.
    We integrate with inline moisture/hardness/NIR sensors and SCADA/MES to
    deliver secure, auditable recommendations and continuous learning.
  plan: >-
    - Assess: Review wheat streams, current tempering, sensors, and targets;
    simulate improvement potential.

    - Integrate & calibrate: Connect to inline sensors and PLC/SCADA; calibrate
    to your wheat classes and bins; train operators.

    - Optimize & learn: Real-time recommendations for water addition and
    tempering time based on initial moisture, wheat hardness, and ambient
    conditions; adapts continuously via inline sensors; weekly performance
    reviews.

    - Agreement: You keep data ownership and final control; start with a
    low-risk 4-week pilot with clear success metrics.

  problem:
    - Moisture targets drift with manual setpoints and changing wheat lots.
    - Ambient temperature/humidity swings alter absorption and dwell needs.
    - Hardness variability makes one recipe ineffective across bins and blends.
    - Lab feedback is delayed; corrections come after waste is made.
    - 'Over/under-watering hurts extraction, energy use, and uptime.'
    - Sensors aren’t connected to dosing/control—no true closed loop.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time AI calculates precise water addition and tempering time for each
      lot.
    - >-
      Uses initial moisture, wheat hardness, and ambient conditions; adapts via
      inline sensors.
    - Pushes setpoints to PLC/SCADA or provides clear operator recommendations.
    - >-
      Continuously learns from outcomes to hold moisture on-spec despite
      variability.
    - 'Dashboards, alerts, and audit-ready logs keep QA and production aligned.'
    - Fits existing tempering lines—no major retrofit required.
  features:
    - 'Inline sensor integration (moisture, NIR, temperature, flow).'
    - 'Hardness-aware models (e.g., SKCS) and wheat-class tuning.'
    - Water dosing optimizer with valve/pump control and safeguards.
    - 'Tempering time/dwell optimization by bin, blend, and ambient conditions.'

    - 'Edge + cloud architecture for low latency, reliability, and security.'
    - 'Role-based dashboards, mobile alerts, and weekly performance reports.'
  steps:
    - Connect sensors and PLCs via secure edge gateway.
    - Import baseline specs and lab data; calibrate targets.
    - Run in Assist Mode to validate recommendations with operators.
    - Enable Closed-Loop Mode to auto-adjust water and dwell time.
