  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of blowers, pumps, and mixers cause emergency bypasses
      and permit exceedances, exposing utilities to fines ($10k–$100k per event)
      and reputational risk.
    - >-
      Aging equipment and staffing shortages lead to reactive maintenance and
      overtime; crews spend 15–30% of time firefighting instead of planned
      maintenance.
    - >-
      Existing route-based vibration checks are infrequent (monthly/quarterly)
      and miss early-stage faults developing over days/weeks.
    - >-
      Data silos across SCADA/PLC, CMMS, and sensors prevent timely insights;
      creating work orders and job plans is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      OEM condition monitoring is fragmented by brand/model and doesn’t unify
      across mixed fleets or integrate tightly with CMMS workflows.
    - >-
      Utilities lack in-house data science and reliability engineering
      capabilities to build, validate, and maintain predictive models safely
      within OT constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy retrofit multi-sensor kits (vibration, current/voltage taps,
      temperature) and ingest existing SCADA/PLC tags to model asset health
      without disrupting OT.
    - >-
      Use AI/physics-informed analytics to detect bearing wear,
      imbalance/misalignment, cavitation, electrical anomalies (MCSA), and
      lubrication issues; estimate remaining useful life (RUL) with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Auto-generate prioritized CMMS work orders with OEM-specific job plans,
      parts, tools, safety lockout/tagout steps, and estimated labor hours; sync
      status bi-directionally.
    - >-
      Provide web/mobile dashboards and alerts that highlight risk, recommended
      actions, and expected impact (downtime avoided, kWh saved).
    - >-
      Run on secure edge gateways with store-and-forward and low-bandwidth
      modes; support OPC UA/DA, Modbus TCP/RTU, Ethernet/IP; optional cloud
      analytics for fleet benchmarking.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture technician feedback and work order outcomes
      to continuously improve model precision/recall per asset type.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime and compliance risk by predicting emerging
    failures 7–30 days in advance and auto-creating CMMS work orders with
    step-by-step job plans tailored to blowers, pumps, and mixers—delivering
    measurable savings in maintenance labor, parts, and energy within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary wastewater rotating equipment failure library and job plan
    templates integrated directly into leading CMMS systems, combined with edge
