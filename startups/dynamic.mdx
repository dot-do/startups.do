  title: Dynamic Incentive & Surge Watcher
  description: >-
    Monitors live demand/supply and auto-issues targeted driver incentives or
    alerts to balance coverage.
  targetUsers:
    - Fleet ops
    - Marketplace ops for smaller apps
  triggers:
    - Queue length or ETA threshold breached
    - High-value booking waiting
    - Airport flight dumps/closing time surges
  inputs:
    - Live unassigned jobs/requests
    - Active driver count by zone
    - Budget and incentive rules
    - Compliance rules for communications
  steps:
    - Detect imbalance in zones
    - Estimate marginal driver needed and ROI
    - 'Craft incentive or alert (e.g., extra bonus, priority queue)'
    - Push to eligible drivers and track uptake
    - Auto-adjust or end campaign when target met
  tools:
    - Webhooks from dispatch
    - Realtime store (Redis)
    - WhatsApp/Telegram/Twilio SMS
    - Driver app push (Firebase)
    - Simple rules engine + bandit optimization
  outputs:
    - Incentive campaign records
    - Driver notifications and acceptances
    - Fill-rate improvement report
  pricingModel:
    - Performance fee (% of incremental GMV or filled jobs)
    - Or per alert + monthly fee

    modelCapability: 7
    overall: 7.5
  risks:
    - Incentive overspend if measurement is weak
    - Driver messaging fatigue
    - Labor/regulatory restrictions on incentives
  dependencies:
    - Dispatch/live supply data
    - Messaging channels to drivers
    - Budget caps and governance
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supply–demand gaps at microzone level (airports, venues, suburbs) create
      high ETAs, surge volatility, and 10–25% higher cancellation rates;
      existing tools react late and use blanket boosts.
    - >-
      Incentive inefficiency: 25–50% of bonus spend pays drivers who would have
      driven anyway (“non-incremental spend”); operators lack causal measurement
      of lift and per-dollar ROI.
    - >-
      Slow response to exogenous shocks (events, weather, transit outages) with
      10–30 minute lag from detection to action, causing missed rides and
      customer churn.
    - >-
      Budget and compliance risk: fragmented rules across cities (wage floors,
      union/coop rules, airport concessions) lead to overspend, unfairness
      claims, or regulatory exposure.
    - >-
      Driver communications are noisy; low engagement with generic messages
      causes incentive fatigue and poor repositioning compliance.
    - >-
      Limited engineering bandwidth at regional TNCs/taxi fleets to build
      real-time forecasting, experimentation, and payout integrations
      end-to-end.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time orders, driver locations/status, ETAs, and historical
      data; fuse with events, weather, traffic, and transit signals.
    - >-
      Forecast demand and supply at 5-minute intervals on a 250–500m grid;
      compute risk-of-undercoverage and expected rider wait times per cell.
    - >-
      Estimate incentive elasticity by driver cohort/zone/time using causal
      inference and multi-armed bandits; learn which micro-offers move supply
      efficiently.
    - >-
      Auto-issue micro-incentives (e.g., “+$3 for next 2 trips in Zone A, valid
      20 min”) and targeted alerts to nearby drivers most likely to respond;
      throttle by budget/ROI.
    - >-
      Early-warning “surge watcher” triggers for upcoming spikes (10–30 min
      lead) tied to event start/exit patterns and weather shifts.
    - >-
      Budget optimizer with hard guardrails (per-market caps, fairness rotation,
      airport rules) and autopause/escalation when spend efficiency drops.
    - >-
      Embedded experimentation (A/B, geo holdouts, ghost offers) and causal lift
      measurement; report incremental trips per dollar and cost per incremental
      online minute.
    - >-
      APIs/SDKs for dispatch/driver apps to deliver offers, capture
      accept/reject, and settle payouts to driver wallets; audit logs and
      compliance center.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Autopilot for driver incentives and surge: micro-targeted offers and alerts
    that rebalance coverage in minutes, cut incentive waste by 20–40%, and
    improve ETAs 10–25%—with budget guardrails, explainability, and
    plug-and-play dispatch integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset of incentive-response across fleets and cities enabling
    superior elasticity estimates; prebuilt dispatch/payout connectors that
    reduce time-to-value to weeks; explainable RL policies with
    budget/compliance guardrails; digital-twin simulation for safe policy
    testing; enterprise security posture and regulatory rule packs per market.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Tier-2/Tier-3 ride-hailing platforms (regional/national) with
      5,000–100,000 active drivers and >50k monthly trips per city (economic
      buyer: COO/Head of Supply/Marketplace).
    - >-
      Taxi fleets/co-ops using modern dispatch (200–5,000 drivers) seeking lower
      ETAs and higher trip fill rates (economic buyer: Fleet GM/Operations
      Director).
