  problem:
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets and experience to sequence pre-expansion,
      aging silos, molding/extrusion, cutting, and packing, leading to
      suboptimal schedules and expensive firefighting.
    - >-
      Steam/energy is a binding constraint; uncontrolled peaks cause pressure
      drops, idle time, and demand charges.
    - >-
      Frequent density/bead-type changeovers and mold/tool swaps add lost time
      and scrap; sequences are not optimized for minimal transitions.
    - >-
      Aging silo occupancy is mismanaged, causing waiting time for under-aged
      beads or inventory build-up of over-aged material.
    - >-
      Start-up and restart profiles are not modeled, driving excessive scrap and
      energy at extruders and block molds.
    - >-
      Inaccurate cycle-time estimates (humidity/temp-dependent) result in
      schedule slippage, late orders, and overtime.
    - >-
      No unified view of cross-stage WIP; local optimizations at each stage
      cause global inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Limited scenario planning when a boiler goes down, a rush order arrives,
      or tariffs change.
    - >-
      Sustainability targets (kWh/kg, CO2e) not embedded in daily planning,
      making ESG reporting reactive.
    - >-
      Existing APS/MES tools lack EPS/XPS-specific constraints (steam curves,
      bead moisture, density switching penalties, cutting pattern yields).
  solution:
    - >-
      Digital twin of the plant across pre-expansion, aging, molding/extrusion,
      cutting, and packing with shared constraints (boiler/steam header, labor,
      molds, silos, warehousing).
    - >-
      Hybrid optimizer (MILP/CP-SAT + heuristics) that minimizes total cost:
      energy (kWh, steam peaks), changeovers, overtime, and lateness while
      respecting product recipes, aging windows, and resource calendars.
    - >-
      Predictive cycle-time models (humidity/temperature/grade aware) update
      takt times and steam demand curves.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate rush orders, boiler derates, tariff changes;
      compare plan cost, OTIF, energy, and stability.
    - >-
      Closed-loop rescheduling using live signals (OPC UA/PLC, MES, energy
      meters) with configurable freeze windows for shop-floor stability.
    - >-
      Operator dispatching: structured start-up sequences, mold/tool prep, and
      cutting patterns with digital work orders.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit: OTIF, schedule adherence, changeover loss, scrap at start-up,
      kWh/kg or kWh/m³, steam peak demand, CO2e/order.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and production planners at EPS/XPS plants who must turn volatile
    orders into reliable, cost- and energy-aware schedules across pre-expansion,
    aging, molding/extrusion, cutting, and packing.
  problem: >-
    External: Multi-stage constraints, steam/boiler limits, bead grades and
    aging windows, and frequent changeovers make manual scheduling fragile and
    slow. Internal: Planners are stuck firefighting late orders, overtime, and
    unstable steam loads. Philosophical: Hitting OTIF and energy goals shouldn’t
    require guesswork or waste.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam-line realities—pre-expander curves, aging bins, bead
    consumption, mold/tooling calendars, extrusion rates, cutting patterns, and
    steam networks. Our AI scheduling service combines domain models with
    optimization to produce feasible, auditable plans. Secure integration, clear
    assumptions, and support build trust from day one.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES/maintenance/energy data. 2) Calibrate a digital twin with
    constraints (steam, aging windows, changeovers, shift/maintenance). 3) Run
    optimizer and what‑if scenarios to balance OTIF, cost, energy, and
    changeovers. 4) Go live with a daily finite‑capacity schedule, operator
    cockpit, and APIs. Agreement: shared KPIs, data privacy, and staged rollout
    checkpoints.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a 4‑week pilot with your recent orders and
    constraints. Transitional: Request the readiness checklist and a sample
    schedule on your data.
  success: >-
    Reliable OTIF, smoother steam load and lower energy cost exposure, fewer
    changeovers and re-runs, higher line utilization, less overtime and scrap,
    clear what‑if visibility, and confident planners with schedules everyone can
    follow.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting—missed due dates, overtime and rush energy costs,
    steam spikes, excess WIP, idle presses, last‑minute changeovers, and eroding
    customer trust.
