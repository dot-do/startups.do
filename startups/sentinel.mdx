  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection of welds and coatings is highly variable (R&R
      studies often >30% contribution to variance), causing inconsistent
      accept/reject decisions and quality escapes.
    - >-
      Late defect discovery (after sub-assembly or paint) drives rework and
      schedule risk; typical NCR cycle time is 2–10 days and costs $500–$2,000
      per occurrence, with line stops on critical defects.
    - >-
      Inspectors lack objective, spec-linked measurements (leg length, throat
      size, undercut depth, coating coverage/holidays); documentation is often
      photo-only without calibrated evidence.
    - >-
      WPS and paint spec compliance is difficult to enforce at scale; inspectors
      must recall numerous WPS variants and MIL/AMPP coating rules under time
      pressure.
    - >-
      Defense programs require stringent traceability (ITAR/CMMC/AS9100/ISO
      9001); current image capture lacks secure metadata (WPS ID, operator ID,
      heat/lot, part serial).
    - >-
      Training new inspectors is slow; tribal knowledge and subjective calls
      lead to elevated false rejects/accepts during workforce turnover.
    - >-
      Existing fixed-station vision or NDT solutions are costly, inflexible for
      large armored structures, and do not quantify visible geometry/coverage
      from ad-hoc shop-floor images.
    - >-
      Suppliers struggle to provide objective evidence for PPAP/FAI and contract
      audits; primes spend time revalidating supplier welds and coatings.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided capture app (rugged mobile or fixed camera) with WPS/paint spec
      lookup, on-screen framing guides, and reference scale/lighting prompts to
      achieve repeatable imagery.
    - >-
      AI measurement of weld bead geometry (fillet leg lengths L1/L2, effective
      throat, cap width/height, convexity/concavity, undercut length/depth,
      overlap, porosity count/size, spatter) with ±0.5 mm target MAE (95% CI)
      when using the provided calibration target and lighting.
    - >-
      Coating coverage analysis for CARC: percent coverage, holidays/pinholes,
      runs/sags, dry-spray/orange peel classification; optional UV tracer
      support; BLE integration with DFT gauges (DeFelsko/Elcometer) to fuse film
      thickness data with image coverage.
    - >-
      Automated pass/fail versus WPS/paint spec tolerances, with confidence
      scores; instant operator feedback and escalation workflow.
    - >-
      Auto-generated NCRs containing annotated images, measured values vs
      limits, referenced WPS/paint spec paragraphs, location on 3D model or 2D
      drawing zone, and operator/time/part traceability.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to MES/PLM/QMS (SAP, Teamcenter, Windchill, ETQ,
      MasterControl) to push results, link to work orders, and close-loop
      corrective actions.
    - >-
      Defense-compliant deployment: on-prem air-gapped edge inference (NVIDIA
      Jetson Orin or x86 GPU), optional AWS GovCloud/Azure Government; ITAR data
      handling, encryption, detailed audit logs.
    - >-
      Validation toolkit: MSA (Gage R&R) workflows, uncertainty budgets, and
      calibration artifacts to document objective measurement capability for
      auditors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-real-time, spec-verified weld and coating inspections from any
    shop-floor image—quantified against WPS and CARC/AMPP specs, auto-generating
    NCRs with calibrated evidence—deployed securely on-prem/GovCloud for ITAR
    and CMMC compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Defense-specific labeled datasets tied to WPS and CARC/AMPP rules; validated
    measurement capability (documented uncertainty and Gage R&R) acceptable to
    defense auditors; turnkey, air-gapped edge deployment with secure evidence
    packaging and automated NCR workflows that general-purpose vision platforms
