leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High false positives: Rules-based fraud filters overload SIU with 60–90%
      non-actionable referrals, wasting investigator time and increasing LAE.
    - >-
      Limited signal integration: Claims, policy, external data (ISO
      ClaimSearch, public records), telematics, repair shop data, and adjuster
      notes are siloed, obscuring patterns and networks.
    - >-
      Slow, manual triage: Investigators spend hours per case assembling facts;
      average triage cycle adds 1–3 days to claim resolution and increases
      indemnity leakage.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability and auditability: Existing scores lack clear
      rationale and traceable evidence, complicating model governance, regulator
      reviews, and internal approvals.
    - >-
      Knowledge not scalable: Best-practice tactics live with senior SIU staff;
      as turnover occurs, investigative quality and consistency vary.
    - >-
      Model degradation: Static models drift with new fraud typologies (e.g.,
      staged collisions, assignment of benefits abuse, vendor collusion),
      reducing lift over time.
    - >-
      Integration friction: Deployments into core claims systems take months,
      delaying ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time fraud risk scoring at FNOL and pre-payment, combining rules,
      supervised models, graph features, and NLP on adjuster notes.
    - >-
      Explainable rationale: human-readable reason codes, feature contributions,
      document citations, and evidence snapshots for each score.
    - >-
      Network link analysis: graph of claimants, vehicles, addresses, providers,
      repair shops, attorneys; community risk scoring and collusion indicators.
    - >-
      Next-best action engine: recommends targeted steps (e.g., request EUO, SIU
      referral, specific document, provider query) with estimated impact and
      effort.
    - >-
      Triage queue orchestration: rank-order claims, configurable thresholds per
      line/state, and auto-routing to SIU or special handling.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: quick-approve/override flows to capture feedback
      and continuously improve models.
    - >-
      Model governance suite: versioning, bias checks, drift monitoring,
      challenger models, and auditable decision logs.
    - >-
      Integrations: APIs and connectors for Guidewire/Duck Creek/Sapiens, ISO
      ClaimSearch, identity/residency data, telematics, and document/notes
      ingestion.
    - >-
      Dashboards & ROI tracking: precision/recall, hit rate, savings, cycle
      time, investigator productivity; A/B experiments and cohort analysis.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce LAE and indemnity leakage by prioritizing the right claims and
    guiding investigators with explainable AI. Sentinel provides a fraud risk
    score with evidence-backed rationale, network link analysis across entities,
    and next-best investigative actions—integrated into your claims workflow in
    60–90 days, with audit-ready transparency and carrier-specific calibration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A carrier-calibrated hybrid model stack that fuses structured claim
    features, unstructured notes/documents, and graph signals—combined with an
    explainability library mapped to SIU playbooks. Accelerators for top claims
    cores cut time-to-value to 60–90 days. Optional privacy-preserving learning
    (federated updates or hashed identifiers) enables cross-carrier typology
    updates without sharing raw PII, sustaining lift against evolving fraud
    rings.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Claims executives, SIU directors, and fraud analysts at Other Direct
    Insurance (except Life, Health, and Medical) carriers who need fast,
    accurate fraud triage and investigator-ready insights.
  problem: >-
    Fraud is rising while claim volumes and data sources explode. Manual triage
    causes false positives, overwhelms SIU, and lets bad actors slip through.
    Honest policyholders pay for fraud, and carriers face audit and compliance
    pressure.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to cut leakage without slowing clean claims. Our
    explainable AI scores each claim, surfaces rationale and network links, and
    fits existing SIU workflows. With strong security and governance, it
    delivers transparent, regulator-ready decisions your teams can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect claims, policy, payment, and third-party data via secure APIs; 2)
    Calibrate models to your book, rules, and red flags; 3) Score and
    auto-triage claims with explainable reasons; 4) Guide SIU with network maps
    and next best investigative actions; 5) Close the loop with investigator
    feedback to continuously improve; 6) Roll out dashboards, alerts, and
    governance checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Request a
    sample scorecard, methodology brief, and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    SIU focuses on the highest-risk cases, cycle times shrink, leakage and LAE
    decline, approval rates for clean claims rise, and you gain a defensible,
    auditable fraud program that protects honest policyholders.
  failure: >-
    Without this, fraud leakage grows, investigators chase low-yield leads,
    customer friction increases from blanket holds, and regulatory or audit
    scrutiny becomes more likely.
