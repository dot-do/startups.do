  problem:
    - >-
      Early-phase unit/space layouts are slow and costly: typical floors or TI
      test-fits can take 8–24 hours per iteration by a PA/Designer with multiple
      rework cycles.
    - >-
      Manual layout work risks missed code issues (egress, occupancy, corridor
      widths, ADA clearances), causing redesign and schedule slips.
    - >-
      Clients demand many options quickly (yield studies, adjacencies, daylight
      access, unit-mix mixes), which overwhelms teams and compresses fees.
    - >-
      Jurisdictional code variance (IBC/IFC/ADA/local amendments) makes
      consistent compliance checking and documentation hard at speed.
    - >-
      Hand-offs from test-fit to BIM are error-prone; re-modeling in Revit
      introduces inefficiency and loss of design intent.
    - >-
      Design technology investments (Dynamo/Grasshopper scripts) are bespoke,
      fragile, and require in-house experts to maintain.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based, code-aware layout generator that converts program briefs
      (areas, adjacencies, unit mix, target efficiency) into multiple feasible
      floor plans.
    - >-
      Built-in compliance heuristics and calculators (egress travel distances,
      exit counts, corridor widths, occupancy loads, restroom counts, ADA
      clearances) with citations to sections (eg, IBC/ADA) and adjustable local
      amendments.
    - >-
      Daylight and view scoring (window proximity, orientation, obstruction) and
      optimization objectives that balance efficiency, daylight, adjacency, and
      structure alignment.
    - >-
      Structural and building core awareness (grid, columns, shafts, stairs,
      elevators, wet stacks) with customizable no-go zones.
    - >-
      Export to Revit (Rooms, walls, doors, tags, schedules) and
      Rhino/Grasshopper; round-trip edits preserve constraints.
    - >-
      Scenario management: generate and compare 3–10 options with KPIs
      (efficiency, NRSF/RSF, daylight %, unit mix, code flags) and
      cost/constructability proxies.
    - >-
      Reproducible audit package (PDF) with assumptions, code checks, and plan
      annotations for internal QA and client briefing.
    - API for embedding into developer/owner portals or internal firm tools.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate code-aware, daylight-optimized typical floor and TI layouts from a
    brief to a Revit-ready plan in under 5 minutes, with transparent compliance
    checks and side-by-side scenario comparisons—cutting iteration time by
    70–90% and reducing rework risk.

  character: >-
    Architects, interiors teams, and developers who need fast, code-aware
    unit/room layouts for typical floors and tenant improvements that honor
    adjacencies and daylight.
  problem: >-
    Deadlines are tight, codes and egress are complex, and manual iteration is
    slow; errors lead to rework, missed daylight/adjacency goals, and lost fees.
  guide: >-
    We are architecture-trained AI builders who understand submittal pressure
    and encode code rules, adjacency logic, egress/accessibility needs, and
    daylight guidance into a fast, trustworthy generator.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload floor plate, cores, and requirements (unit mix, adjacencies, code
    presets). 2) Generate multiple code-aware options with daylight and
    adjacency scoring. 3) Pin and adjust to refine, then export to Revit/CAD for
    coordination.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot on your next typical floor.
  success: >-
    Deliver compliant, daylight-optimized layouts in hours; win proposals;
    de-risk approvals; keep design intent; and export cleanly to Revit/CAD so
    teams focus on higher-value design.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning weeks on redlines, miss code checks, slip schedules, absorb
    costly redesigns, and lose bids to faster teams.
