  problem:
    - >-
      Growers of cereals and oilseeds face high and volatile N fertilizer costs
      and tightening regulations (e.g., EU Nitrates Directive) but lack
      in-field, mid-season tools to allocate N precisely by zone.
    - >-
      Static blanket rates or simple flat topdress strategies ignore spatial
      variability in soil N supply and crop demand, leading to 8–20% wasted N
      and/or yield penalties in N-limited zones.
    - >-
      Current VRA tools are fragmented: many rely solely on canopy indices
      without a crop N balance, or they don’t output equipment-ready
      prescriptions across mixed fleets (John Deere, Trimble, AgLeader, Raven).
    - >-
      Adoption friction: complex data wrangling (soil tests, historic yield,
      imagery), uncertain ROI, and no clear compliance documentation deter use.
    - >-
      Limited ground-truth validation and lack of on-farm trial workflows make
      it hard for agronomists to prove value to growers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingest: field boundaries, previous N/applied logs, soil mineral N/OM,
      manure credits, historic yield maps, crop/variety, sowing date, and
      management zones.
    - >-
      Remote sensing + phenology: frequent Sentinel-2/Planet NDVI/NDRE with
      growth stage detection (BBCH/Feekes) to time recommendations and normalize
      indices across fields and dates.
    - >-
      N balance engine: estimate crop N requirement (by crop, target yield,
      variety), soil N supply (soil tests, mineralization from weather/soil
      texture/OM), and residual N; account for losses (leaching/denitrification
      risk) using recent weather and soil drainage class.
    - >-
      Canopy-sensing adjustment: adjust zone-level N rates based on normalized
      canopy status vs. expected growth curve, constrained by min/max rate and
      equipment capabilities; includes smoothing and headland logic.
    - >-
      Output: equipment-ready VRA prescriptions (ISO-XML, shapefile, John Deere
      Ops Center, Trimble, Raven, AgLeader) with legends and operator notes;
      includes ROI preview and optional on-rig sensor linkage (e.g.,
      GreenSeeker) for last-meter refinement.
    - >-
      Validation & learning: create A/B test strips automatically; compare yield
      monitor data post-harvest; update field-specific response curves for next
      season.
    - >-
      Compliance: generate auditable N-plan and as-applied report for
      record-keeping and regulatory inspections.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase nitrogen use efficiency and profit per hectare with a calibrated
    N-balance plus canopy-sensing engine that generates equipment-ready VRA
    prescriptions, validated by on-farm trials and accompanied by
    regulatory-ready documentation—fast, simple, and compatible across mixed
    fleets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated, multi-crop (cereals + oilseeds) N-balance plus canopy engine
    trained on paired datasets of SMN tests, multi-sensor imagery, and yield
    responses, combined with deep OEM prescription compatibility and an embedded
    on-farm trial workflow that converts local proof into scalable adoption.
    Competitors often offer either canopy-only tools or crop models without
    strong VRA execution and validation.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Oilseed and grain combination farmers and agronomists who want confident,
    profitable nitrogen side‑dress/topdress decisions across variable fields.
  problem: >-
    - External: Variable soils, weather, and crop canopies make flat‑rate N
    wasteful and risky for side‑dress/topdress.

    - Internal: Tired of guessing N rates and worrying about yield/protein loss
    or wasted spend.

    - Philosophical: Every acre deserves precise, data‑driven nitrogen that pays
    and protects land and water.

    - Villain: Rules‑of‑thumb and blanket rates that ignore in‑season crop need.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pressure of timing and right‑sizing N across mixed
    rotations and unpredictable weather.

    - Authority: AI engine that blends N‑balance accounting with canopy‑sensing
    adjustments (NDVI/NDRE), field‑tested with agronomist controls, integrates
    with common monitors and VRA hardware.
  plan: >-
    - Process:
      1) Connect fields and sensors: import soil tests, planting data, prior N, yield maps, and in‑season imagery/canopy data.
      2) Analyze: compute current N balance, adjust by canopy vigor, simulate response by zone.
      3) Decide: review rate maps, set constraints and safety margins, approve.
      4) Apply: export VRA prescriptions (ISO‑XML/Shapefile) for spreaders/sprayers; monitor outcomes.
    - Agreement: You own the data, transparent assumptions, agronomist overrides
    respected, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a pilot on 2–3 fields and receive your first VRA
    prescriptions within 24 hours.

    - Transitional: Book a 20‑minute demo, run the ROI calculator, and download
    sample maps.
  success: |-
    - Hit yield and protein targets more consistently.
    - Lower N cost per bushel and reduce unnecessary passes.
    - Document reduced leaching and N2O risk for compliance or incentives.
    - Less stress and more predictable margins across mixed crops and fields.
  failure: |-
    - Keep over/under‑applying, wasting N and missing yield/protein targets.
    - Increased risk of lodging, leaching, and regulatory pain.
    - Another season of guesswork instead of clarity and ROI.
