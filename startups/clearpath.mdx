  problem:
    - >-
      Independent outdoor power equipment (OPE) dealers carry 12–25% of
      inventory aged >180 days, tying up $75k–$300k in working capital per
      location.
    - >-
      Manual markdowns and promotions are ad-hoc; staff lack data-driven price
      ladders and bundling tactics, leading to inconsistent sell-through and
      margin erosion.
    - >-
      MAP policy complexity across OEMs (e.g., STIHL, Husqvarna, Toro, Echo)
      creates fear of penalties and slows decision-making; dealers
      under-discount or miss promo windows.
    - >-
      Online price/POS updates are error-prone and fragmented across systems
      (POS, e-comm, marketplaces), causing MAP violations, channel mismatches,
      and lost sales.
    - >-
      Seasonality/weather swings (spring surges, late winters, droughts) aren’t
      reflected in store-level pricing, causing stockouts on fast movers and
      dead stock on slow movers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Slow-mover detection: Identify SKUs with low sell-through, high weeks of
      supply (WOS), and aging thresholds (e.g., >90, >180, >270 days).
    - >-
      MAP-aware price laddering: Recommend staged markdowns (e.g., 10%/20%/30%)
      with floor constraints: MAP, cost+X%, target margin, and local
      regulations.
    - >-
      Bundle builder: Suggest SKU bundles that pair overstock core units with
      attachments (trimmers, batteries, chains, PPE) to boost attachment rate
      and blended margins.
    - >-
      Promo calendar: Weather- and season-aware scheduling (pre-season,
      mid-season, end-of-season) with OEM promo ingestion; generate signage and
      online assets.
    - >-
      Autopilot sync: One-click approvals push new prices/promos to POS and
      e-comm; verify write success and monitor for MAP violations.
    - >-
      A/B test and analytics: Compare promo tactics (bundle vs. markdown), track
      clearance velocity, GMROI uplift, and markdown efficiency.
    - >-
      Guardrails & audit: Full change history, role-based approvals, OEM MAP
      documentation storage; alerts for compliance risks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Free up cash and clear aging inventory 20–40% faster with MAP-compliant,
    AI-driven price ladders, bundles, and promotions—synced automatically to POS
    and online with measurable ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    OPE-specialized pricing models and MAP policy engine tuned to category

  character: >-
    Outdoor Power Equipment retailers (NAICS 444230) who need to move aging
    inventory profitably while staying MAP compliant across POS and online
    channels.
  problem: >-
    External - slow movers tie up cash and floor space; MAP and multi channel
    pricing make markdowns risky and slow. Internal - owners worry about missing
    seasons and eroding margins. Philosophical - clearing inventory should not
    require guesswork or compliance risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand dealer constraints, OEM policies, and seasonal demand. Our MAP
    aware AI and retail pricing playbooks help OPE dealers make confident,
    compliant price moves across POS and ecommerce.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your POS and ecommerce; import inventory, sales, and vendor
    policy data. 2) AI flags aging SKUs and proposes compliant price changes,
    bundles, and promos with guardrails you set. 3) Approve and publish; prices
    sync to POS and online while performance is monitored and tuned.
  callToAction: Book a 20 minute demo or request a free aging inventory scan.
  success: >-
    Free up cash, reduce days on hand, clear last season models before
    changeovers, stay MAP compliant, protect margins, and streamline pricing
    workflows.
  failure: >-
    Cash stays trapped in stale stock, carrying costs rise, discounting happens
    too late or violates MAP, and last season models gather dust while new
    arrivals crowd the floor.
