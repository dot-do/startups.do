  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier feeds are inconsistent (CSV, XML, EDI, PDFs), incomplete, and
      change frequently—resulting in 10–15 minutes of manual work per SKU for
      independents and 3–5 minutes for mid-market teams.
    - >-
      Critical toy/game attributes (age grading, piece count, language/edition,
      battery/magnet presence, safety testing references) are often
      missing—leading to 10–20% marketplace disapprovals and elevated return
      rates.
    - >-
      Compliance requirements (CPSIA, EN71, CA Prop 65, button cell batteries,
      small parts/choking hazards, magnets) are complex and dynamic;
      non-compliance risks account suspensions and fines.
    - >-
      Images are often non-compliant (no white background, wrong aspect ratio,
      low resolution, packaging-only) causing listing rejection or low
      conversion; retailers lack the tooling to fix at scale.
    - >-
      SEO metadata and titles are not optimized for long-tail search (e.g.,
      “co-op legacy board game 2–4 players”), resulting in low organic
      discoverability and 10–30% lower click-through rates than category
      benchmarks.
    - >-
      Variant grouping (editions, languages, colors, expansions) and UPC/GTIN
      deduplication are error-prone—creating duplicate listings and poor
      customer experience.
    - >-
      New release/preorder workflows and street-date compliance are
      manual—causing missed revenue windows and MAP violations.
    - >-
      Retailers lack a unified pipeline to normalize multi-supplier data, detect
      conflicts, and syndicate channel-specific requirements (Amazon, Walmart,
      eBay, Shopify/Google Merchant Center) with monitoring and alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Zero-code connectors for top distributors and platforms (Alliance,
      Asmodee, ACD, GTS; Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Magento; EDI via
      SPS/TrueCommerce; CSV/XML/PDF ingest).
    - >-
      AI normalization and attribute extraction trained on toy/game taxonomy:
      age range, player count, playtime, complexity, piece count, materials,
      language/edition, expansion/base set linking, country of origin,
      license/IP, GTIN/UPC, brand/manufacturer, dimensions/weight.
    - >-
      Compliance engine: auto-detects required warnings (CPSIA small parts,
      magnets, button cells, choking hazards, Prop 65), assigns EN71/CPSIA
      flags, generates marketplace-compliant warning text and attributes, and
      prevents risky claims.
    - >-
      SEO and content generation: keyword-optimized titles, bullets,
      descriptions, meta tags, alt text; Google Product Category mapping;
      structured data (schema.org/Product); channel-specific templates for
      Amazon/eBay/Walmart/Google.
    - >-
      Image pipeline: background removal, centering, 1000–2000px square crops,
      sRGB, white background compliance; packaging vs product image
      classification; lifestyle composites and alt text; variant swatch
      generation.
    - >-
      SKU deduplication and canonicalization using UPC/GTIN/brand+MPN, fuzzy
      matching, and cluster rules; variant grouping; bundle/kit suggestions and
      expansion-to-base linking.
    - >-
      Syndication and monitoring: push to channels with health dashboards (GMC
      disapprovals, Amazon listing quality flags), auto-fix suggestions, alerts
      to Slack/Email; street-date and MAP policy checks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA with audit trails, approval workflows, and A/B
      testing framework for titles/images; rollback/versioning and supplier
      update diffing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy supplier feeds into compliant, SEO-rich, marketplace-ready
    listings for toys, games, and hobby in minutes—cut time-to-list by 90%,
    reduce disapprovals by 80%, and lift conversion 10–25%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specialized taxonomy and compliance engine for toys/games, prebuilt
    distributor connectors, and a growing proprietary mapping graph that links
    expansions, editions, languages, and variants across suppliers—enhanced by
    human-in-the-loop QA and A/B-tested content patterns that consistently raise
    CTR/CVR. Network effects strengthen as more retailers and distributors join,
    improving dedup accuracy and enrichment quality.
