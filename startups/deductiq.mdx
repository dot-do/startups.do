  problem:
    - >-
      Manual categorization costs 30–90 minutes per Sch C/E/F client and spikes
      to 2–3 hours for high-volume accounts, choking capacity in Jan–Apr.
    - >-
      Inconsistent mapping from book categories (QBO/Xero) to IRS line items
      causes rework and review notes, increasing errors and write-downs.
    - >-
      Missed deductions (subscriptions, professional fees, home office, mileage,
      mixed-use utilities) reduce client refunds and create client churn risk.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (bank/credit card statements, PayPal/Square, GL exports)
      requires consolidating CSVs and cleaning, adding non-billable time.
    - >-
      Limited audit trail: many firms lack evidentiary links for deductions
      claimed, increasing E&O risk and time to respond to notices.
    - >-
      Seasonal hiring and training of juniors on categorization is expensive and
      error-prone, with steep learning curves for niche areas (farms/rentals).
    - >-
      Existing bank rules and generic AI are not tax-specific; they optimize
      bookkeeping, not IRS line-item accuracy and defensibility.
    - >-
      Exports to tax software (Lacerte/UltraTax/Drake/CCH) require custom
      spreadsheets and manual mapping, leading to import errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect client bank/credit card/PSP feeds (Plaid/Finicity/MX) or upload
      CSV/GL exports (QBO, Xero, Wave, Sage).
    - >-
      Normalize and de-duplicate transactions; enrich with merchant data and
      vendor taxonomy.
    - >-
      AI models map to tax-specific categories and IRS line items (Sch C/E/F)
      with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Missed-deduction discovery engine flags likely deductible items and common
      oversights (fees, subscriptions, mixed-use).
    - >-
      Reviewer UI batches low-confidence items; one-click rules to harden firm
      policy and client-specific nuances.
    - >-
      Client Q&A mini-portal requests clarifications on ambiguous transactions;
      auto-suggests default tax treatments.
    - >-
      Generate audit-ready workpapers: categorized transaction list, adjustments
      log, documentation links, and justification notes.
    - >-
      Export import-ready summaries to major tax suites (Lacerte, UltraTax,
      Drake, CCH Axcess, ProConnect), plus Excel/CSV templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy bank and ledger data into audit-ready, importable Sch C/E/F
    summaries in minutes—auto-categorize 80–90% of transactions at ≥97%
    precision, surface 3–5% incremental deductions, and cut prep time 50–70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Tax-specific models trained on labeled data mapped to IRS Sch C/E/F, plus
    deep export integrations to major tax suites and an audit-ready workflow
    that reduces E&O exposure—hard for generic bookkeeping tools to replicate.
    SOC 2 + FTC Safeguards alignment builds trust with regulated tax firms.
