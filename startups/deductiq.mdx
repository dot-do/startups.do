leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High volume and fragmentation of customer deductions (shortage, pricing,
      promo/billback, damages, returns) across EDI 820/812, emails, PDFs, and
      portals lead to 15–45 days average resolution time.
    - >-
      Manual classification and validation cause high processing costs ($35–$75
      per deduction) and inconsistency; typical mid-to-large wholesalers process
      5,000–50,000 deductions/month.
    - >-
      Limited linkage between promotions/contracts, shipments/POD, invoices, and
      receiving data creates low dispute win rates (often <40%) and excessive
      write-offs (0.3–0.6% of sales).
    - >-
      Cash is trapped in unresolved deductions; A/R DDO for deductions often >25
      days, inflating DSO and working capital needs.
    - >-
      Analyst capacity is constrained; 10–25 FTEs are typically required for a
      $1B wholesaler’s deduction workload, with high turnover and training
      overhead.
    - >-
      Lack of audit trails and SOX-ready evidence packages increases compliance
      risk and rework.
    - >-
      Cross-functional communication gaps (Sales, Trade, AR, Logistics, Pricing)
      delay root-cause fixes and repeat issues.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingestion of remittances, debit memos, portals, and emails (EDI
      820/812, PDFs, images) with high-accuracy extraction and normalization to
      your customer and item masters.
    - >-
      Reason-code classification tailored to grocery wholesale (shortage/OS&D,
      cost/pricing, promo/billback, scan allowances, returns/damages, freight,
      compliance) with human-in-the-loop thresholds.
    - >-
      Contract and promo validation: Auto-match deductions to promotion
      calendars, billbacks, scan programs, and trade agreements; price/allowance
      variance checks against ERP/TPM systems.
    - >-
      Shipment/receiving validation: Match to PO/ASN (850/856), invoice (810),
      BOL/POD, and WMS/receiving data to confirm shortages and damages.
    - >-
      Dispute packet creation: Auto-generate evidence bundles (invoices,
      BOL/POD, price agreements, promo approvals, claim forms) and submit via
      retailer/customer portals or email with tracking.
    - >-
      Workflow and queueing: Prioritize by dollar value, recovery likelihood,
      aging; route to analysts; SLA timers; approvals and audit trails.
    - >-
      Supplier pass-through: When valid, generate supplier chargebacks/claims
      seamlessly with supporting evidence.
    - >-
      Analytics and RCA: Deductions heat maps by customer, item, lane, reason;
      repeat offender alerts; policy tuning recommendations.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: Role-based access, SOC 2 controls, PII
      minimization, full audit logs, and exportable evidence for external audit.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover more cash, faster: AI that classifies, validates, and resolves
    grocery wholesale deductions end-to-end, generating SOX-compliant dispute
    packets and automating submissions—reducing cycle time 50–70%, increasing
    win rate 10–25 points, and cutting processing cost per deduction by 40–60%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized dataset and rules library for grocery wholesale
    deductions, combined with pre-built ERP/EDI/portal integrations and dispute
    templates that compress time-to-value to weeks. Closed-loop learning from
    recovered disputes continuously raises win rates, creating a data moat that
    generic AR tools lack.
