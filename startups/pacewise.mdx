  problem:
    - >-
      Builders must maintain a target sales pace (typically 3–6 net sales per
      community per month) without eroding gross margin, yet pricing and
      incentives are often set manually and updated infrequently.
    - >-
      Mortgage rate volatility and local demand shifts create rapid changes in
      price elasticity that most builders cannot measure or react to weekly.
    - >-
      Incentives are frequently blanket or ad hoc (e.g., across-the-board
      buydowns/closing credits), causing margin leakage and inconsistent
      community-to-community performance.
    - >-
      Data needed for pricing (traffic, leads, appointments, contracts, cancels,
      incentives, competitor pricing, spec aging, construction status, MLS
      activity, rate buydown costs) is siloed across CRM, website analytics,
      ERP, lender, listing portals, and field reports.
    - >-
      Aged spec inventory (>120 days) and missed release timing increase
      carrying costs (interest, taxes, HOAs, maintenance) and tie up working
      capital.
    - >-
      Sales team discretion often results in unapproved concessions and
      inconsistent price realization vs. list price.
    - >-
      Division leaders lack weekly forecast accuracy for net sales, backlog
      conversion, and incentive spend, impairing cash planning and starts
      cadence.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly dynamic pricing recommendations at the plan/lot level using
      community-specific elasticity estimates and demand signals.
    - >-
      Incentive optimization engine: chooses the lowest-cost incentive mix
      (e.g., rate buydown points, closing cost credits, design center credits,
      lot premiums) that meets pace and margin targets under lender and policy
      constraints.
    - >-
      Guardrails and policy engine: enforce minimum gross margin %, price
      floors/ceilings, max discount %, approval thresholds, and
      brand/positioning rules.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate outcomes for rate moves (±50–100 bps),
      inventory releases, marketing spend changes, or competitor price moves;
      run A/B tests by community or plan.
    - >-
      Early-warning dashboard: funnel diagnostics (traffic → appointment →
      contract), absorption vs. target, spec aging, cancellation risk, and
      price-realization variance.
    - >-
      One-click publishing and integrations: push approved changes to
      website/CMS, MLS syndication, CRM pricing, and sales agent tools with full
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Financial impact tracking: quantify incremental margin dollars, incentive
      ROI, and carrying-cost savings vs. control communities or pre-period
      baselines.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit your target sales pace without sacrificing margin. Weekly, lot- and
    plan-level AI recommendations optimize base price and incentives under
    explicit margin and pace guardrails—with measurable ROI, auditability, and
    fast rollout.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Community/plan-level elasticity library and anonymized benchmarks across
    multiple builders and markets, enabling faster cold start and more accurate
    weekly recommendations than in-house teams or generic BI. Embedded
    change-management playbooks and integrations allow divisions to realize ROI
    within weeks, creating sticky workflows and network effects in benchmark
    quality.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    New home for-sale builders (NAICS 236117) who must price plans/lots and set
    incentives weekly to hit absorption targets without sacrificing margin.
  problem: >-
    - External: Demand shifts weekly; competitors change prices/incentives;
    manual spreadsheets lag; aged specs drive carrying costs.

    - Internal: Uncertainty about when to hold, adjust, or sweeten; fear of
    over-discounting or missing sales goals.

    - Philosophical: Builders shouldn’t have to guess or race to the bottom to
    sell quality homes.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand absorption pressure, backlog risk, lender
    requirements, and community-level constraints.

    - Authority: AI trained on comps, inventory, traffic/leads, plan attributes,
    and historical sales; proven to lift pace 15–30% while protecting gross
    margin; built by ex-builders and data scientists.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: MLS/comps, current pricing, specs/backlog, traffic/leads,
    incentives, costs/margin targets.

    2) Set rules: target sales pace, price floors/ceilings, incentive caps,
    community constraints.

    3) Operate weekly: per plan/lot recommendations with rationale; one-click
    approve/publish; monitor, learn, refine. Includes audit trail, guardrails,
    and permissioned controls.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 20-minute fit call; Start a 60-day pilot in one
    community. Transitional: Download a sample weekly pricing brief and ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Hit target absorption reliably; protect or improve margins; reduce carrying
    costs through faster turns; clear, defensible pricing decisions; confident
    sales teams and aligned lenders; transparent reporting for leadership.
  failure: >-
    Stagnant inventory; missed sales pace; margin erosion from panic discounts;
    incentive creep and weaker comps; strained cash flow and frustrated sales
    teams.

## Business Process Integration Points

The above functions integrate with:
- **CRM Systems**: Salesforce, HubSpot for lead and customer data
- **Analytics Platforms**: GA4 for traffic and conversion tracking  
- **Market Data**: Redfin/Zillow APIs for competitor pricing
- **Financial Systems**: ERP integration for margin and cost tracking
- **Workflow Automation**: Zapier/Make for publishing price changes
- **Approval Systems**: Custom workflow engines for pricing approvals

## Key Performance Indicators

These business processes are designed to achieve:
- **Recommendation Acceptance Rate**: >60% within 90 days
- **Absorption Lift**: +10-20% net sales per community per month
- **Margin Improvement**: +50-150 bps while maintaining pace
- **Forecast Accuracy**: MAPE ≤10-12% for 4-week net sales
- **Time-to-Value**: First recommendations live ≤3 weeks from contract
