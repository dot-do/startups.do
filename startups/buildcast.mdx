  title: Branch-SKU Demand Forecasting & Auto-Replenishment
  description: >-
    Forecast demand by branch/SKU and generate suggested orders with safety
    stocks and seasonality.
  targetUsers:
    - Purchasing
    - Inventory Planners
    - Branch Managers
  triggers:
    - Nightly batch
    - Supplier lead-time changes
    - New item/location added
  inputs:
    - 24–36 months sales by branch/SKU
    - 'Lead times, MOQs, vendor calendars'
    - 'Stock levels, on-order POs'
    - 'Promotions, seasonality, holidays'
    - Local weather/permits (optional)
  steps:
    - Ingest/clean ERP history and lead-time data
    - Train per-SKU models with seasonality and exogenous features
    - 'Compute reorder points, order-up-to, and risk buffers'
    - Propose POs by vendor considering MOQs and truckload brackets
    - Route exceptions for human approval
    - Post approved POs to ERP and track forecast accuracy
  tools:
    - AWS Forecast/Prophet/BigQuery ML
    - Snowflake/BigQuery
    - NOAA/Tomorrow.io weather APIs
    - Local permits datasets (where available)
    - ERP APIs (P21/Spruce/BisTrack/Agility)
    - BI dashboards (Looker/Power BI)
  outputs:
    - Forecasts (SKU-branch weekly)
    - Suggested PO files by vendor
    - Exception list (new items/intermittent demand)
    - Service level and forecast accuracy reports
  pricingModel:
    - Monthly subscription by SKU/branch tier
    - One-time onboarding for data pipelines

  problem:
    - >-
      Branch/SKU demand is highly seasonal (weather- and project-driven),
      causing 20–40% forecast error for many dealers using static min/max or
      spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Stock-outs on high-velocity SKUs (cement, drywall, roofing, fasteners)
      drive lost sales and costly expedites; fill rates often <92% vs target
      97–98%.
    - >-
      Excess inventory ties up working capital; DIO commonly 80–120 days when
      55–75 is achievable for comparable mix.
    - >-
      Lead times are volatile (imported millwork, siding, windows/doors), and
      existing ERPs seldom recalculate safety stock dynamically based on
      variability, causing either overstock or shortages.
    - >-
      Buyers/planners spend 8–15 hours/week per branch creating POs across
      hundreds of vendors; manual work ignores constraints (MOQs, case packs,
      truckload rounding, vendor calendars).
    - >-
      Limited signal usage: quotes, takeoffs, contractor project pipelines,
      permits, and local weather are rarely fed into replenishment logic,
      missing early demand cues.
    - >-
      Fragmented multi-branch visibility leads to misallocation between branches
      and late transfers; DC logic is basic, wasting freight and time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest daily sales, on-hand/on-order, lead times, vendor constraints,
      quotes, and lost-sales signals from ERP; enrich with weather and
      building-permit data per branch.
    - >-
      Generate weekly/daily branch-SKU forecasts using hierarchical, seasonal,
      and promotion-aware models tuned for building materials (long lead times,
      lumpy project demand).
    - >-
      Compute dynamic reorder points and safety stocks to target service levels
      (e.g., 97–99%) using actual lead-time variability and demand volatility.
    - >-
      Produce auto-suggested POs per vendor with rounding to
      case/pallet/truckload, MOQ/MOV checks, vendor calendars, and split between
      DC vs direct-to-branch.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: planners review only exceptions (forecast spikes,
      supplier delays, stocking policy changes), not every SKU.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: simulate service levels, inventory, and cash impact under
      policy changes (e.g., tighter safety stock, new vendor lead times).
    - >-
      Cross-branch transfer recommendations before buying new stock to reduce
      overstock and freight.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: incorporate accept/reject PO feedback, actual lead
      times, and service results to retrain models monthly.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase fill rate to 97–98% while reducing DIO by 15–30 days through
    branch-SKU AI forecasting that ingests weather, permits, and project
    pipeline data, and auto-builds purchase orders that respect vendor and
    freight constraints—implemented in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-tuned forecasting and replenishment with prebuilt connectors to
    common LBM ERPs, enriched by localized weather and building-permit signals
    plus project/quote ingestion—delivering measurable gains in fill rate and
    DIO within 90 days and requiring minimal IT lift. Feedback loops from PO
    accept/reject and lead-time drift further improve outcomes branch-by-branch.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Inventory and purchasing leaders at multi-branch Other Building Material
    Dealers (NAICS 444180) who need the right stock by branch/SKU to meet
    contractor demand without tying up cash.
  problem: >-
    External: Stockouts on fast movers and excess on slow movers from blunt
    min/max and spreadsheets that ignore seasonality, projects, MOQs, and
    variable lead times. Internal: Buyers are firefighting, unsure what to
    order, and accountable for misses. Philosophical: Contractors should get
    materials when promised; inventory should fuel growth—not sit in the yard.
  guide: >-
    We understand project-driven, seasonal demand in building materials and the
    pressure to hit fill rates without bloating inventory. Our AI inventory
    co-pilot is purpose-built for branch/SKU decisions, backed by supply-chain
    veterans, reference dealers, and fast ROI.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/POS, vendor lead times, and history (1–2 weeks). 2) Train
    branch-SKU models with seasonality, service levels, safety stocks, and
    variability. 3) Generate suggested POs and exception reviews; sync to your
    ERP. Agreement: 90-day, 2-branch pilot; fixed price; cancel anytime; your
    data stays yours; SOC 2–ready.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30-minute demo. Transitional: Get a sample forecast and
    reorder policy report for your top SKUs.
  success: >-
    95–98% fill rates, 10–20% lower inventory, 30–50% fewer expedites, less dead
    stock, smoother cash flow, and buyers focused on supplier strategy—not
    spreadsheets.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing orders, miss jobs from stockouts, tie up cash in the yard, pay
    rush freight, and lose contractors to competitors who have stock.
