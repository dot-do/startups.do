leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable consumption leads to stockouts at individual sites, causing
      missed SLAs, emergency runs, and overtime costs.
    - >-
      Over-ordering and bulk buying without usage visibility creates waste
      (expired chemicals, damaged goods, dead stock) and ties up working
      capital.
    - >-
      Manual counts (clipboards/spreadsheets) are time-consuming (0.5–2
      hours/week/site) and error-prone, especially across distributed locations.
    - >-
      Varying lead times and supplier reliability make simple min/max rules
      ineffective, leading to rush orders and high freight costs.
    - >-
      Limited site-level data prevents accurate budgeting, demand planning, and
      vendor negotiations; no standardized way to compare sites/suppliers.
    - >-
      Pilferage and misuse go undetected due to lack of consumption benchmarks
      and alerts.
    - >-
      Sustainability compliance (Green Seal/EPA Safer Choice) and SDS tracking
      are manual and inconsistent.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI forecasting per site/SKU using historical consumption, occupancy,
      seasonality, service frequency, events, and lead-time variability.
    - >-
      Automated replenishment that generates POs at the right time/quantity with
      approval workflows and budget controls; supports EDI/API to major
      distributors.
    - >-
      Mobile-first site app for quick counts/scan-outs (barcode/QR),
      substitutions, and exception logging; optional IoT bin/weight sensors for
      hands-off telemetry.
    - >-
      Multi-supplier optimization to choose preferred/contract items,
      equivalents, and price breaks; enforces green-certified catalogs.
    - >-
      Real-time dashboards for stockout risk, inventory turns, usage variance,
      and supplier OTIF; alerts for anomalies, pilferage, and compliance issues.
    - >-
      SDS library and compliance tracking tied to SKUs; automated usage and
      sustainability reporting (e.g., Green Seal/EPA Safer Choice).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts and waste by predicting site-level chemical and consumable
    usage and automating replenishment—cut inventory 25–40%, stockouts 60–90%,
    and buying/admin time 50%+ within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, cross-supplier forecasting and auto-replenishment with a
    growing proprietary dataset of site-level consumption and outcomes, enabling
    superior accuracy and anomaly detection that generic inventory tools and
    single-distributor VMI programs can’t match; plus pre-built integrations to
    janitorial ops platforms and distributor EDI that cut onboarding from months
    to weeks.
