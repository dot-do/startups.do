  problem:
    - >-
      Pattern makers and tech designers spend 1–3 hours per style extracting key
      measurements from base patterns/tech packs and building graded spec
      tables.
    - >-
      Grade rule creation is error-prone and inconsistent across categories,
      seniority levels, and geographies, leading to costly fit issues and
      iterations.
    - >-
      Legacy CAD tools (Gerber, Lectra, Optitex, Tukatech) provide grading
      functionality but not automated extraction/standardization across
      disparate inputs (PDFs, DXFs, native CAD) or AI-guided grade proposals.
    - >-
      Brands and OEM/ODM factories lack a centralized, auditable way to compare
      grades to size charts and historical fit performance.
    - >-
      Time-to-market pressures require faster style turnarounds with fewer
      technical staff; manual workflows don’t scale without quality loss.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest base patterns and tech packs from multiple sources (native CAD
      exports, DXF/AAMA, PDF, image scans) and auto-detect pattern pieces,
      measurement points, and nomenclature.
    - >-
      Map extracted measurements to standardized taxonomies
      (ASTM/brand-specific) and generate a clean base-spec for the sample size.
    - >-
      Propose grading increments using AI trained on category/brand norms and
      target size charts; respect constraints (proportional vs. non-proportional
      zones, cap increments, anchor points).
    - >-
      Output: graded spec tables (CSV/Excel/PLM import), CAD-grade rule files
      (for major CAD systems), and side-by-side diffs against house standards.
    - >-
      Quality controls: confidence scores, rule conflicts flagging, tolerance
      checks, and a “human-in-the-loop” editor to accept/override proposals.
    - >-
      Integrations: plug-ins/connectors for major CAD and PLM systems; API/SDK
      for custom pipelines; on-prem/private cloud deployment for IP-sensitive
      customers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate spec extraction and grade-rule creation from patterns and tech
    packs—produce validated graded spec tables and CAD rule files in minutes,
    not hours—cutting cycle time 70–90% with enterprise-ready accuracy and
    integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-CAD, cross-format AI models trained on a proprietary, category-diverse
    dataset with human-in-the-loop feedback from expert graders, plus certified
    integrations that produce ready-to-use CAD grade files and PLM-ready spec
    tables—reducing rework and fit risk at enterprise scale.
