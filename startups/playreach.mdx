  problem:
    - >-
      Independent and small-chain hobby/toy/game retailers lack time and
      in-house expertise to plan, build, and optimize ever-changing paid
      social/search campaigns.
    - >-
      Creative fatigue and low testing velocity reduce return on ad spend; most
      stores refresh creatives infrequently and run too few experiments per
      month.
    - >-
      Inventory changes rapidly (new releases, restocks, seasonal items), but
      ads are not inventory-aware, leading to budget waste on out-of-stock
      items.
    - >-
      Retailers underutilize available co-op/MDF funds from brands due to
      complex rules and manual claims processes, leaving 20–40% of eligible
      funds on the table.
    - >-
      Local foot-traffic attribution is hard; most stores can’t connect ad spend
      to in-store events, visits, and POS sales, which undermines confidence and
      budget.
    - >-
      Agencies and generic ad tools are costly or not tailored to the vertical
      (events, store visits, TCG launches), leading to poor fit and inconsistent
      results.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click integrations to POS/ecommerce (Shopify, Lightspeed, Square,
      WooCommerce, BigCommerce) to sync products, inventory, promotions, and
      events.
    - >-
      AI-generated, brand-safe creatives (static/video) and copy tuned to
      vertical best practices; variants automatically created by product type
      and seasonality.
    - >-
      Autonomous campaign setup for Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Google
      (Search/Shopping/Performance Max), and TikTok; inventory-aware product
      feeds and exclusions.
    - >-
      Always-on testing engine (audiences, creatives, bids, budgets) with weekly
      iterations; auto-pauses underperformers, scales winners to reach target
      ROAS/CPA.
    - >-
      Local store-visit and event promotion objectives (e.g., Friday Night
      Magic); geo-fencing around store trade areas; direction-click and call
      tracking.
    - >-
      Co-op/MDF automation: brand template libraries, eligible-SKU detection,
      pre-approved creatives, spend tracking, and claims documentation export.
    - >-
      Attribution and reporting combining ecommerce, POS, and platform data;
      unified dashboard for ROAS, MER, in-store sales lift, store visits, and
      test impact.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails for kids/family products (platform/country rules,
      COPPA-related targeting), excluding underage targeting and enforcing
      audience policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Inventory-aware, co-op-compliant ad autopilot purpose-built for
    hobby/toy/game retailers that creates, launches, and iterates paid
    social/search campaigns tied to POS inventory, events, and store
    visits—improving ROAS and local foot traffic with minimal effort.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically-specific performance dataset (inventory, events, seasonality)
    paired with co-op/MDF partnerships and compliance templates enables faster,
    safer, and more effective automation than generic ad tools or agencies.
    Inventory-aware creatives + event marketing + co-op automation in one stack
    are difficult to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      locations and Shopify/Lightspeed/Square POS, monthly digital ad spend

      creative/testing and localized execution at the store level.

    merchandising and community-building.
  failure: >-
    Wasted budget on stale ads, missed seasonal windows, guesswork targeting,
    and fragmented reporting that hides what’s working.
