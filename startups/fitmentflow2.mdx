  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers face high ticket volume from fitment questions
      (Year/Make/Model/Engine), installation guidance, order status, and
      returns—often 3–8 tickets per 100 orders.
    - >-
      Wrong-part fitment is a top driver of returns; 20–30% of returns in
      parts/accessories are fitment-related, eroding margin via reverse
      logistics, restocking, and damage.
    - >-
      Support teams lack 24/7 coverage; average first response times are 2–12
      hours via email/tickets and 2–10 minutes on chat, leading to cart
      abandonment and poor CSAT.
    - >-
      Agents must navigate fragmented systems (catalogs, OMS/WMS, carrier
      tracking, ACES/PIES/TecDoc) which increases handle time by 3–7 minutes per
      ticket.
    - >-
      Generic chatbots cannot safely reason about vehicle fitment/interchange;
      hallucinations create liability and distrust.
    - >-
      Seasonality (winter tires, off-road season, SEMA sales) and promotions
      cause unpredictable surges that current staffing models cannot
      cost-effectively absorb.
    - >-
      Returns/RMA workflows are inconsistent and manual; customers lack
      self-service options, increasing agent workload by 15–25%.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks accurate visibility into support cost per order,
      containment rate, and root causes of returns, limiting continuous
      improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Domain-tuned AI agent for email, chat, and ticketing that reasons over
      ACES/PIES/TecDoc/YMME to answer fitment/compatibility with provenance.
    - >-
      Automated order status, delivery ETA, and return eligibility/RMA creation
      via OMS/WMS/carrier integrations.
    - >-
      Installation guidance with step-by-step instructions, torque specs and
      tool lists where available, plus safety-aware gating that escalates
      high-risk cases.
    - >-
      Smart escalation: routes to the right queue with full context (VIN/YMME,
      part numbers, cart, prior messages, diagnostics) and suggested macros,
      cutting AHT by 40–60%.
    - >-
      Proactive deflection in PDP/cart: answers “will this fit?” and recommends
      required accessories/hardware to increase attach rate by 5–10%.
    - >-
      Self-serve returns portal powered by the agent with dynamic rules
      (restocking fees, hazardous materials, opened/installed items).
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: captures resolutions and return root causes to
      improve catalog mapping and reduce future tickets.
    - >-
      Audit trail and proof-of-fit card stored with orders to reduce disputes
      and streamline returns decisions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An omnichannel AI support agent purpose-built for automotive parts and
    accessories that delivers accurate fitment answers, safe installation
    guidance, instant order/returns support, and smart escalation—reducing

    improving CSAT and response time to seconds.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary fitment knowledge graph and resolution dataset combining
    ACES/PIES/TecDoc, brand catalogs, and anonymized post-sale
    resolutions/returns across retailers—enabling high-precision,
    liability-aware fitment guidance with provenance that generic bots cannot
    replicate; plus deep native integrations to auto commerce and helpdesk
    ecosystems and safety gating tuned for automotive use cases.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Automotive parts and accessories retailers who want instant, accurate
    support across chat, email, and ticketing while reducing returns and support
    load.
  problem: >-
    Villain: messy fitment data and fragmented support channels. External:
    customers ask “Will this fit?”, “How do I install it?”, “Where’s my order?”
    Internal: agents are overwhelmed and context-switching, risking errors.
    Philosophical: buying parts shouldn’t require waiting on a counterperson or
    phone queue.
  guide: >-
    We understand high-stakes fitment and peak-season volume. With deep
    aftermarket and conversational‑AI expertise, we connect to your catalog
    (ACES/PIES), OMS, ecommerce, and help desk to deliver accurate answers with
    human warmth and smart escalation.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect channels and data (chat/email/ticketing, catalog/ACES‑PIES, OMS).
    2) Configure intents, policies, tone, and escalation; import FAQs. 3) Launch
    with guardrails, monitor analytics, and continuously train to expand
    coverage.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 20‑minute demo. Transitional: Get a free fitment‑support
    audit.
  success: >-
    Customers get instant, accurate fitment, install, order status, and returns
    help 24/7. Agents focus on complex issues. Results: faster resolutions,
    higher conversion, fewer wrong‑fit returns, lower support costs, and higher
    CSAT.
  failure: >-
    Without it, tickets pile up, shoppers churn, wrong‑fit returns rise, agents
    burn out, costs climb, and reviews and revenue suffer.
