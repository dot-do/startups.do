    - TIFF/PDF images
    - Language/script info
    - Desired output formats
  steps:
    - 'Layout detection, OCR/HTR'
    - Confidence scoring and noise filtering
    - LM-assisted spelling/post-correction
    - Embed text into PDFs; export ALTO/TEI/Plain Text
    - Sample QA and error report
    - Package deliverables

    - 'Tesseract, ABBYY, or Google Vision'
    - Transkribus (HTR)
    - OpenAI API (post-correction)
    - ocrd_all/ocrmypdf

    - Premium for HTR or complex layouts
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4
  risks:
    - Poor scan quality limits accuracy
    - Handwritten/cursive variability
    - Cloud OCR costs
  dependencies:
    - Access to image files (SFTP/cloud)
    - Rights clearance for processing
    - Language models for target scripts
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Large digitization backlogs: millions of scanned pages sit as images or
      PDFs without full text, blocking discovery and accessibility.
    - >-
      Historical print and handwriting are hard: 18th–20th c. typefaces, mixed
      languages/scripts, marginalia, and degraded paper reduce OCR/HTR accuracy
      by 20–60% vs. modern print.
    - >-
      Limited QA: institutions often cannot measure or prove text quality (no
      CER/WER baselines, no sampling plans), making vendor comparisons and grant
      reporting difficult.
    - >-
      Standards compliance gap: outputs often lack ALTO XML or TEI P5, or fail
      schema validation; IIIF search and annotation integration is inconsistent.
    - >-
      High cost of manual correction: in-house or crowdsourced correction can
      exceed $0.10–$0.50 per page in staffing time.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows: digitization, OCR, metadata, DAM/IR integration
      (CONTENTdm, Islandora, DSpace, ArchivesSpace, Primo/Alma) require brittle,
      manual steps.
    - >-
      Data governance constraints: some collections require on-prem/VPC
      processing, audit trails, and no external data sharing — many AI services
      are cloud-only or non-compliant.
    - >-
      Funding-cycle risk: projects run on grants with fixed deliverables and
      audits; institutions need predictable pricing, documented QA, and
      reproducible pipelines.
    - >-
      Accessibility/compliance: legal and policy requirements for searchable,
      screen-reader–friendly PDFs and WCAG alignment are rising, but current
      pipelines don’t deliver consistently.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingestion: Accept TIFF/JPEG/PDF/JP2 and IIIF endpoints;
      auto-language/script detection and page-type classification.
    - >-
      Pre-processing: De-skew, de-noise, binarize; layout and region
      segmentation (text blocks, headers, tables, marginalia, footnotes).
    - >-
      Model selection: Route by era/script to best OCR/HTR stack (e.g.,
      kraken/eScriptorium models for historical print/HTR; transformer OCR for
      modern print), with per-batch A/B evaluation.
    - >-
      LLM-based post-correction: Domain-tuned, cost-optimized language models
      perform context-aware normalization and correction; rulesets for spelling
      variants preserved in TEI where desired.
    - >-
      Quality estimation and scoring: Calibrated confidence, dictionary/language
      models, and sample-based CER/WER to produce a per-page and per-batch
      quality score with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Standards output: Generate ALTO XML (v4), TEI P5 (with provenance,
      certainty, and normalization), PDF/A searchable, and IIIF Search API
      annotations; validate against schemas.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Web UI to spot-check, correct, and approve pages;
      active learning loops to retrain models on corrected lines/words.
    - >-
      Integration and delivery: Push to CONTENTdm, Islandora, DSpace, Fedora,
      ArchivesSpace, Alma/Primo; export to S3/Azure/GCS and OAI-PMH; publish
      IIIF manifests with search.
    - >-
      Governance and security: On-prem/VPC deployment option; full audit trail,
      role-based access, PII redaction, and no data exfiltration without
      contract.
    - >-
      Reporting: Grant-ready QA reports (CER/WER, sampling plans), cost and
      throughput reports, and accessibility conformance statements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Highest-quality, standards-ready OCR/HTR for historical collections with
    measurable accuracy, automated LLM-based correction, and turnkey delivery to
    ALTO/TEI and searchable PDFs—deployable in cloud or on-prem with direct
    DAM/IIIF integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, governed corpus of historically diverse ground truth paired with
    an evaluation harness for CER/WER and ALTO/TEI validation, enabling superior
    LLM-driven post-correction and continuous improvement—combined with turnkey
    DAM/IIIF integrations and on-prem deployment that many competitors lack.
