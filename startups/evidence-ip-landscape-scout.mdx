leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      R&D and BD teams spend 40–80 person-hours per landscaping cycle to find
      and synthesize prior art across literature, preprints, and patents;
      results are quickly outdated (weeks).
    - >-
      Critical prior art is missed due to synonymy (targets/indications/modality
      names), inconsistent annotations, and siloed sources—creating FTO exposure
      and duplicated R&D effort.
    - >-
      Existing alerts are noisy and non-actionable (low precision, lack of
      context, no claim-scoped views), forcing manual triage by senior
      scientists or IP analysts.
    - >-
      Linking biological target → modality → indication evidence is manual;
      teams cannot quickly visualize gaps (white space) or strength of evidence
      across the triad.
    - >-
      Enterprise tools are expensive and broad; they lack biology-specific NLP,
      passage-level grounding, and real-time preprint → patent linkage needed
      for early discovery decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified evidence graph that normalizes targets (HGNC/UniProt), modalities
      (controlled vocabularies), and indications (MeSH/DOID) and links them to
      paper sections, preprint passages, and patent claims.
    - >-
      High-recall retrieval with domain ontologies and synonym expansion; RAG
      summaries that cite exact passages with confidence scores and DOIs/patent
      IDs.
    - >-
      Claim-scoped IP view: parses independent/dependent claims, extracts scope,
      entities, novelty cues, assignees, and litigation/licensing signals.
    - >-
      Gap analysis and white-space maps across the target–modality–indication
      triad with evidence strength, trends, and competitive density
      visualizations.
    - >-
      Precision alerts: new preprints/patents, prosecution updates, and material
      evidence shifts with user-tunable filters and relevance feedback.
    - >-
      Collaboration and integrations: export to ELNs/LIMS, Slack/Teams, and BI
      tools; API for programmatic use; audit trails for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Source-grounded, biology-aware AI that maps the literature, preprints, and
    patents around any target–modality–indication triad in minutes—not
    weeks—reducing search time by ~90%, improving relevant-art recall by 20–35%
    vs keyword baselines, and continuously alerting on changes with claim-level
    evidence and actionable gap analysis.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Biology-first, passage-grounded triad mapping (target–modality–indication)
    with claim-scoped IP synthesis and validated retrieval benchmarks, plus a
    continuously learning synonym/ontology layer and private-index
    option—delivering higher recall with actionable, audit-ready evidence in
    minutes.

    Biotech R&D and IP decision-makers (therapeutics, diagnostics, tools; NAICS
    541714, excluding nanobiotechnology) who need fast, defensible visibility
    around a target, modality, or indication.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented, fast-moving literature and patent activity make it easy to miss
    prior art, duplicate work, or be surprised by freedom-to-operate
    risks—slowing decisions and wasting budget.
  guide: >-
    Evidence & IP Landscape Scout uses domain-tuned AI to produce
    source-grounded maps of literature, preprints, and patents with transparent
    citations, configurable alerts, and optional analyst review—so teams can
    trust and act on the evidence.
  plan: >-
    - Define scope (target/modality/indication, timelines, jurisdictions)

    - Ingest and normalize sources; cluster, rank, and tag claims and entities

    - Deliver interactive landscape with gap (white-space) and convergence
    analysis, plus IP watch alerts

    - Review findings, refine queries, and set update cadence or integrations
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute scoping call to define your landscape.
    Transitional: Download a sample report and alert digest.
  success: >-
    Make confident go/no-go calls, surface whitespace early, accelerate filings,
    reduce FTO risk, and focus R&D on the highest-value opportunities.
  failure: >-
    Miss critical prior art, enter crowded spaces, file late, or burn budget on
    duplicative experiments and blocked IP.
