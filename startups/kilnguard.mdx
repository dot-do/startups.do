  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned kiln and material-handling downtime (fans, blowers, burners,
      conveyors, mixers) leads to lost throughput, off-spec batches, and costly
      scrap; a single kiln outage can cost $10k–$40k per hour plus energy and
      rework.
    - >-
      Failure modes (bearing wear, belt misalignment, burner flame instability,
      refractory hot spots, motor overloads) are still detected by periodic
      rounds and manual logs, missing early warnings buried in high-frequency
      telemetry.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLC/SCADA historians (OPC UA, PI), VFDs, and CMMS;
      there is little automated linkage between anomalies and maintainable
      actions (work orders, spares).
    - >-
      Energy is 15–30% of unit cost in firing; suboptimal combustion and airflow
      control raise energy per ton by 3–10%, especially during startups and load
      changes.
    - >-
      Skilled maintenance labor is constrained; reactive firefighting crowds out
      planned work, inflating overtime and spare-parts inventories.
    - >-
      Generic PdM tools underperform on thermal-process equipment; kiln-specific
      dynamics (zone-to-zone interactions, thermal lag, batch/cycle effects)
      require domain-tuned models.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud platform ingesting time-series telemetry (vibration,
      temperature, current, pressure, gas flow, O2, thermocouples, VFD data) via
      OPC UA/MQTT/PI and merging with maintenance logs/CMMS history.
    - >-
      Pretrained kiln and material-handling models: anomaly detection, remaining
      useful life (RUL), and fault classification for bearings, belts,
      fans/blowers, burners, mixers, and conveyors; thermal profile analytics
      for kiln zones.
    - >-
      Action orchestration: risk-ranked alerts convert to CMMS work orders
      (Fiix/eMaint/Maximo/IFS) with recommended tasks, spares, and standard job
      plans.
    - >-
      Energy optimization: detect combustion drift (O2, CO), airflow imbalance,
      and zone overheating/underheating; quantify energy-per-ton impact and
      suggest setpoint adjustments.
    - >-
      Operator-first UX: clear fault explanations, confidence scores, expected
      lead time, and video/SOP links; mobile and control-room views; edge
      buffering for unreliable networks.
    - >-
      MLOps and governance: model performance monitoring, auto-retraining on
      seasonality and recipe changes, audit trail for alerts to outcomes; data
      security aligned to SOC 2 and IEC 62443.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict, prioritize, and prevent kiln and material-handling failures with
    domain-tuned AI that integrates with your PLC/SCADA and CMMS. Reduce
    unplanned downtime by 30–50%, cut firing energy per ton by 3–8%, and surface
    actionable work orders with 10–30 days of lead time—deployed in 4–6 weeks
    using existing data plus low-cost sensors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  problem: >-
    Unplanned failures in fans, blowers, burners, conveyors, and mixers trigger
    scrap, missed firings, high gas/power spend, and safety risk. Data lives in
    SCADA/CMMS but rarely warns early; hidden degradation (bearings, imbalance,
    burner drift, gearbox faults) keeps teams firefighting.

    equipment. Our AI turns time-series telemetry and maintenance logs into
    early warnings with proven models, domain features, and clear fault
    signatures—so your team acts before failures happen.
