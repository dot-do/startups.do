leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Consulting teams spend 30–80 hours per engagement consolidating scattered
      decks, reports, and notes into a coherent strategic narrative.
    - >-
      Insights are locked in inconsistent formats (PPT, PDF, Miro exports,
      email) across SharePoint/Drive/Box, leading to duplication,
      contradictions, and missed facts.
    - >-
      Partners need a prioritized 12‑month roadmap with owners and KPIs, but
      analysts deliver slide dumps without clear sequencing and dependencies.
    - >-
      Manual synthesis is error‑prone and hard to audit; leaders lack
      traceability from recommendations to source evidence.
    - >-
      Security/compliance policies restrict use of public AI tools; building a
      secure, effective in‑house solution is costly and slow.
    - >-
      Knowledge reuse is poor: prior engagements’ assets aren’t leveraged
      efficiently, increasing delivery time and cost of sales.
  solution:
    - >-
      Secure ingestion connectors (SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box,
      Slack, Confluence, email) with OCR for scans and multilingual support.
    - >-
      AI synthesis pipeline: deduplicate content, detect contradictions, cluster
      themes, extract insights, and map to strategy frameworks (SWOT, 7S, OKR,
      value chain).
    - >-
      Priority engine: scores initiatives on impact/effort, dependencies, risk,
      and strategic fit; outputs a 12‑month roadmap with phases, RACI,
      milestones, and KPIs.
    - >-
      Provenance & audit: every recommendation links to source pages/slides;
      change tracking with human‑in‑the‑loop review and acceptance workflow.
    - >-
      Templates: partner‑style brief, executive summary, stakeholder map, risk
      register, and transformation dashboard compatible with PPT/Word/Notion/PM
      tools.
    - >-
      Deployment options: multi‑tenant SaaS, private VPC, or on‑prem; SSO
      (SAML/OIDC), data residency, encryption at rest/in transit.
    - >-
      Integrations to export into PM tools (Smartsheet, Jira, Asana) and CRM
      (Salesforce) for post‑sell delivery.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From scattered slides and notes to a partner‑ready strategic brief with
    prioritized initiatives and a 12‑month roadmap—delivered in hours, with full
    source citations and enterprise‑grade security.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary provenance graph and prioritization engine tuned on thousands
    of sanitized strategy artifacts and evaluation tasks, combined with
    enterprise‑grade security and consulting‑native templates—yielding faster,
    auditable briefs that generic LLM tools or internal prompt hacks cannot
    reliably deliver.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Boutique and mid‑market management consulting firms (20–500 consultants)
      focused on strategy/operations/PMO.
    - >-
