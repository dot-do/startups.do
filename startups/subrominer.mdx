  problem:
    - >-
      Missed subrogation opportunities: 10–20% of recoverable cases are never
      pursued due to manual triage and bandwidth constraints, resulting in
      millions of dollars in lost recovery annually per mid/large carrier.
    - >-
      Inefficient manual review: Adjusters spend 20–45 minutes per file scanning
      notes, photos, bills, and police reports to decide if subrogation is
      viable, delaying action and increasing leakage.
    - >-
      Inconsistent demand packages: Variation in letter quality, facts, statutes
      cited, and attachments reduces acceptance rates and slows negotiations.
    - >-
      Long cycle times: Demand drafting and document gathering can take 3–7
      days; statutes of limitations and notice requirements are missed or
      approached, reducing leverage.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: Key evidence is spread across claim notes, PDFs,
      emails, repair estimates, medical bills, telematics, and police reports;
      evidence is often omitted from demand packages.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: Subrogation teams lack real-time insight into
      opportunity funnel, hit rates by line/jurisdiction, and adjuster-level
      performance.
    - >-
      Compliance and liability risk: Jurisdiction-specific negligence regimes
      (pure comparative, modified, contributory) and SOL requirements are
      applied inconsistently; PII/PHI handling introduces security exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated opportunity mining: Parse claim data, notes, media, police
      reports, invoices, and telematics to predict subrogation viability with
      confidence scores and expected recovery range.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-aware liability assessment: Apply state negligence regimes,
      thresholds, and statute-of-limitations countdowns to prioritize and route
      cases.
    - >-
      Demand package drafting: Generate fact summaries, liability arguments,
      damages breakdowns, statutes/case law cites, and assemble attachments;
      output in carrier templates for adjuster/legal review.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: Adjustable confidence thresholds; reviewer
      redlines improve models via active learning; full audit trail of edits and
      approvals.
    - >-
      System integrations: Connectors for Guidewire ClaimCenter, Duck Creek
      Claims, SharePoint/OneDrive, S3/SFTP, email ingestion, repair estimating
      systems; write-back notes and tasks.
    - >-
      Negotiation support: Auto-generate counteroffers and clarifications based
      on opposing carrier responses; track acceptance/rejection reasons.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II, encryption at rest/in transit,
      configurable PII/PHI redaction, data residency controls, legal hold and
      retention policies.
    - >-
      Analytics & reporting: Dashboard for opportunity funnel, precision/recall,
      $ recovered, cycle time, adjuster productivity, jurisdictional
      performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover more, faster: AI that mines closed and open claim files to flag
    high-probability subrogation and auto-drafts compliant, evidence-backed
    demand packages—reducing cycle time by 40–60% and lifting recoveries by
    10–30% with auditable precision.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from adjuster/legal edits and opposing-carrier outcomes
    tied to jurisdiction-aware rules, creating a continuously improving,
    explainable model-plus-rules system; deep core platform integrations and
    audited templates accelerate time-to-value and are harder to replicate than
    generic LLM tooling.

  character: >-
    Claims and subrogation leaders at P&C insurers, TPAs, and self-insureds who
    need to surface more recovery opportunities and standardize demand drafting
    without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    They juggle high claim volumes, fragmented evidence, short statutes, and
    inconsistent demand quality—so viable subrogation is missed, cycle times
    drag, leakage rises, and money owed isn’t returned promptly or fairly.

    combining subrogation/legal know-how with secure, compliant data handling
    and claim-system integrations—augmenting adjusters, not replacing them.
  plan: >-
    Simple 3-step plan: 1) Pilot—securely ingest a sample set; AI mines likely
    subro and drafts demand packages. 2) Review—adjuster/legal review with audit
    trail; tune thresholds and templates. 3) Deploy—integrate to claim systems,
    track outcomes, and continuously improve. Optional success-fee pricing.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute pilot scoping or upload a de-identified closed-claim
    sample for a free opportunity scan and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Capture more recoveries with less effort; shorten cycle times; avoid missed
    statutes; deliver consistent, attorney-ready demand packages; free adjuster
    capacity; and build a defensible, data-driven subrogation pipeline.
  failure: >-
    Missed recoveries persist, statutes expire, LAE remains high, demand quality
    stays uneven, teams burn out, and competitors out-recover you.
