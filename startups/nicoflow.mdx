  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers carry 5,000–50,000 SKUs across cigarettes, OTP, nicotine
      pouches, disposable e-cigs, coils, and e-liquids with highly skewed
      velocity and frequent new SKUs, making manual forecasting error-prone.
    - >-
      Demand is volatile due to tax changes, flavor restrictions, manufacturer
      buy-downs, and promotional cycles; planners lack tools to quickly
      incorporate these shocks.
    - >-
      MOQs, case-pack constraints, and variable supplier lead times (especially
      for imports) make optimal reorder points and economic order quantities
      hard to compute.
    - >-
      Stockouts on A-movers (e.g., top 200 SKUs) immediately impact key account
      retention; overstocks on slow movers tie up working capital and risk
      obsolescence when regs change.
    - >-
      PO creation is manual and time-consuming (4–20 hours/week/planner), with
      limited ability to simulate vendor constraints or consolidate orders
      across categories.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks unified KPIs for forecast accuracy, service levels,
      turns, and dead stock, making it difficult to quantify improvement or hold
      teams accountable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand forecasting: Hierarchical (SKU→brand→category) weekly forecasts at
      SKU-location using gradient boosted models with seasonality, promo, and
      regulatory event features.
    - >-
      Service-level optimized reorder points: Calculate safety stock and reorder
      points targeting 95–98% service levels on A/B SKUs and cost-optimized
      levels on C/D SKUs.
    - >-
      Vendor-constrained PO drafting: Auto-build POs that meet MOQs, case packs,
      pallet layers, price breaks, and combine lines to minimize freight;
      simulate multiple vendors.
    - >-
      Lead time modeling: Continuously learn supplier- and lane-specific lead
      time distributions; adjust for holidays, customs, or policy announcements.
    - >-
      Event and promo overlays: One-click overlays for tax increases, buy-downs,
      flavor bans, price changes; simulate scenarios and lock adjustments.
    - >-
      NPI/long-tail logic: Cold-start demand with analogs and Bayesian priors;
      automatically cap buys on volatile or at-risk SKUs.
    - >-
      Workflow & approvals: Planner workbench, exception-based review, and
      approvals; one-click export via EDI/API to ERP/WMS.
    - >-
      Data pipeline & integrations: Native connectors for NetSuite, Acumatica,
      Sage 100/300, Dynamics 365 BC/FO, QuickBooks Enterprise; WMS/EDI partners;
      optional c-store sell-through via partners.
    - >-
      Measurement & governance: Built-in dashboard for MAPE/WAPE, service level,
      turns, dead stock, and PO cycle time; audit trail for regulators and
      vendors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts 25–40% and excess inventory 10–20% within 90 days while
    auto-generating vendor-ready POs that respect MOQs, case packs, and lead
    times—purpose-built for tobacco and vape wholesalers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized models and datasets that encode regulatory/promo dynamics,
    supplier constraints, and c-store sell-through signals—plus out-of-the-box
    ERP/EDI connectors—deliver faster time-to-value and higher accuracy than
    generic forecasting tools or spreadsheets.

    Tobacco and e‑cigarette merchant wholesalers who want the right SKUs in the
    right DCs at the right time—without tying up cash or relying on guesswork.
  problem: >-
    Volatile demand, complex MOQs and lead times, and frequent launches make
    manual forecasting and PO creation slow and error‑prone—causing stockouts,
    overstock, and margin erosion. You shouldn’t lose sales to preventable
    out‑of‑stocks or sit on aging inventory.
  guide: >-
    We understand the seasonality, regulatory constraints, and SKU churn of
    tobacco and vape distribution. Our supply‑chain AI, built by planners and
    data scientists, turns ERP/POS history into accurate demand forecasts,
    reorder points, and vendor‑ready PO suggestions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/POS and vendor catalogs. 2) Configure MOQs, case packs, lead
    times, and service targets by SKU/vendor/DC. 3) Review forecast and reorder
    points; approve suggested POs. 4) Auto‑generate vendor‑ready POs and track
    exceptions weekly.

    your anonymized data.
  success: >-
    Keep best‑sellers in stock, cut excess inventory, and free working capital.
    Raise fill rates, reduce rush buys, and standardize buying with audit‑ready
    logic—so reps, retailers, and finance all win.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting with spreadsheets, miss MOQs, pay expedite fees, and lose
    sales to out‑of‑stocks while cash is trapped in slow‑movers—eroding margins
    and customer trust.
