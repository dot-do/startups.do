leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Missed subrogation opportunities hidden in unstructured claim notes/docs
      (10–30% of eligible opportunities go undetected in many carriers,
      especially long-tail property and commercial lines).
    - >-
      Delayed first demand issuance (often 30–90 days from FNOL) reduces
      recovery rate and negotiating leverage; statutes of limitation and notice
      requirements are occasionally missed.
    - >-
      High manual effort to read notes, determine liability, calculate damages,
      and assemble evidence; subro analysts spend 30–60% of time on data
      gathering and drafting.
    - >-
      Inconsistent demand quality and compliance across adjusters and vendors;
      lack of standardized templates and jurisdictional language.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (core claims, document management, email) lead to poor
      tracking of timelines, diaries, and responses; weak audit trail for
      arbitration/litigation.
    - >-
      Over-reliance on external BPO subrogation vendors with high contingent
      fees and limited transparency into opportunity triage.
    - >-
      Limited closed-loop measurement: carriers cannot tie detection quality to
      actual recoveries and arbitration outcomes to improve models.
  solution:
    - >-
      NLP/LLM engine scans claim notes, police reports, repair estimates,
      photos, and correspondence to flag third-party liability and coverage
      indicators (e.g., rear-end, contractor negligence, product failure).
    - >-
      Explainable opportunity scoring with evidence highlights and confidence
      levels; human-in-the-loop review workflow.
    - >-
      Automated demand package drafting: letter to liable party/carrier,
      itemized damages (indemnity, deductible, expenses), attachments (invoices,
      estimates, photos), jurisdiction-specific citations, and contact routing.
    - >-
      Timeline engine: calculates and tracks jurisdictional statutes of
      limitation, notice requirements, arbitration filing windows; auto-diarizes
      follow-ups and escalations.
    - >-
      System integrations: connectors for Guidewire, Duck Creek, Origami, One
      Inc docs, OnBase/SharePoint, ISO ClaimSearch, Arbitration Forums eSubro
      Hub.
    - >-
      Closed-loop outcomes: captures recoveries, denials, arbitration results;
      continuously retrains models and improves templates.
    - >-
      Operational analytics: dashboards for opportunity hit-rate,
      time-to-demand, recovery yield, SOL compliance, analyst productivity, and
      ROI.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: PHI/PII redaction, role-based access, audit logs,
      SOC 2 Type II/ISO 27001 ready.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Unlock 5–15% incremental net subrogation recoveries while cutting
    time-to-demand by 30–50% through an explainable, integrated AI that mines
    claim notes/docs to surface third-party liability and auto-drafts
    jurisdiction-ready demand packages with compliant timelines.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop outcomes data from multiple carriers powering a domain-specific,
    explainable LLM with a live statutes/timeline knowledge graph and deep
    core-claims integrations—creating a data and workflow moat that improves
    precision, recall, and speed over time.
