  problem:
    - >-
      Hydraulic power units (HPUs) are often sized for worst-case load and run
      at constant speed/pressure, wasting 15–45% of electrical energy during
      partial-load operation.
    - >-
      NAICS 333996 OEMs and HPU packagers lack fast, evidence-based tools to
      translate customer duty cycles into concrete VSD/valving/control
      recommendations with defensible ROI and M&V acceptable to utilities and
      finance teams.
    - >-
      Sales engineers spend 8–20 hours per opportunity building spreadsheets,
      gathering pump curves, and estimating savings, with low confidence and
      inconsistent assumptions.
    - >-
      End users need credible, measured outcomes to approve capex (typical VSD
      retrofit $25k–$120k per HPU) and to secure rebates; many projects stall
      without auditable savings models.
    - >-
      Facilities face demand charges and sustainability targets (Scope 2);
      without peak shaving strategies (e.g., pressure setpoint optimization,
      accumulator use), demand charges remain 10–40% of the bill.
    - >-
      Controls risk: setting pressures/ramps incorrectly can increase scrap or
      damage equipment; OEMs need safe, validated parameter envelopes and
      suggested PLC code blocks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven assessment: ingest 7–14 days of pressure/flow/motor current
      data via OPC UA/Modbus or portable sensor kit; auto-segment cycles and
      compute baseline kWh and peak kW.
    - >-
      Physics + ML modeling: combine pump/motor efficiency maps, valve
      characteristics, accumulator models, and learned profiles to simulate VSD,
      pressure/valve setpoint changes, and accumulator precharge scenarios.
    - >-
      Auto-sizing and selection: recommend VSD size, pump displacement options
      (incl. variable displacement), and valve changes; flag constraints
      (cooling, NPSH, relief valve, safety).
    - >-
      ROI and proposal generator: output savings (kWh, kW, CO2), capex/opex,
      rebates, downtime assumptions, and payback/IRR; generate a customer-ready
      proposal in minutes.
    - >-
      Controls deployment support: provide parameter envelopes and
      vendor-specific PLC/drive code snippets for ramps, PID gains, and pressure
      schedules; validate against safety and process constraints.
    - >-
      Measurement & Verification: IPMVP Option A/B module compares post-retrofit
      data vs baseline; quantify uncertainty and utility rebate compliance.
    - >-
      Fleet optimization: monitor multiple HPUs, identify additional
      opportunities (pressure setpoint creep, filter clogging, cavitation risk)
      and track realized savings.
