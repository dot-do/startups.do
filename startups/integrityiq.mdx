  problem:
    - >-
      Disparate data silos (ILI, CP/CIS, class location, HCA/MCA, incidents,
      repairs, geohazards) make risk models inconsistent and non-traceable;
      typical IMP updates take 12–24 weeks and rely on spreadsheets and manual
      GIS joins.
    - >-
      Gas Mega Rule expansion (MCAs, MAOP reconfirmation, material verification)
      increases assets under assessment by 20–40% for many operators; teams lack
      capacity to re-baseline risk and plans at required cadence.
    - >-
      Geohazard risks (landslide, subsidence, scour, seismic) are under-modeled;
      few operators integrate InSAR/LiDAR/hydrologic data into risk scoring,
      leading to undetected precursors and unplanned outages.
    - >-
      Prioritization of assessments and digs across thousands of segments is
      budget-blind; operators struggle to optimize for risk reduction per dollar
      and to defend choices to PHMSA auditors.
    - >-
      Audit readiness is painful: assembling data lineage, rationale, and
      evidence packages for API 1160/ASME B31.8S/49 CFR 192 takes weeks and
      exposes gaps.
    - >-
      Model governance is weak: current tools rarely provide explainability,
      versioning, and back-testing against incidents/anomalies, reducing trust
      and adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data fabric: Ingests ILI (MFL/UT/EMAT), digs/repairs, CP/CIS,
      class/HCA/MCA, materials, MAOP history, pressure cycling, incidents, and
      geospatial hazards under a governed schema (PODS/APDM-compatible).
    - >-
      Risk engine aligned to API 1160 and ASME B31.8S: Calculates PoF and CoF at
      feature/segment/system levels; supports method selection (index,
      semi-quantitative, Bayesian) and weight calibration; provides
      explainability per risk component.
    - >-
      Geohazard model stack: Integrates InSAR ground deformation,
      slope/landslide susceptibility, hydrologic/erosion, seismicity; issues
      dynamic threat scores and watchlists with spatial alerts.
    - >-
      Assessment and remediation optimizer: Produces budget-constrained
      schedules (ILI runs, DA, ECDA, ICDA, digs) that maximize risk reduction
      subject to regulatory intervals and resource limits.
    - >-
      IMP plan generator: Creates traceable, versioned plans with data lineage,
      decision rationales, and automated 49 CFR 192 Subpart O references; export
      to auditor “evidence pack.”
    - >-
      Scenario and portfolio planning: What-if modeling for budget changes, tool
      availability, hydrotest alternatives, material verification needs, and
      MAOP reconfirmation pathways.
    - >-
      Data quality and gap analysis: Flags missing attributes (SMYS, seam type,
      coating, CP gaps), anomaly-matching issues, and misaligned pipe tallies;
      quantifies uncertainty impacts on risk.
    - >-
      APIs/Integrations: ESRI (ArcGIS Enterprise/Online), PODS/APDM, Maximo/SAP,
      PI/AVEVA data, ILI vendor formats (ROSEN, NDT Global, Baker Hughes, T.D.
      Williamson), weather feeds.
    - >-
      Governance and model validation: Version control, back-testing against
      incidents/anomaly growth, confidence intervals, and change logs to satisfy
      model risk management and audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    API 1160–aligned, explainable AI that fuses ILI, class location, HCA/MCAs,
    and geohazards to produce a defensible, budget-aware IMP plan in days, not
    months—cutting cycle time by 50–70%, improving risk-reduction per dollar by
    20–30%, and generating audit-ready evidence on demand.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, regulator-ready risk and planning platform purpose-built for
    API 1160 with pre-built ILI/GIS integrations, dynamic geohazard modeling,
    and an audit pack generator that compresses audit prep from weeks to
    hours—validated by back-testing and operator pilots; defensible decision
    lineage reduces regulatory risk and accelerates internal approvals.

  problem:
    - >-
      Risk ranking varies by analyst and dataset; hard to compare segments
      consistently.
    - 'IMP updates lag behind new ILI, class changes, or emerging geohazards.'
    - Budget goes to low-impact digs while high-risk segments wait.
    - Auditors demand traceability; spreadsheets and emails aren’t defensible.
