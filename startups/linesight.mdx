  title: 'Seasonal Trend, Competitor, and Assortment Planner (Accessories)'
  description: >-
    AI agent aggregates market signals and your sales to propose a tight,
    margin-aware seasonal line plan for belts, hats, gloves, bags, and small
    leather goods.
  targetUsers:
    - Head of Product
    - Merchandiser
    - Design Director
  triggers:
    - Seasonal kickoff
    - Missed sales targets
    - Category expansion brief
  inputs:
    - Historical sales by SKU/channel
    - On-hand/inbound inventory
    - Target retail/margin goals
    - Brand positioning and price architecture
    - >-
      Optional: licensed trend feeds (e.g., EDITED/WGSN), Google Trends
      keywords, social handles/hashtags
  steps:
    - 'Ingest client sales/inventory and clean (stockout correction, promo flags)'
    - >-
      Scrape/aggregate public competitor assortment/price data; pull Google
      Trends
    - Cluster demand by category/material/color to identify winners/gaps
    - >-
      Forecast category-level demand; propose SKU counts by category and price
      tier
    - Generate color/material palette and hero SKU list with target costs
    - Human review and iteration; finalize line plan and calendar
  tools:
    - Google Trends API
    - 'EDITED/WGSN (licensed, optional)'
    - Python/pandas
    - Time-series libs (Prophet/Kats)
    - LLM API for insights summarization
    - Power BI/Looker Studio/Google Sheets
  outputs:
    - Seasonal line plan (CSV/Sheets)
    - Color/material palette (PDF/PNG)
    - Competitor benchmark deck (PDF)
    - Forecast by category/channel (CSV)
  pricingModel:
    - Per season package
    - Monthly subscription for rolling refresh
    - One-time setup + per-report fee
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 10
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 9
  risks:
    - Licensed data access limits
    - Competitor scraping blocks
    - Forecast error in volatile categories
  dependencies:
    - Read access to sales/inventory data
    - Brand margin targets
    - Optional trend data licenses
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented inputs cause slow, subjective seasonal planning; teams juggle
      spreadsheets, WGSN-style trends, ad-hoc scraping, and POS exports,
      extending calendar by 2–4 weeks per season
    - >-
      SKU proliferation dilutes margin; typically 20–30% of SKUs drive 80% of
      sales yet lines grow 10–20% YoY, increasing markdown risk and working
      capital
    - >-
      High forecast error on newness; 25–45% MAPE at category level for belts,
      hats, gloves and SLG due to weak analogs and weather-sensitive demand
    - >-
      Margin erosion from reactive pricing; 10–25% of units discounted >30% by
      week 12 due to over-buys and missed competitor moves
    - >-
      MOQ and vendor lead-time constraints are not modeled; planners approve
      lines that cannot be produced profitably within target in-season windows
    - >-
      Inconsistent price architecture across regions and channels; lack of
      visibility to competitive ladders by material, silhouette, and brand tier
    - >-
      Assortment misfit to channel; wholesale, DTC and marketplaces need
      different depth and color/material mixes, but plans are often copied
      across
    - >-
      Manual processes absorb high-value time; 30–50% of a planner’s month is
      spent on data cleansing, pivoting and deck building rather than
      decision-making
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion and normalization from ERP, POS, e-commerce, PLM
      and marketplace channels within 2 weeks via adapters and SFTP
    - >-
      Competitor and market signal engine tracking price ladders, materials,
      silhouettes and colorways across key retailers and DTC brands
    - >-
      Trend nowcasting and short-horizon forecasting combining social velocity,
      search interest, sell-through and weather by metro and channel
    - >-
      Margin-aware line plan generator that meets GM% targets, MOQ constraints,
      lead-times and open-to-buy by month, with adjustable guardrails
    - >-
      Scenario planning and A/B simulations to compare SKU counts, cost options,
      price ladders and vendor splits with projected sell-through
    - >-
      Channel-specific assortments tailoring depth, color, size and price by
      wholesale, DTC and marketplace, with export to PLM and line review decks
    - >-
      Continuous post-mortem and learning loop; captures actuals, computes
      variances and updates guardrails and forecast priors automatically
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accessories-native AI that fuses your sell-through with live competitive
    pricing and trend signals to auto-generate margin-targeted, MOQ- and
    lead-time-aware seasonal line plans in hours, not weeks—reducing SKUs 15–30%
    while lifting gross margin 2–5 points and cutting planning time 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Accessories-first data model and attribute recognition with a proprietary
    competitive panel, coupled with an optimization engine that natively
    accounts for MOQ, vendor lead-times and price ladders—delivering measurable
    margin and planning-cycle impact within one season and supported by
    referenceable design partners and benchmarks.
