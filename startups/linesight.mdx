  vision: "AI-native seasonal planning for accessories brands"
  mission: "Transform accessories planning from weeks to hours with margin-aware AI"
  purpose: "Profitable, efficient seasonal line planning"
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Fragmented inputs cause slow, subjective seasonal planning; teams juggle spreadsheets, WGSN-style trends, ad-hoc scraping, and POS exports, extending calendar by 2–4 weeks per season"
    - "SKU proliferation dilutes margin; typically 20–30% of SKUs drive 80% of sales yet lines grow 10–20% YoY, increasing markdown risk and working capital"
    - "High forecast error on newness; 25–45% MAPE at category level for belts, hats, gloves and SLG due to weak analogs and weather-sensitive demand"
    - "Margin erosion from reactive pricing; 10–25% of units discounted >30% by week 12 due to over-buys and missed competitor moves"
    - "MOQ and vendor lead-time constraints are not modeled; planners approve lines that cannot be produced profitably within target in-season windows"
    - "Inconsistent price architecture across regions and channels; lack of visibility to competitive ladders by material, silhouette, and brand tier"
    - "Assortment misfit to channel; wholesale, DTC and marketplaces need different depth and color/material mixes, but plans are often copied across"
    - "Manual processes absorb high-value time; 30–50% of a planner's month is spent on data cleansing, pivoting and deck building rather than decision-making"
  solution:
    - "Unified data ingestion and normalization from ERP, POS, e-commerce, PLM and marketplace channels within 2 weeks via adapters and SFTP"
    - "Competitor and market signal engine tracking price ladders, materials, silhouettes and colorways across key retailers and DTC brands"
    - "Trend nowcasting and short-horizon forecasting combining social velocity, search interest, sell-through and weather by metro and channel"
    - "Margin-aware line plan generator that meets GM% targets, MOQ constraints, lead-times and open-to-buy by month, with adjustable guardrails"
    - "Scenario planning and A/B simulations to compare SKU counts, cost options, price ladders and vendor splits with projected sell-through"
    - "Channel-specific assortments tailoring depth, color, size and price by wholesale, DTC and marketplace, with export to PLM and line review decks"
    - "Continuous post-mortem and learning loop; captures actuals, computes variances and updates guardrails and forecast priors automatically"
  uniqueValueProp: "Accessories-native AI that fuses your sell-through with live competitive pricing and trend signals to auto-generate margin-targeted, MOQ- and lead-time-aware seasonal line plans in hours, not weeks—reducing SKUs 15–30% while lifting gross margin 2–5 points and cutting planning time 30–50%."
  unfairAdvantage: "Accessories-first data model and attribute recognition with a proprietary competitive panel, coupled with an optimization engine that natively accounts for MOQ, vendor lead-times and price ladders—delivering measurable margin and planning-cycle impact within one season and supported by referenceable design partners and benchmarks."
  customerSegments:
    - "Mid-market accessory brands and labels with 10–300M USD annual revenue focusing on belts, hats, gloves, bags, SLG"
    - "Private-label accessory teams inside multi-category retailers and department stores"
    - "Outdoor and sports brands' accessory divisions (caps, beanies, gloves, packs) with 15–30% revenue contribution from accessories"
    - "Contemporary and affordable luxury houses with SLG and belt capsules needing tight, high-margin lines"
    - "ODM or OEM accessory manufacturers offering design-to-delivery services to retailers and emerging DTC brands"
  channels:
    - "Direct sales to mid-market brands and private-label teams with ROI-focused pilots"
    - "Partnerships and integrations with PLM and planning platforms (e.g., Centric, PTC FlexPLM, Lectra) for co-selling and marketplace listings"
    - "Alliances with ERPs and commerce ecosystems (NetSuite SuiteApp, Microsoft Dynamics, Shopify Plus partners)"
    - "Merchandising and sourcing agencies and ODMs bundling the tool into design-to-delivery retainers"
    - "Industry associations and events (e.g., AAFA, MAGIC, Texworld, NRF) for thought-leadership sessions and live demos"
    - "Content-led growth: quarterly accessories trend and price-ladder reports, ROI calculators and case studies"
    - "Targeted webinars and workshops for planners and merchants; certification for power users"
    - "Founding design partners to co-develop features; discounted first-year pricing in exchange for references"
    - "Outbound SDR sequences aimed at VP Merchandising, Director of Planning and Head of Product in North America and Europe"
    - "Referral program for consultants and fractional merch leaders with revenue share"
  revenueStreams:
    - "SaaS subscription tiers per brand or division: Starter 18–36k USD per year, Growth 60–120k USD per year, Enterprise 150–300k USD per year"
    - "Data add-ons for expanded competitive panels, weather or social signal depth: 1–5k USD per month"
    - "Integration and onboarding fees: 10–50k USD one-time depending on systems and data volume"
    - "Premium support and training packages: 5–20k USD per year"
    - "Managed service add-on (analyst-in-the-loop during seasonal builds): 5–15k USD per season"
    - "API usage fees for high-volume scenario runs or exports beyond plan: 0.02–0.10 USD per scenario compute-minute"
    - "Custom insights and executive readouts per season: 5–25k USD"
  costStructure:
    - "Team payroll: data science and ML 120–180k USD per FTE, data engineering 120–170k, product and design 100–160k, GTM 90–150k"
    - "Cloud compute and storage: 8–25k USD per month at Seed; scales with active clients and model usage"
    - "Licensed data sources (retail assortments, social listening, weather, macro): 5–30k USD per month baseline plus variable access fees"
    - "Third-party integrations and ETL tooling: 2–8k USD per month"
    - "Security and compliance (SOC 2, penetration testing): 50–120k USD annually"

    - "COGS per client estimate: 400–1,200 USD per month in cloud plus 100–500 USD per month incremental data"
    - "Expected monthly burn at Seed Stage: 350–500k USD for a 10–15 person team"

    - "Assortment efficiency: SKU reduction 15–30% while maintaining or growing revenue season over season"
    - "Gross margin lift: +2–5 percentage points within 2 seasons versus baseline"
    - "Forecast accuracy: category-level MAPE under 25% and style-family under 30% by week 8; track WAPE and bias"
