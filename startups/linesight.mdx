  risks:
    - Licensed data access limits

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented inputs cause slow, subjective seasonal planning; teams juggle
      spreadsheets, WGSN-style trends, ad-hoc scraping, and POS exports,
      extending calendar by 2–4 weeks per season
    - >-
      SKU proliferation dilutes margin; typically 20–30% of SKUs drive 80% of
      sales yet lines grow 10–20% YoY, increasing markdown risk and working
      capital
    - >-
      High forecast error on newness; 25–45% MAPE at category level for belts,
      hats, gloves and SLG due to weak analogs and weather-sensitive demand
    - >-
      Margin erosion from reactive pricing; 10–25% of units discounted >30% by
      week 12 due to over-buys and missed competitor moves
    - >-
      MOQ and vendor lead-time constraints are not modeled; planners approve
      lines that cannot be produced profitably within target in-season windows
    - >-
      Inconsistent price architecture across regions and channels; lack of
      visibility to competitive ladders by material, silhouette, and brand tier
    - >-
      Assortment misfit to channel; wholesale, DTC and marketplaces need
      different depth and color/material mixes, but plans are often copied
      across
    - >-
      Manual processes absorb high-value time; 30–50% of a planner’s month is
      spent on data cleansing, pivoting and deck building rather than
      decision-making
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion and normalization from ERP, POS, e-commerce, PLM
      and marketplace channels within 2 weeks via adapters and SFTP
    - >-
      Competitor and market signal engine tracking price ladders, materials,
      silhouettes and colorways across key retailers and DTC brands
    - >-
      Trend nowcasting and short-horizon forecasting combining social velocity,
      search interest, sell-through and weather by metro and channel
    - >-
      Margin-aware line plan generator that meets GM% targets, MOQ constraints,
      lead-times and open-to-buy by month, with adjustable guardrails
    - >-
      Scenario planning and A/B simulations to compare SKU counts, cost options,
      price ladders and vendor splits with projected sell-through
    - >-
      Channel-specific assortments tailoring depth, color, size and price by
      wholesale, DTC and marketplace, with export to PLM and line review decks
    - >-
      Continuous post-mortem and learning loop; captures actuals, computes
      variances and updates guardrails and forecast priors automatically
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accessories-native AI that fuses your sell-through with live competitive
    pricing and trend signals to auto-generate margin-targeted, MOQ- and
    lead-time-aware seasonal line plans in hours, not weeks—reducing SKUs 15–30%
    while lifting gross margin 2–5 points and cutting planning time 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Accessories-first data model and attribute recognition with a proprietary
    competitive panel, coupled with an optimization engine that natively
    accounts for MOQ, vendor lead-times and price ladders—delivering measurable
    margin and planning-cycle impact within one season and supported by
    referenceable design partners and benchmarks.
