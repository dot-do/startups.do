leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual SPC and periodic lab checks (every 30–60 minutes) miss early drift
      in overrun, Brix, and viscosity, leading to holds/rework or giveaway.
    - >-
      Production variability across SKUs, seasonal milk supply, and equipment
      wear causes frequent setpoint chasing and inconsistent quality.
    - >-
      Existing historians/LIMS provide retrospective visibility but lack
      real-time, prescriptive alerts and automated recommendations.
    - >-
      Holds and rework increase costs (ingredients, labor, energy, lost
      capacity) and jeopardize fill-rate; false alarms erode operator trust.
    - >-
      Quality documentation for audits (GFSI/SQF/BRCGS) is fragmented; tying
      process data to batch disposition is time-consuming.
    - >-
      Integrations to PLC/SCADA/MES/LIMS are complex; internal data science
      efforts stall due to lack of domain-specific models and MLOps.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from PLC/SCADA/historians (OPC UA, MQTT, PI, Ignition) and
      LIMS/MES to unify streaming line data with lab results per batch/SKU.
    - >-
      Multivariate anomaly and drift detection tuned for frozen desserts
      (overrun-Brix-viscosity-temperature relationships, SKU-aware).
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations (e.g., adjust air valve %, pump speed, draw
      temperature, stabilizer mix) with confidence scores and expected impact.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts to HMIs, Andon, Teams/Slack/SMS; automated batch
      hold/rework workflow and digital approvals linked to lot IDs.
    - >-
      SPC-plus analytics: dynamic control limits, capability indices, Pareto of
      top deviation drivers; audit-ready electronic records.
    - >-
      Edge-first deployment for sub-second scoring, with cloud or on-prem server
      for dashboards, model lifecycle, and multi-site benchmarking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    FroQC AI detects real-time drift and outliers in overrun, Brix, and
    viscosity from line and lab data, then prescribes targeted setpoint
    adjustments and flags at-risk batches before they go out of spec—cutting
    holds/rework by 25–50% and reducing ingredient giveaway by 0.5–1.5% within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific model library trained on ice cream/frozen dessert
    processes, including SKU-aware and physics-informed features (freezing point
    depression, air incorporation dynamics), plus turnkey connectors to common
    dairy plant systems and validated prescriptive playbooks co-developed with
    lighthouse plants—reducing time-to-value to under 8 weeks and achieving high
    operator trust via low false alarms.
