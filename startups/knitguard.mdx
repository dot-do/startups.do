  problem:
    - >-
      Manual inspection is inconsistent and subjective: typical miss rates of
      20–40% on subtle knit defects (barre, needle lines), leading to quality
      escapes and rework.
    - >-
      Vision inspection tunnels/camera rigs cost $80k–$250k per line plus
      downtime and require dedicated operators; hard to retrofit across many
      lines/locations.
    - >-
      Inspectors already capture phone photos/videos, but mills lack automated
      analysis, standardized defect coding, or roll-level quality scores;
      evidence remains fragmented in chat apps and paper forms.
    - >-
      Defects (holes, oil stains, shading) detected late cause chargebacks and
      delivery delays; quality cost leakage of 1–3% of fabric sales is common in
      export-oriented mills.
    - >-
      Lighting variability, camera shake, and inconsistent capture protocols
      reduce detectability; there’s limited guidance or training at the point of
      inspection.
    - >-
      No real-time triage: rolls aren’t scored or segregated promptly;
      downstream dyeing/cutting lines discover defects too late, inflating
      reprocessing costs.
    - >-
      Traceability/audits are manual; linking roll IDs, machine IDs, operators,
      and defect maps to ERP/MES is cumbersome and error-prone.
    - >-
      Data privacy/IP concerns: mills are wary of sending fabric images offsite;
      need on-device/offline options and strict retention controls.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app with guided capture (photo/video) using AR framing, exposure
      hints, and QR/barcode linking to roll/lot IDs.
    - >-
      On-device and cloud AI models to detect and localize holes (≥1 mm), barre,
      needle lines, oil stains, and shade variation; severity scoring and
      confidence thresholds per defect type.
    - >-
      Roll-level quality score and pass/hold/reject recommendation; immediate
      alerts to segregate defective rolls.
    - >-
      Standardized defect taxonomy mapped to common fabric inspection standards;
      auto-generated AQL-style reports.
    - >-
      Dashboard/analytics: defect heatmaps by machine/shift/yarn lot; FPY, DPMO,
      claims and rework trends; root-cause hypotheses (e.g., needle wear, oil
      drip location).
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common textile ERPs/MES for roll master data,
      quality codes, and claim workflows; CSV/Excel exports for smaller mills.
    - >-
      Privacy and deployment flexibility: offline mode, on-prem container,
      configurable data retention/redaction controls.
    - >-
      Active learning pipeline: operators flag misses/false positives;
      annotation portal to continuously improve mill-specific performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hardware-level defect detection using inspectors’ phones. Deliver roll-level
    quality scores and defect maps in minutes with zero capex, auditable
    traceability, and ERP-ready data—reducing quality escapes by 30–50% and
    paying back in under 3 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rapidly compounding, proprietary, multi-mill dataset of knit defects with
    standardized annotations and capture protocols, paired with on-device
    optimized models and prebuilt ERP integrations. Switching costs rise as
    mills rely on historical defect maps, benchmarks, and SOPs tuned to their
    machines, lighting, yarns, and operators.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and production leaders at knit fabric mills who want to catch
    defects early and ship consistent first‑quality fabric on time.
  problem: >-
    Manual, sight-only inspection misses holes, barre, needle lines, oil stains,
    and shade variation; results vary by shift, causing rework, chargebacks,
    late shipments, and stress.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill-floor pressure and the cost of a missed defect. Our AI
    reviews inspector phone photos/videos and flags knit fabric defects with
    clear labels and locations—no new hardware required.
  plan: >-
    1) Inspectors capture roll photos/videos on their phones; 2) AI analyzes
    frames in near real time to mark defect type, severity, and position; 3)
    Review a roll map, act (stop, cut, rewind), and export reports to QMS/ERP.
    Onboarding: 2‑week pilot, simple lighting calibration, per‑roll pricing.
  callToAction: Book a 20‑minute demo and start a 2‑week pilot on one line.
  success: >-
    Higher first‑quality yield, fewer returns/chargebacks, faster and consistent
    inspections, digital defect maps and audit trails, happier brand customers,
    and lower cost per yard.
  failure: >-
    Hidden defects keep shipping, returns and rework rise, capacity is wasted on
    rescans, operators and buyers get frustrated, and accounts and reputation
    are at risk.

  problem:
    - 'Missed or late defect discovery leads to rework, waste, and chargebacks'
    - Manual inspection is inconsistent and depends on lighting and experience
    - Shade variation and barre are hard to judge consistently on the floor
