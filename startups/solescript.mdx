  problem:
    - >-
      Manual product copywriting is slow and costly: typical workflows take 7–12
      minutes per SKU across title, bullets, long description, and SEO metadata,
      creating multi-week backlogs during seasonal drops.
    - >-
      Inconsistent brand voice across PDPs reduces trust and conversion;
      multiple writers and agencies cause tone drift, repetition, and missing
      key attributes (materials, fit, width, sustainability).
    - >-
      Duplicate or thin descriptions hurt SEO; many retailers copy vendor text,
      resulting in poor rankings and reliance on paid traffic.
    - >-
      Variant explosion (sizes, widths, colorways) overwhelms teams; metadata
      and schema.org markup are often incomplete or incorrect, hurting SERP
      visibility and rich results.
    - >-
      Marketplaces and channels (Google Shopping, Amazon, Walmart,
      Facebook/Instagram) require different copy lengths/structures; manual
      reformatting causes errors and rejections.
    - >-
      Localized copy is underinvested; many retailers skip EN-ES/EN-CA variants
      and region-specific SEO, missing incremental traffic and conversion.
    - >-
      Lack of measurement: most teams can’t tie copy quality to organic CTR,
      time-on-page, or conversion, so improvements stall in favor of paid
      channels.
  solution:
    - >-
      Verticalized AI generation tuned for footwear taxonomy (gender, category,
      silhouette, outsole, upper, width, pronation, arch support, materials)
      ingesting structured attributes from PIM/ecommerce.
    - >-
      Style-guide learning per retailer: tone, banned terms, formatting rules,
      and compliance constraints to ensure auto-approval-ready copy.
    - >-
      Batch workflows: generate and update titles, 3–5 bullets, long
      descriptions, meta title/description, alt text, and schema.org
      Product/Offer markup for thousands of SKUs.
    - >-
      SEO optimizer: keyword mining from search volume/intent, competitor gap
      analysis, and automatic insertion with density/variation controls.
    - >-
      Channel templates for Google Shopping, Amazon, Walmart, Meta, and
      marketplace-specific character limits and attribute requirements.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review queue with confidence scoring; route only
      low-confidence SKUs to humans, reducing review load by 70%+.
    - >-
      A/B testing framework: safely test titles/meta at scale with guardrails;
      monitor CTR, ranking movement, add-to-cart, and conversion.
    - >-
      Localization: EN, ES, FR-CA with region-specific keyword variants and
      units (US/EU sizing).
    - >-
      Versioning and compliance: full change history, revert controls, and
      fact-checking against SKU attributes to prevent hallucinations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    On-brand, channel-ready footwear product copy and SEO metadata in seconds
    per SKU—measurably boosting organic traffic and conversion while cutting
    content time by 80%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Footwear-specialized models and taxonomies, deep PIM/ecommerce integrations,

    competitors’ generic tools can’t match.
