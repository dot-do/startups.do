leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Credit unions lose applicants during onboarding due to slow, manual
      KYC/IDV and document collection (median completion times 1–2 days; mobile
      abandonment >20%).
    - >-
      Compliance teams face fragmented tools (IDV vendor, sanctions screening,
      device risk, LOS) with no unified risk view, causing high false positives
      and rework.
    - >-
      Exam readiness (NCUA/FFIEC) requires manual evidence gathering across
      systems; preparing artifacts can take 40–80 staff hours per exam cycle.
    - >-
      High variability in policies across CUs leads to inconsistent decisions;
      institutional knowledge lives in binders and staff heads, increasing
      operational risk.
    - >-
      Data vendor costs are opaque and rising; credit unions struggle to manage
      stack redundancy and optimize pass rates vs. fraud risk.
    - >-
      Member communications (conditional approvals, document requests, adverse
      action) are inconsistent and time‑consuming to draft and QA for
      compliance.
    - >-
      Small and mid‑size CUs lack data science and model governance resources to
      safely deploy AI for onboarding risk summarization and decision support.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified onboarding risk engine that orchestrates IDV, sanctions/PEP
      screening, device/behavioral signals, and document capture into a single
      case.
    - >-
      AI co‑pilot generates a plain‑language risk summary mapped to CU policy
      and BSA/AML (CIP, CDD/BO, OFAC), with draft approve/conditional/decline
      recommendations and rationale.
    - >-
      Automated document collection via web/mobile SDKs with dynamic checklists,
      selfie/liveness, and OCR data extraction; reminders and abandonment rescue
      flows.
    - >-
      Drafted member communications (welcome, conditional approval requirements,
      adverse action) with embedded disclosures, configurable templates, and
      Spanish/English support.
    - >-
      Exam-ready audit package: immutable decision logs, vendor queries, policy
      references, and evidence export for NCUA/FFIEC; configurable retention
      policies.
    - >-
      Policy and workflow builder: no‑code rules, risk thresholds, exception
      handling, dual control, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.
    - >-
      Core/LOS integrations (MeridianLink, Origence, Symitar/Episys, Fiserv DNA,
      FIS Horizon) to push approved member/account data and pull KYC-relevant
      information.
    - >-
      Model governance: versioned prompts/models, explainability snapshots,
      drift monitoring, and approval workflows to meet model risk management
      expectations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Onboard new members in minutes with exam-ready KYC. Our AI co‑pilot unifies
    IDV, sanctions, fraud signals, and documents into a transparent risk
    summary, proposes decisions and compliant member communications, and
    produces one-click audit artifacts—reducing manual work 50–70% while
    improving pass rates and compliance consistency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Credit‑union‑specific policy packs and exam artifact generator integrated
    with core/LOS systems, plus a growing consortium dataset (opt‑in,
    privacy‑preserving) that improves risk summarization and pass rates across
    participating CUs—difficult for generic KYC vendors to replicate.
    Additionally, a transparent, CU‑friendly pricing model aligned to
    application outcomes rather than opaque per‑query fees.
