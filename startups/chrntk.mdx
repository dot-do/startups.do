leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      New patient intake and consent paperwork take 10–20 minutes per new
      patient and 3–5 minutes per returning patient, tying up front-desk staff
      and causing bottlenecks at check-in.
    - >-
      Red-flag screening for musculoskeletal emergencies (e.g., cauda equina,
      cervical myelopathy, fracture, infection, malignancy, vascular
      emergencies) is inconsistent and often undocumented, creating clinical and
      liability risk.
    - >-
      Providers spend 4–10 minutes per visit writing SOAP notes; documentation
      backlogs reduce throughput and contribute to burnout.
    - >-
      Missing or incomplete documentation (e.g., objective findings,
      contraindications, informed consent) increases claim denials and audit
      risk, especially for PI/WC and insurance-heavy clinics.
    - >-
      Patient experience suffers from paper forms and repeated data entry;
      clinics lose referrals and repeat visits due to poor digital experience.
    - >-
      EHR intake features are generic; integrating multiple tools (forms, SMS,
      e-sign, AI scribe) is complex and costly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile-first, HIPAA-compliant digital intake with e-sign for consent, pain
      diagrams, PROs (e.g., NDI/ODI), insurance card capture, and identity
      validation.
    - >-
      Automated red-flag triage tailored to chiropractic scope with clear risk
      categories (immediate referral, same-day MD eval, proceed with caution)
      and documentation of decision rationale.
    - >-
      Pre-charted SOAP drafts using patient intake and past notes: subjective
      auto-summarized, objective templated with selectable ortho/neuro tests,
      assessment with ICD-10 suggestions, and plan templates including
      contraindications.
    - >-
      Seamless EHR integration (ChiroTouch, Jane, Cliniko, WebPT/Reach for
      cross-referrals) to write finalized notes, demographics, and documents
      back to the chart.
    - >-
      Multi-language support (EN/ES initially) and ADA-compliant patient flows
      via SMS/email with automated reminders and kiosk mode.
    - >-
      Audit trails, access controls, and PHI retention policies; BAAs and SOC 2
      Type II roadmap for enterprise buyers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Chiropractic practices that want to spend less time on paperwork and more
    time delivering care.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual/portal intake is slow, incomplete, and hard to triage;
    charting after visits eats time and increases risk. Internal: Teams feel
    overwhelmed and worry about missing red‑flags. Philosophical: Clinicians
    should focus on patients—not data entry.
  guide: >-
    We understand the documentation burden and safety risks in a busy
    chiropractic office. Our HIPAA-compliant AI, built with chiropractor input,
    flags red‑flag symptoms and drafts a clear SOAP note before the visit.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan: 1) Connect and customize: integrate with your workflow/EHR or
    use secure exports, tailor intake prompts. 2) Intake and triage: patients
    complete a secure form; AI structures history and flags red‑flags. 3)
    Pre‑chart review: provider opens a ready-to-review SOAP draft, edits, and
    signs. Agreement Plan: HIPAA BAA; encryption in transit and at rest;
    human-in-the-loop review before any note is finalized; explicit patient
    consent and data minimization.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 15‑minute demo. Transitional: Download a sample SOAP note and
    red‑flag checklist.
  success: >-
    - Dramatically less intake and charting time per patient. - Fewer missed
    red‑flag indicators and tighter compliance. - Shorter waits and smoother
    patient flow. - Cleaner, consistent SOAP notes ready before the visit. -
    Happier staff with less administrative burden and more time for care.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing paperwork bottlenecks and after-hours charting. - Risk of missed
    red‑flags and compliance exposure. - Longer patient wait times and staff
    burnout. - Lost revenue from inefficiency and inconsistent documentation.
