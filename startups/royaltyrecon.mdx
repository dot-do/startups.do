  title: Royalty Statement Normalization & Reconciliation
  description: >-
    Ingests DSP/PRO/MLC statements, normalizes schemas, matches to catalog,
    flags variances, and outputs accounting-ready files.
  targetUsers:
    - Royalty managers
    - Operations leads
    - Finance
  triggers:
    - Monthly/quarterly statement drop in SFTP/Drive

  risks:
    - Messy PDFs lead to parsing errors
    - False matches causing misallocations
    - Portal export format changes
    - Data security/compliance requirements
  dependencies:

    - 'FX rate source (e.g., CurrencyLayer)'
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Royalty data fragmentation: Publishers receive 50–300+ monthly files
      across DSPs/PROs/MLC in 30–80 different schemas (CSV, XLSX, CWR, DDEX ERN,
      PDFs), causing manual normalization and delayed close.
    - >-
      High manual workload: Mid-size publishers (50k–500k works) spend 2–6 FTEs
      on ingest, validation, and reconciliation; cycle times commonly 20–45 days
      post-statement.
    - >-
      Metadata inconsistency: Incomplete/incorrect ISWC/ISRC, alternate titles,
      abbreviations, and writer aliasing drive low match rates (70–85%) and
      missed collections.
    - >-
      Missed/underpaid royalties: 1–4% of gross royalties go uncollected or
      underpaid due to mapping errors, territorial splits, FX variances, and
      rate application mistakes.
    - >-
      Reconciliation complexity: Cross-source reconciliation (DSP vs. MLC vs.
      PRO) and monthly vs. quarterly timing creates blind spots; evidence packs
      for disputes are time-consuming to assemble.
    - >-
      Accounting handoff friction: Outputs rarely align with accounting systems
      (Vistex, Counterpoint, Music Maestro, Rightsline), creating rework and
      audit risk.
    - >-
      Scaling pain during catalog M&A: Backlog ingestion and retro claims for
      acquired catalogs can take 3–9 months without automation.
    - >-
      Limited line-of-business visibility: Leadership lacks near-real-time
      dashboards for match rates, unclaimed balances, variances by
      source/territory, and ROI on audits.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal ingestion layer for CSV/XLSX, CWR, DDEX ERN, XML, JSON, SFTP
      feeds, and portal-scraped PDFs using layout-aware OCR with schema
      inference.
    - >-
      Catalog matching using hybrid ML + rules: ISWC/ISRC/Title/Writer fuzzy
      match, alias resolution, territory/split logic, and confidence scoring
      with human-in-the-loop review queues.
    - >-
      Cross-source reconciliation: Compare DSP usage to MLC mechanicals and PRO
      performances by period, territory, work, and source; auto-calc expected
      vs. reported using rate cards and FX tables.
    - >-
      Variance detection and claims: Threshold- and rule-based variance flags;
      generate evidence packs (ledgers, contracts, usage, timestamped diffs) for
      disputes and audit workflows.
    - >-
      Accounting-ready outputs: Export to Vistex, Counterpoint, Music Maestro,
      Rightsline, NetSuite/Intacct via API/SFTP with chart-of-account mappings
      and dimensional tagging.
    - >-
      Backfile acceleration: High-throughput historical ingestion with
      de-duplication and retro-claim identification.
    - >-
      Quality feedback loop: Editorial operations layer to resolve edge cases;
      model retraining using publisher-confirmed decisions to continuously
      improve precision/recall.
    - >-
      Governance & security: Role-based access, immutable audit logs, PII
      minimization, SOC 2 roadmap, data residency options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single, AI-powered pipeline that ingests any DSP/PRO/MLC statement,
    auto-normalizes schemas, maps to your catalog with high-confidence entity
    resolution, reconciles cross-sources, flags variances with audit-grade
    evidence, and exports accounting-ready files—cutting close time from weeks
    to days and recovering 0.5–2% of gross royalties.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving reference graph and labeled dataset built from
    multi-publisher decisions and cross-source reconciliations, combined with
    deep integrations to royalty/accounting platforms and a claims evidence
    generator. Network effects improve match/recall and variance precision over
    time, reducing unit costs and increasing recovery accuracy in ways that are
    hard for new entrants to replicate.

    Villain: messy, inconsistent royalty statements from DSPs, PROs, and the
    MLC. External: fragmented schemas, missing IDs, duplicates, late reports,
    and mismatches. Internal: teams buried in spreadsheets, fearing
    under/overpayments and audit risk. Philosophical: creators deserve accurate,
    on-time royalties; publishers should grow catalogs, not clean data.

    Authority: AI-first reconciliation built on DDEX/CWR know-how, proven at
    million-line scales, with strong controls and clear audit trails.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect DSP/PRO/MLC feeds and your catalog/GL. 2) AI normalizes schemas,
    matches works/recordings, and flags variances with reasons. 3) Review
    exceptions, approve fixes, and export accounting-ready files and audit logs.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a demo or start a 30-day pilot. Transitional: download a sample
    variance report and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Clean, reconciled statements; faster month-end close; recovered missed
    revenue; 80%+ less manual work; fewer disputes; audit-ready transparency;
    scalable operations across catalogs and territories.
  failure: >-
