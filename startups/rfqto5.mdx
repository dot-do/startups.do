leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Transformer RFQs are complex (50–300+ page specs, drawings, datasheets)
      and take 3–15 business days to convert into a vetted quote.
    - >-
      Quoting is constrained by scarce application engineers; typical AE
      throughput is 5–20 power transformer RFQs per month or 50–200 distribution
      RFQs per month.
    - >-
      Manual parsing and spreadsheet-based costing lead to margin leakage (2–5%
      average vs. target) and compliance gaps that cause rework or penalties.
    - >-
      Supplier lead-time and price volatility (e.g., copper, GOES steel, OLTCs,
      bushings) are not systematically captured in quotes, causing missed
      delivery commitments and change orders.
    - >-
      Institutional knowledge is concentrated in a few experts; retirements and
      turnover increase risk and extend training times (6–18 months to ramp a
      new estimator).
    - >-
      Different plants, standards (IEEE/IEC), and customer templates cause
      inconsistency; no single source of truth for assumptions, deviations, and
      evaluated price (loss capitalization).
    - >-
      Slow quote turnaround reduces win rates in fast-moving tenders, especially
      framework agreements and utility mini-bids where speed and completeness
      are decisive.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize RFQs (PDF, Word, Excel, emails) and drawings; extract
      key parameters using a transformer-specific ontology (ratings, voltages,
      impedance, cooling, losses, sound, seismic, accessories, standards).
    - >-
      Generate a parametric baseline design and multi-option BOM (core,
      windings, tank, OLTC, bushings, radiators/fans/pumps, gauges, CTs/PTs,
      relays, gaskets, oil) with alternates (Al/Cu, ONAN/ONAF/ODAF, OLTC
      vendor).
    - >-
      Roll up costs with live commodity indices (copper, aluminum, GOES, oil),
      supplier catalogs and eRFQ pulls for long-lead items (bushings, OLTC), and
      calibrated labor/overhead models by plant.
    - >-
      Compute realistic lead times by combining supplier lead-time signals,
      plant capacity calendars (critical resources: winding lines,
      core-stacking, tank shop, test bay), and approval cycle assumptions.
    - >-
      Auto-build compliance and deviations matrix against IEEE/IEC and
      customer-specific clauses; flag risks and exceptions for human review.
    - >-
      Produce a complete, branded quote package: technical compliance, price and
      evaluated price (loss capitalization), lead time, deviations, drawings
      list, warranty, incoterms, logistics assumptions.
    - >-
      Integrate to CPQ/ERP/PLM (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Infor, Salesforce CPQ) for
      item master sync, part-numbering, and handoff to order engineering once
      won.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review with traceability: every datapoint links back to
      spec text, rule, or supplier source; version control and approval workflow
      included.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn transformer RFQs/specs into a vetted BOM, costed price, realistic lead
    time, and a complete quote package in 24–72 hours with ±3% cost accuracy,
    IEEE/IEC compliance traceability, and full auditability—tripling AE
    throughput while protecting margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A transformer-specific knowledge base (IEEE/IEC clause mapping, evaluated
    price logic, plant-calibrated parametric rules) trained on large volumes of
    historical RFQs, BOMs, and outcomes, combined with live supplier and
    commodity signals and human-in-the-loop guardrails that deliver traceable,
    auditable, and production-ready quotes—difficult to replicate without years
    of domain data and partnerships.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Sales, estimating, and engineering leaders at power, distribution, and
    specialty transformer manufacturers who must turn complex RFQs into accurate
    quotes fast—without burning out their teams.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as dense PDFs/specs/drawings and spreadsheets;
    building a compliant BOM, price, and lead time takes hours of tribal
    knowledge and cross-checks. Internal: slow, error‑prone quoting causes
    missed bid windows and margin leakage. Philosophical: expert teams should
    engineer better transformers—not copy‑paste specs.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to quote fast and right. Our team builds
    AI-assisted quoting for heavy electrical manufacturing; the Autopilot is
    transformer‑trained (MVA/kV, cooling classes, losses, impedance, tap
    changers, bushings) and applies your design/pricing rules with an auditable
    trail. Enterprise‑grade security and ERP/CPQ integrations keep IT
    comfortable.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect RFQ sources (email, portals) or drop PDFs/specs/drawings. 2)
    Autopilot extracts and validates requirements, generates a vetted BOM, and
    computes price and lead time using your rules and current costs/capacity. 3)
    You review, adjust margins, and export a complete quote pack (BOM, pricing,
    lead time, compliance notes, cover letter).
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 2‑week pilot with 3 recent RFQs. Not ready?
    Download a sample quote pack and ROI benchmark.
  success: >-
    Respond in hours, lift win rates, protect margins with consistent pricing,
    free engineering/estimating time, ensure compliance confidence, and build a
    searchable, audit‑ready quoting knowledge base.
  failure: >-
    Keep missing bid windows, scrambling through fire‑drills, leaking margin to
    errors and rework, and eroding customer trust with slow, inconsistent
    quotes.
