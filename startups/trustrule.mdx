  problem:
    - >-
      Trust and custody teams spend hours manually reading dense trust
      instruments and amendments to determine operative provisions (distribution
      standards, investment restrictions, trustee powers), creating delays in
      onboarding and changes in circumstance.
    - >-
      High operational risk: inconsistent interpretation across reviewers leads
      to breaches of trust terms, regulatory findings, and E&O exposure;
      exceptions are often detected only after transactions occur.
    - >-
      Fragmented amendments: downstream systems rarely reflect the latest
      amendments, creating outdated rules and manual workarounds.
    - >-
      Lack of machine-readable rules: current outputs are narrative memos or
      checklists, not structured rules that can drive automated checks and
      workflows.
    - >-
      Audit and regulatory pressure: regulators expect traceability from
      transaction decisions back to source instruments; current processes lack
      clause-level citations and audit trails.
    - >-
      Knowledge silos: institutional memory resides with a few senior
      administrators or counsel; turnover causes slow, error-prone reviews.
    - >-
      Scaling constraints: volume spikes (e.g., tax season, remediations) force
      costly overtime or outsourcing with variable quality.
    - >-
      Poor integration: clause interpretations don’t sync with trust accounting,
      custody, or workflow systems; duplicate data entry and reconciliation are
      common.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest trust instruments and all amendments (PDF, scanned, DOCX) with OCR
      and normalization; automatically detect document types and versions.
    - >-
      Extract and classify operative clauses (e.g., HEMS standards, invasion
      powers, distribution hierarchies, discretionary standards, investment
      restrictions, tax elections) with confidence scores and citations to
      page/section.
    - >-
      Map extracted clauses to a canonical trust rule ontology and generate a
      machine-readable rulebook (JSON/DSL) suitable for downstream systems.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI: reviewers confirm/adjust clauses and rules;
      changes propagate to the rulebook with tracked provenance.
    - >-
      Amendment and restatement handling: version control, intelligent diff, and
      automatic supersedence management to keep the operative rulebook current.
    - >-
      Rule simulation sandbox: test the rulebook against sample or historical
      transactions to validate outcomes and identify gaps before production.
    - >-
      Policy overlay: map firm policies/regulatory requirements to rulebook
      elements to highlight conflicts and required controls.
    - >-
      API and pre-built connectors to trust accounting, custody, and workflow
      engines to operationalize checks (e.g., pre-distribution eligibility
      checks, investment restriction compliance).
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring: alert when a new doc is added or when entity
      changes (e.g., beneficiary age, death, tax status) alter rule outcomes.
    - >-
      Comprehensive audit trail: every automated decision links back to the
      exact clause text, page, and version, with reviewer identity and
      timestamp.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From static trust documents to an auditable, machine-readable rulebook in
    minutes—powering automated fiduciary checks, faster onboarding, and
    demonstrably safer operations. Target outcomes (in pilots): 60–80% cycle
    time reduction, >95% clause extraction precision/recall on benchmarked
    classes, and 50–70% fewer downstream exceptions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vetted trust-specific rule ontology with clause-to-control mappings,
    trained on a large, curated corpus of real-world trust instruments and
    amendments; coupled with clause-level citation and amendment supersedence
    logic that produces regulator-ready audit trails. Deep integrations with
    trust accounting/workflow systems and a documented model risk framework
    lower enterprise adoption friction.

    Fiduciary operations leaders, trust officers, and custody teams who must
    interpret complex trust documents and run them consistently at scale.
  problem: >-
    External: Trust instruments and amendments are long, inconsistent, and
    trapped in PDFs—manual interpretation slows onboarding and creates
    compliance risk. Internal: Teams feel exposed and overworked, fearing missed
    clauses and audit findings. Philosophical: Beneficiaries deserve accurate,
    timely administration and rules should be clear and executable.
  guide: >-

    regulator and auditor scrutiny, and we’ve built for it. Our AI, trained with
    fiduciary expertise and proven on real instruments, delivers audit-ready
    outputs with security and controls your risk team can back.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Securely ingest instruments and amendments; 2) Extract operative
    clauses and normalize terms; 3) Generate a machine-readable rulebook mapped
    to your fiduciary controls and workflow systems; 4) Human
    review-and-approve; 5) Continuous updates as documents change. Agreement:
    Your data stays governed, with versioning, traceability, and
    human-in-the-loop approval.
