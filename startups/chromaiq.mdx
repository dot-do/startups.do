  problem:
    - >-
      Commercial printers lose margin to reprints and make-ready chasing brand
      colors across mixed fleets (offset + digital + inkjet).
    - >-
      Manual spot-to-CMYK conversion is inconsistent; RIP defaults ignore
      press/substrate realities, causing deltaE00 > 2–4 for many brand colors.
    - >-
      Prepress teams lack a fast, device-aware way to predict if a device can
      hit a color before committing to press time and ink.
    - >-
      Proof approval cycles are slow: customers see unexpected color shifts when
      moving jobs between devices/substrates.
    - >-
      Current tools are complex, siloed, and require deep color expertise not
      available in many mid-sized shops.
    - >-
      There is no lightweight, API-first service to simulate device color,
      recommend optimal spot conversions, and produce auditable deltaE
      reports/soft proofs at job scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven device simulation: predict achievable color on a given
      device/substrate/ink/press condition using ICC/ISO references plus
      device-specific characterization.
    - >-
      Spot-to-CMYK conversion recommendations: per-device optimized builds
      respecting TAC/ink cost/overprint and meeting target deltaE00 thresholds.
    - >-
      Automated deltaE reporting: job- and color-level CIEDE2000 metrics with
      pass/fail against configurable brand/ISO tolerances (e.g., <=2.0 avg,
      <=3.0 max).
    - >-
      Soft proof generation: PDF/X-4 proofs with correct output intent and
      simulation of paper white, overprints, and transparency; viewer guidance
      for Acrobat/Esko/GMG.
    - >-
      Press-readiness checker: flags unprintable colors vs target, suggests
      alternate substrates/devices or relaxed tolerances with quantified impact.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest measurement data (CxF/X-4, CGATS) from
      X-Rite/Techkon/Barbieri to continuously refine device models.
    - >-
      APIs/connectors: integrate with RIPs (EFI Fiery, HP Indigo DFE, Kodak
      Prinergy, Agfa Apogee, Esko), MIS/ERP (PrintIQ, Avanti), and preflight
      (callas pdfToolbox).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit brand colors first time, every time—AI-driven spot-to-CMYK mapping and
    device simulation that reduces reprints, speeds approvals, and proves
    compliance with automated deltaE reporting and soft proofs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from real production measurements across diverse
    devices/substrates enables per-device, per-condition spot mapping that
    consistently outperforms static libraries and RIP defaults; growing
    proprietary spectral dataset and OEM integrations create defensible network
    effects.

  character: >-
    Prepress managers, color leads, and production owners at commercial print
    shops (NAICS 323111) who must hit brand colors and convert spot to CMYK
    predictably across devices and stocks.
  problem: >-
    External: Multiple presses, substrates, and RIPs make spot-to-CMYK mapping
    inconsistent. Internal: Teams fear reprints, make-goods, and subjective
    approvals. Philosophical: Color shouldn’t be guesswork—proofs should match
    press with measurable deltaE.
  guide: >-
    We get that color tolerances are unforgiving. Our G7-/FOGRA-informed AI
    simulates your devices from ICC/measurement data, recommends the best CMYK
    recipes per device/stock, and outputs deltaE00 reports and press-ready soft
    proofs—so you can prove color before you print.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload ICC profiles/measurement data and spot/brand libraries. 2) Select
    device and substrate to simulate color; receive ranked CMYK recipes with
    predicted dE00. 3) Approve soft proof and export deltaE report; push recipes
    as device links/named-color tables to your RIP/DFE. 4) Monitor results and
    refine with feedback for locked-in consistency.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial or book a 20‑minute demo. Transitional: Download
    a sample deltaE report and soft proof using your colors.
  success: >-
    First-pass approvals, less waste and rework, predictable brand color across
    devices, documented compliance (GRACoL/FOGRA/ISO), faster prepress cycles,
    happier clients, and higher margins.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing recipes, fighting color drift, burning press time on
    make-readies, missing deadlines, and losing brand trust to competitors who
    can prove color.
