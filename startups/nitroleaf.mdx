  problem:
    - >-
      Smallholder and enterprise rice farmers often over- or under-apply
      nitrogen (N), causing 10–30% avoidable fertilizer cost and 0.2–0.5 t/ha
      yield losses due to timing/mis-dosing.
    - >-
      Existing tools (leaf color charts, SPAD meters) are accurate but
      impractical at scale: require hardware, training, and are slow to deploy
      at farmer level.
    - >-
      Advisory services rarely align N recommendations to actual crop growth
      stages and real-time crop status, leading to blanket rates and
      inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Variable lighting, variety differences, and field heterogeneity make
      visual diagnosis unreliable without AI calibration.
    - >-
      Retailers and co-ops lack simple, scalable ways to quantify N response and
      demonstrate ROI to farmers.
    - >-
      Policy and sustainability programs seek measurable N-use efficiency and
      N2O reductions but lack low-cost, verifiable field-level data.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app guides farmer to photograph the topmost fully expanded leaf; AI
      estimates nitrogen status relative to variety/growth stage.
    - >-
      App determines current growth stage (e.g., early tillering, active
      tillering, panicle initiation, booting) via phenology prompts and image
      cues.
    - >-
      Delivers split-application guidance in kg N/ha and in local fertilizer
      product equivalents (e.g., urea kg/acre), timed to stages and irrigation
      schedules.
    - >-
      Notifications/calendar ensure 3–4 split applications are planned and
      verified via follow-up scans; adapts future doses based on adherence and
      response.
    - >-
      Offline-first capture with on-device pre-screen for image quality; cloud
      or edge inference as bandwidth allows.
    - >-
      Localized advisory in local languages, with voice prompts and visual cues;
      integrates weather and field conditions (flooded/DSR) to optimize timing.
    - >-
      Co-op/enterprise dashboard to track adoption, scan results, recommended vs
      applied, N saved, and yield outcomes at block and farm level.
    - >-
      Benchmarking and reports for sustainability programs (NUE, N2O proxy) and
      potential carbon credit MRV pilots.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Smartphone imaging that translates rice leaf photos into precise,
    growth-stage-aligned split-N recommendations—cutting N costs by 10–25% while

  character: >-
    Rice growers who want confident, data-driven nitrogen decisions at each
    growth stage.
  problem: >-
    Nitrogen decisions feel like guesswork—variable fields, weather swings, and
    delayed lab data cause over/under-application, wasted spend, lodging, and
    runoff.
  guide: >-
    A smartphone AI that reads leaf images, identifies rice growth stage, and
    turns results into clear split-application guidance—field-validated and
    agronomist-backed, built for real farm conditions.
  plan: >-
    1) Snap a representative leaf photo. 2) Get stage-aware N status, rate, and
    timing. 3) Apply the split and re-scan at the next stage to fine-tune.
  callToAction: >-
    Download the app to run a free baseline scan today; or book a 10-minute
    onboarding.
  success: >-
    Consistent yields with fewer inputs, stable panicle density and protein,
    lower N costs, reduced lodging and passes, and a season-long, auditable
    stewardship log.
  failure: >-
    Missed yield, wasted urea, lodging, nitrate runoff, higher emissions, and
    preventable compliance issues.

    - Smartphone AI reads leaf nitrogen in seconds from a photo.
    - Automatically detects rice growth stage to align splits.
    - Delivers field-specific N dose (kg/ha) and timing windows.
    - Adjusts recommendations with each new reading and field notes.
    - Simple reminders and records for every split application.
    - Works offline in the field; syncs when connected.
  features:
    - Instant leaf N status from a single photo
    - Growth-stage detection (tillering to heading)
    - Split-application planner with rate and timing windows
    - Localized dose recommendations (kg N/ha)
    - Variety- and region-tuned models
    - Geo-tagged field logs with photos
    - Reminders and threshold alerts
    - Offline capture; low-bandwidth sync
