  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error‑prone label/formula reviews consume 4–12 hours per SKU
      across R&D, QA, and Regulatory teams, creating launch bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Frequent rule changes across FDA (US), CFIA (Canada), and EU FIC/1169/2011
      drive rework; small teams struggle to track updates, leading to outdated
      labels.
    - >-
      Ingredient naming inconsistencies and supplier spec variability (e.g.,
      spice synonyms, carriers, extracts) cause incorrect ingredient statements
      and allergen omissions.
    - >-
      Nutrition panel calculations and exemptions are misapplied, especially for
      seasoning blends vs. single spices, raising enforcement risk.
    - >-
      Claims (e.g., natural, no MSG, gluten‑free, organic, non‑GMO) are used
      without substantiation or jurisdiction‑specific qualifiers.
    - >-
      Documentation burden (specs, audit trails, bilingual CFIA labels,
      multi‑language EU labels) increases compliance cost and cycle time.
    - >-
      Regulatory mistakes can trigger recalls, import holds, chargebacks, and
      retailer delistings; a single corrective action can exceed $50,000 in
      direct costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or integrate formulas and draft labels; system normalizes
      ingredient names to compliant nomenclature (FDA/CFIA/EU) and maps
      allergens.
    - >-
      Automated rules engine checks claims, statement order/formatting, QUID
      (EU), bilingual CFIA requirements, and exemption eligibility.
    - >-
      Generates compliant ingredient statements, multi‑jurisdiction nutrition
      facts panels, and label copy in English/French (CFIA) and EU languages.
    - >-
      Flags non‑compliant elements with citations to specific
      regulations/guidance and provides fix‑it suggestions.
    - >-
      Maintains an audit trail and version control for regulatory sign‑off;
      exports printer‑ready text blocks and specs for artwork teams.
    - >-
      Continuous rule updates and supplier spec ingestion (COAs, tech sheets) to
      keep labels current; API/flat‑file integration with PLM/ERP.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI‑driven, jurisdiction‑aware label and formula compliance with automated
    ingredient statements and nutrition panels—cut review time by 60–80%,
    increase first‑pass approval rate to 95%+, and reduce recall and retailer
    penalty risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain‑specific compliance knowledge graph for spices/extracts (including
    synonym resolution, extract/oleoresin handling, carriers, and
    region‑specific naming) trained on proprietary annotated data and validated
    with industry partners; combined with rapid rule‑update pipelines and
    PLM/ERP integrations that embed checks directly into existing R&D/QA
    workflows. Early lighthouse deployments create defensible datasets and
    feedback loops that general tools lack.
