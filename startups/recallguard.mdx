leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Regulatory signal overload: QA/Regulatory teams must track dozens of
      sources (FDA/CVM, Safety Reporting Portal signals, state feed control
      bulletins, EU RASFF for imported ingredients, veterinary forums, consumer
      reviews, social media), causing 1–3 day delays in awareness.
    - >-
      Hard-to-map signals: Public alerts rarely mention your SKU or exact
      supplier names/lot codes; correlating to internal
      SKUs/ingredients/suppliers is manual and takes 4–12 hours per incident.
    - >-
      Slow response/CAPA authoring: Drafting recall communications, adverse
      event narratives, root-cause analysis, and CAPA packages for FSMA PCAF (21
      CFR Part 507), BRCGS Pet Food, and SQF audits consumes 10–20 staff-hours
      per event.
    - >-
      Costly misses: Dozens of pet food recalls and public alerts occur annually
      in the US; even a Class II recall can cost $1–5M in direct costs
      (disposal, backhaul, overtime, testing) excluding reputational damage.
    - >-
      Audit-readiness gaps: Demonstrating continuous surveillance, hazard
      analysis updates, and CAPA linkage is inconsistent, risking
      non-conformances and corrective actions in GFSI audits.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified monitoring of FDA/CVM enforcement reports and recall listings,
      Safety Reporting Portal signals, state feed control bulletins, EU RASFF
      notices (for imported ingredients), veterinary communities, consumer
      reviews, and social media for pet food–relevant issues.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and knowledge graph: Maps external signals to your
      SKUs/ingredient statements/suppliers/lot codes via an ontology of pet food
      ingredients and supplier aliases; flags potential exposure with confidence
      scoring.
    - >-
      Auto-drafted response and CAPA: Generates incident assessments,
      regulator/customer communications, recall checklists, root cause
      hypotheses, and CAPA templates aligned to FSMA Part 507, BRCGS Pet Food,
      and SQF requirements.
    - >-
      Workflow and integrations: Push tasks and evidence to ERP/PLM/LIMS for lot
      genealogy (e.g., SAP, NetSuite, TraceGains), ticketing (Jira/ServiceNow),
      and document control (SharePoint/Veeva).
    - >-
      Audit trail and simulations: Time-stamped evidence of surveillance and
      CAPA linkage; run mock recalls/tabletop exercises and produce audit-ready
      reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Know within minutes if any regulatory, media, or social signal could
    implicate your pet food SKUs, ingredients, or suppliers, and ship an
    audit-ready response/CAPA package in hours instead of days—reducing recall
    risk, response time, and compliance burden under FSMA PCAF, BRCGS Pet Food,
    and SQF.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A pet food–specific knowledge graph and labeled dataset of recalls/adverse
    events and supplier/ingredient aliases, combined with prebuilt GFSI-aligned
    CAPA templates and ERP/PLM/LIMS integrations, enabling high-accuracy mapping
    and immediate audit-ready outputs that generalist tools and manual workflows
    cannot match.

  problem: >-
    External: Recall and adverse-event signals are scattered across FDA/CVM,
    state portals, vet/media/social channels and change fast—manual monitoring
    misses things. Internal: Teams worry about waking up to a crisis,
    firefighting without clear mapping to their own SKUs and ingredients.

  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import SKUs, ingredients, suppliers, and plants; set
    roles/notifications. 2) Configure: Define watchlists, thresholds, and
    jurisdictions; ingest historical recalls for context. 3) Act: Receive
