leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Daily production planning is manual and inconsistent; managers spend
      45–120 minutes each evening building make sheets with limited data,
      leading to over/under‑production.
    - >-
      Perishable bakery SKUs face volatile, hyper‑local demand (day‑of‑week,
      weather, holidays, events) that simple heuristics can’t capture.
    - >-
      Waste and markdowns on fresh bakery items commonly run 8–15% of production
      value; stock‑outs cause lost sales and lower customer satisfaction.
    - >-
      Multi‑store operators lack standardized planning; results vary by manager
      and shift, making training and scaling hard.
    - >-
      Existing POS forecasts rarely incorporate shelf life, batch sizes,
      proof/bake lead times, or target service levels by time window.
    - >-
      Owners lack clear, trusted KPIs tying planning decisions to gross margin,
      waste, and service level outcomes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect POS, inventory, and calendar/weather data to produce SKU‑level,
      next‑day demand forecasts by time window.
    - >-
      Optimize a make sheet that meets target service levels while minimizing
      expected leftovers, respecting shelf life, proof/bake times, batch sizes,
      and labor windows.
    - >-
      Provide simple acceptance/edit workflow; learn from overrides and next‑day
      outcomes to continuously improve.
    - >-
      Track waste/markdowns and stock‑outs; quantify savings and margin impact;
      standardize across locations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut fresh bakery waste by 20–40% while achieving 98%+ service levels, with a
    make sheet generated in under 5 minutes per day—using your existing POS data
    and zero new hardware.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, normalized, cross‑operator dataset of bakery‑specific SKU demand
    and waste—combined with an optimization engine tuned to shelf‑life and
    production constraints—enables faster, more accurate recommendations than
    generic restaurant tools or POS heuristics. Learning from manager overrides
    across many locations compounds accuracy over time.
  customerSegments:
