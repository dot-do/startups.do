leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual QA and incident reviews are slow and inconsistent: pulling,
      scrubbing, and listening to hours of audio for a 5–10 minute event
      commonly takes 2–6 hours per case.
    - >-
      Supervisors can’t search historic comms by callsign, sector, runway, or
      procedure; knowledge is lost when recordings roll off retention.
    - >-
      Training content creation is ad hoc; finding good examples of
      proper/incorrect phraseology, late readbacks, and non-standard clearances
      takes days.
    - >-
      Existing speech-to-text tools perform poorly on noisy VHF/ HF, clipped
      transmissions, and ATC phraseology (high WER, missed callsigns).
    - >-
      Safety teams lack measurable, automated readback/clearance compliance
      indicators; trend analysis is manual and delayed.
    - >-
      Integration friction: recorder systems store “non-operational copies” but
      analytics are siloed and not tailored to ATC events (handoffs,
      deviations).
  solution:
    - >-
      Domain-tuned ASR for ATC comms: noise-robust transcription optimized for
      VHF/HF bandwidth and phraseology (SIDs/STARs, runway/taxiway, altitudes,
      QNH, callsign formats).
    - >-
      Event tagging engine: detects and links clearance issuance, readback,
      handoff, non-standard phraseology, and deviation indicators; computes
      readback/clearance match scores.
    - >-
      Entity extraction: callsigns (ICAO/IATA + flight number variations),
      runway/taxiway identifiers, sectors/frequencies, altitudes, waypoints, and
      procedures.
    - >-
      Diarization + role inference: controller vs pilot segmentation using
      PTT/VCS metadata when available, or acoustic heuristics where not.
    - >-
      Search and case building: query by callsign, time range, sector/frequency,
      runway, event type; export synchronized audio clips, transcripts, and tag
      timelines for investigations/training.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors for common ATC recorders (Eventide NexLog, NICE
      Inform, Verint), VCS (Frequentis, Rohde & Schwarz), and safety/QA tools
      (SMS portals, ECCAIRS2) via secure APIs.
    - >-
      Privacy and security: works on non-operational copies; role-based access;
      on-premises or FedRAMP/GovCloud deployment; configurable retention
      matching ANSP policy.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboards: facility-level KPIs (e.g., readback compliance rate,
      time-to-handoff, phraseology variance) with trends by sector/time of
      day/weather.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn hours of ATC audio into searchable, tagged events in minutes:
    high-accuracy ATC-tuned transcription and auto-tagging of callsigns,
    clearances, readbacks, handoffs, and deviations for QA, safety, and training
    — deployable on-prem or GovCloud, integrated with leading voice recorders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, event-annotated ATC audio corpus and models
    explicitly tuned for ATC phraseology and noisy VHF/HF — coupled with
    certified connectors to the major recorder/VCS platforms and a demonstrated
    KPI playbook (measured QA time savings, compliance trends) from
    design-partner facilities.

    ATC facility leaders and QA training teams who need fast accurate insight
    from recorded frequencies
  problem: >-
    Manual audio review is slow and error prone, key events can be missed,
    investigations and training stall, leaders need defensible searchable
