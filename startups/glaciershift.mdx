leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High demand charges from compressor starts and coincident peaks increase
      bills 20–40% despite stable annual kWh.
    - >-
      Manual scheduling doesn’t account for tariffs, DR events, weather, or
      order variability; operators lack decision support at shift change.
    - >-
      Defrost cycles are mistimed, causing demand spikes, lost production hours,
      and thermal inefficiency.
    - >-
      Ice inventory decisions (produce now vs. melt later) aren’t tied to energy
      price signals, leading to overproduction or stockouts.
    - >-
      Utilities’ DR participation (enrollment, telemetry, baseline/M&V) is
      complex; plants miss revenue or face penalties for underperformance.
    - >-
      Existing PLC/SCADA controls maintain setpoints but don’t optimize for
      cost; setpoints are static and vendor-specific.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into cost/throughput KPIs (kWh/ton, $/ton, peak kW,
      run-hours) hinders continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Staffing constraints mean no dedicated energy analyst; savings
      opportunities are lost daily.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plant digital twin of compressors, evaporators, storage bins, and
      constraints (min-on/off, suction/discharge limits, sanitation windows).
    - >-
      Optimization engine (mixed-integer linear programming) generating 24–48h
      day-ahead schedules at 5–15 min granularity, with intraday re-optimization
      every 15–60 minutes.
    - >-
      Forecasting of ambient temperature, melt rates, production orders, and
      electricity prices/DR events; learns seasonal patterns.
    - >-
      Closed-loop control via PLC/SCADA (Modbus/BACnet/OPC UA) to stage
      compressors, schedule defrost, and manage ice charging/discharging; safe
      interlocks and manual override.
    - >-
      DR integration (OpenADR 2.0b or aggregator APIs) with automated baseline
      calculation, telemetry, and underperformance protection; event response
      <60 seconds.
    - >-
      Real-time KPI dashboards (kWh/ton, $/ton, peak kW, inventory hours of
      cover) and ISO-compliant M&V to verify savings.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection (e.g., rising kWh/ton, short cycling, valve issues) and
      maintenance-aware scheduling to balance run-hours.
    - >-
      OT gateway with secure, store-and-forward messaging; fail-safe reverts to
      last safe schedule if connectivity is lost.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce ice plant energy cost 15–30% and earn $15–50/kW-year in DR revenue by
    automatically scheduling compressors, defrost, and ice inventory against
    tariffs and events—while guaranteeing production targets and providing
    audit-ready M&V.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ice manufacturing plant operators and energy managers who must hit daily ice
    production targets at the lowest possible energy cost.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile tariffs, demand charges, DR events, and rigid/manual
    scheduling. Internal: constant worry about stockouts, blown budgets, and
    after-hours alarms. Philosophical: making ice shouldn’t force you to
    overspend on energy or compromise reliability.
  guide: >-
    We understand industrial refrigeration and grid programs. Our team blends
    plant operations, ML optimization, and tariff/DR expertise, translating your
    real constraints (production, inventory, equipment limits) into a schedule
    you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: meters, compressor/evaporator data, ice inventory, tariffs and
    DR feeds. 2) Optimize: AI schedules compressor/defrost cycles and inventory
    draw to meet targets while avoiding peaks; you review and approve. 3)
    Orchestrate: push setpoints/alerts to PLC/SCADA, adapt in real time, and
    receive weekly performance reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30-day pilot at one plant. Transitional: Get a free
    tariff/DR opportunity assessment and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Lower energy bills and peak demand, capture DR revenue, maintain 100% of
    required ice availability, smooth equipment cycles for longer life, cut
    emissions, and gain audit-ready transparency across every event and shift.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you keep paying peak tariffs and demand charges, miss DR
    payouts, scramble during events, risk stockouts or overproduction, stress
    equipment with erratic cycling, and keep firefighting with spreadsheets.
