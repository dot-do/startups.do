  problem:
    - >-
      Slow speed-to-lead: 40–60% of builder web/form leads receive first
      response after 10+ minutes or not at all, causing 8–15% lower contact and
      appointment rates
    - >-
      No after-hours coverage: 55–70% of inquiries arrive outside 9–5; most
      builders lack 24/7 response, leaking high-intent traffic to competitors
    - >-
      Inconsistent qualification and scripting across OSCs leads to poor data
      hygiene in CRM (missing budget/timeline/location; 20–35% duplicate or
      incomplete records)
    - >-
      Manual appointment coordination across communities and sales teams drives
      friction (no-shows, double-bookings, and poor calendar utilization)
    - >-
      High cost per kept appointment using human-only OSC or outsourced ISAs
      ($120–$300 per kept appt) with volatile quality and limited scalability
    - >-
      Fragmented channel handling (web chat, forms, SMS, FB/IG lead ads, phone)
      results in untracked conversations and poor attribution
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on concierge: inbound triage across web forms, chat widgets, SMS,
      Facebook/Instagram lead ads, and tracked phone numbers with sub-60s first
      response
    - >-
      Structured qualification: collects budget, timeline, location/community
      preference, household needs, financing status, and contact preferences;
      enforces required CRM fields
    - >-
      Real-time FAQs: incentives, HOA/amenities, floor plans, lot availability
      windows, school districts, commute times, warranty—kept current via
      CMS/feeds
    - >-
      Automatic scheduling: checks builder calendars by community/sales agent,
      books in-person or virtual tours, sends confirmations and reminders,
      manages reschedules/cancellations
    - >-
      Smart routing and escalation: detects hot leads and patches to live
      OSC/agent, or schedules callbacks; de-duplicates and merges with existing
      CRM contacts
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: TCPA consent capture and logging, fair-housing
      guardrails, language accessibility (EN/ES), audit trails of all messages
      and calls
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 AI OSC that responds in under 60 seconds across web, SMS, voice, and
    social; qualifies, answers builder-specific FAQs, and books model or virtual
    tours directly to the correct community calendar—cutting cost per kept
    appointment by 30–50% while improving CRM hygiene and after-hours coverage
    to 100%.
