leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Most small arms ammunition plants rely on spreadsheets and paper travelers
      for lot traceability, creating gaps when lots are split, merged, reworked,
      or repackaged.
    - >-
      When a defect is detected (e.g., pressure variance, primer misfires),
      isolating all affected finished goods and customers takes days to weeks,
      leading to broader-than-necessary recalls and revenue loss.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MES traceability does not model ammunition-specific genealogy
      (powder blends, primer cups/anvils mixes, case draws, bullet
      jackets/cores) and lacks intelligent suspect-lot propagation.
    - >-
      Quality, regulatory, and defense customers expect rapid containment and
      documented genealogy (ISO 9001 traceability, SAAMI recall guidance,
      MIL-STD-1168 for lot numbering), but assembling compliant recall
      documentation is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Defect detection is reactive and siloed; QC ballistic test data, field
      returns, and supplier COAs are not fused for early warning.
    - >-
      Insurers and defense buyers increasingly require demonstrable recall
      readiness and periodic drills; most plants cannot generate a complete
      recall package within hours.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ammunition-specific genealogy engine that models lot splits/merges/rework
      across cases, bullets, primers, and powder blends; auto-links to finished
      SKUs, pallets, and shipments.
    - >-
      Real-time suspect-lot detection using AI that fuses QC ballistic data
      (velocity/pressure), in-process SPC, supplier COAs, and field returns;
      auto-propagates risk through the genealogy graph.
    - >-
      One-click recall dossier assembly: affected lots/SKUs/customers,
      containment pick-lists, quarantine instructions, notification templates,
      and evidence binder (test results, travelers, signoffs).
    - >-
      Integrations with common ERP/MES/LIMS/barcode/RFID/vision systems to
      ingest and reconcile data without replacing existing systems.
    - >-
      Recall simulation drills and scorecards; scheduled exercises with
      pass/fail criteria and improvement actions.
    - >-
      Edge gateway for air-gapped/defense lines; offline data buffering with
      cryptographic audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create complete, ammunition-specific lot genealogy across raw materials,
    in-process transformations, and finished goods; continuously monitor for
    suspect lots; and generate a complete, audit-ready recall package in under
    15 minutes—reducing recall scope, cost, and risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical AI plus a purpose-built genealogy graph for ammunition processes,
    pre-built integrations to common plant systems, and a proven recall playbook
    that meets defense and commercial expectations—enabling a measurable SLA for
    recall dossier assembly that horizontal MES/QMS vendors cannot credibly
    offer.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid- to large-volume metallic cartridge manufacturers (pistol, rifle,
      shotshell) producing >20M rounds/year.
    - >-
