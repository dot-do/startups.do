  problem:
    - >-
      SDS and GHS label authoring for complex mixtures (solvent-, water-based,
      UV/EB inks) is slow and manual: 8–16 hours per new SKU across regions and
      languages, creating launch delays and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Supplier SDS changes (classification, cut-off limits, impurities)
      propagate slowly; mixture reclassification often lags by weeks, risking
      mislabeling and CLP/OSHA noncompliance.
    - >-
      Regional divergence and frequent updates (EU CLP ATPs, UK-CLP, REACH Annex
      II, OSHA HazCom 2012/2024 updates, WHMIS 2015/2022, Brazil ABNT NBR
      14725:2023, Mexico NOM-018-STPS-2015, Japan JIS Z 7253, China GB/T 17519)
      make maintaining multi-market SDS/labels difficult.
    - >-
      Inconsistent label content (pictograms, GHS signal word, H/P phrases,
      supplemental info, Prop 65, VOC declarations) and transport
      classifications (UN numbers, packing group) lead to costly reprints and
      audit findings.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows: rekeying between ERP/PLM and label design tools
      causes errors; limited audit trail/versioning complicates customer and
      regulator inquiries.
    - >-
      High fixed costs: 1–3 FTE product stewardship staff plus legacy software;
      small and mid-size ink makers lack the scale to justify enterprise EHS
      suites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest formulations (CAS, wt%, impurities, additives) securely from
      ERP/PLM/Excel and map to a normalized substance master.
    - >-
      AI parses supplier SDS PDFs to structured data (hazard classes,
      concentration ranges, cut-offs, notes M, SCLs, impurities) with
      human-in-the-loop validation where needed.
    - >-
      Rules engine computes mixture classification per jurisdiction
      (OSHA/CLP/WHMIS/JIS/GB), transport (ADR/IMDG/IATA), and supplemental local
      requirements (Prop 65, VOC).
    - >-
      Generate SDS automatically (Annex II 16-section, HazCom, WHMIS) with
      correct H/P phrases, EUH statements, exposure/transport sections;
      multi-language from validated phrase libraries.
    - >-
      Generate compliant GHS labels and print files; auto-select
      pictograms/signal word, create regulatory and customer-specific templates,
      and embed barcodes/UFIs.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring for supplier SDS updates; auto-reclassify impacted
      mixtures, flag changes, route for internal approval, and re-issue
      SDS/labels with versioning.
    - >-
      PCN/UFI support for EU (compute UFI, maintain mixture composition
      windows), and controlled distribution of SDS to customers with receipt
      tracking.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to SAP, Infor M3, Microsoft Dynamics, Datacor/Chempax,
      Deacom, BatchMaster; label print connectors to BarTender and NiceLabel.
    - >-
      Full audit trail and change log; comparison reports showing what changed
      (phrases, classifications, sections) and why.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vertical AI for ink manufacturers that automatically classifies mixtures
    from formulations and supplier SDS, then generates region-ready SDS and GHS
    labels in 30+ languages—cutting authoring time by 80%, reducing update lag
    to under 48 hours, and achieving >99% compliance accuracy with full audit
    trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization: pre-trained AI and rules specifically tuned for
    printing ink chemistries, plus a shared supplier SDS update network that
    propagates changes across customers. Prebuilt ERP/label integrations and
    validated phrase/template libraries reduce time-to-value to weeks vs. months
    for generalist tools.

    Regulatory/EHS managers and formulation teams at ink manufacturers (NAICS
    325910) who need accurate, multi-region SDS and GHS labels for complex
    solvent- and waterborne inks.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual, spreadsheet-heavy SDS/label creation across OSHA HazCom,
    WHMIS, EU/UK CLP is slow and error-prone as supplier SDS and formulas
    change. Internal: Teams worry about missed updates, translations, and
    shipment deadlines. Philosophical: Compliance shouldn’t slow innovation or
    risk worker safety.

    We understand ink chemistries and global regs; our team blends regulatory
    experts and formulation chemists. Our AI rule engine stays current with
    GHS/CLP updates to classify mixtures and generate compliant SDS and labels
    with audit-ready traceability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect formulations and supplier SDS (CSV/API/PLM-ERP). 2) Select
    regions, languages, and templates; auto-classify hazards and generate
    SDS/labels. 3) Review and approve; publish and auto-update when inputs or
    regulations change.

    consistent multilingual labels, clean audits with version control, and
    turnaround reduced from weeks to hours with lower compliance risk.
  failure: >-
    Avoid fines, shipment holds, customer rejects, rework, and safety incidents
    from outdated or inconsistent SDS and labels.
