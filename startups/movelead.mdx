leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow first response: many movers reply in hours, not seconds; 40–60% of
      inbound inquiries come after-hours or on weekends and go unanswered until
      the next business day.
    - >-
      Leakage between channels: calls, website forms, chat, SMS,
      Facebook/WhatsApp messages, and Google Business Messages are fragmented;
      leads fall through the cracks.
    - >-
      Inconsistent qualification: staff collect incomplete information
      (inventory, access constraints, dates, origin/destination), leading to
      misquotes, unprofitable jobs, and no-shows.
    - >-
      Friction scheduling surveys: back-and-forth to find a time; missed
      confirmations and reminders cause 15–25% survey no-shows.
    - >-
      Price opacity: prospects want a quick range to decide; reps hesitate to
      estimate without a full survey, causing drop-off.
    - >-
      High labor costs: reception/inside sales coverage for 24/7 is expensive;
      outsourcing is inconsistent in quality.
    - >-
      Poor analytics: owners lack visibility into lead-to-booked-job funnel,
      cost per qualified lead, and after-hours ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel AI agent for chat, SMS, voice, and social messaging; greets,
      qualifies, and follows up automatically.
    - >-
      Structured qualification flow tailored to moving: move date,
      origin/destination, floors/elevators, parking, stairs, special items,
      packing needs, insurance/COI, time windows.
    - >-
      Instant price range estimate using distance, inventory-size heuristics,
      and mover-specific pricing rules (hourly local vs. weight/mileage for
      long-distance) with clear disclaimers.
    - >-
      Calendar integration to book virtual video surveys or onsite surveys;
      automated confirmations, reminders, rescheduling, and pre-checklists to
      reduce no-shows.
    - >-
      Voice agent for inbound phone routing after-hours or overflow;
      voicemail-to-text with instant follow-up when needed.
    - >-
      CRM integration to create/update leads, attach transcripts, and push
      tasks/quotes; deduplication across channels.
    - >-
      Lead recovery automations: nurture sequences for unresponsive prospects
      via SMS/email; abandoned chat re-engagement.
    - >-
      Owner dashboard with funnel analytics, attribution by channel, after-hours
      impact, and A/B testing of scripts and offers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 AI that answers every lead in seconds, qualifies with mover-grade
    rigor, gives a realistic price range, and books a virtual or onsite survey
    directly on your calendar—lifting conversions 20–40% while cutting
    after-hours leakage and labor costs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization and data network effects: a growing corpus of
    moving-specific interactions, successful estimate bands, and show-rate
    tactics trains better intent classification, estimation accuracy, and
    objection handling than general-purpose bots or outsourced receptionists.
    Deep integrations with moving CRMs and calendars, plus compliance-by-design
    workflows, create switching costs and defensibility.

      capture, and pre-survey vetting.
    - >-
      Moving brokers and lead aggregators who must quickly qualify and route
      leads to network partners.
    - >-
      Vertical CRMs and booking platforms serving movers that want embedded AI
      lead capture as an add-on.
