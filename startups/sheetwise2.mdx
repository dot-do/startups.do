  title: Smart Imposition & Ganging Optimizer
  description: >-
    Minimize waste and clicks by imposing/ganging compatible jobs and generating
    press‑ready imposed PDFs.
  targetUsers:
    - Prepress managers
    - Production planners
  triggers:
    - Batch of jobs reaches threshold
    - Scheduled nightly ganging run
    - Manual request for a specific press/sheet size
  inputs:
    - Individual job PDFs
    - 'Sheet/press constraints (sheet size, gripper, margins)'
    - Bleed/creep/trims
    - Due dates/priority
  steps:
    - Preflight to confirm sizes/bleeds
    - Solve for optimal imposition/ganging to reduce waste and changeovers
    - Add crop/registration/color bars/barcodes
    - Export imposed PDF + layout map; optional JDF for RIP
    - Update each job ticket with position and count
  tools:
    - callas pdfToolbox Imposition
    - Ultimate Impostrip (if licensed)
    - libnest2d/SVGNest (custom)
    - Python/OR‑Tools
    - Barcode generation libs
  outputs:
    - Imposed PDF/signature plan
    - Layout map with job positions
    - JDF/JMF (optional)
  pricingModel:
    - Per imposed job/sheet
    - Monthly subscription for unlimited up to cap
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - RIP compatibility issues
    - Incorrect marks causing downstream errors
    - Late high‑priority job disrupts ganging
  dependencies:
    - Imposition engine license
    - Press constraints/specs
    - Access to job PDFs and due dates
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Rising substrate costs (paper up 15–40% since 2021) make even 1–2% waste
      reductions financially material, yet most imposition/ganging is
      rule-of-thumb or manual.
    - >-
      Prepress bottlenecks: 10–30 minutes of operator time per job for template
      selection, layout, marks, and checks; high variability by operator leads
      to errors and rework.
    - >-
      Existing tools are device- or vendor-specific, limiting cross-press
      optimization (offset + digital) and multi-job ganging across similar specs
      and due dates.
    - >-
      Underutilized sheets and excessive forms/plates from suboptimal ganging
      raise costs (paper, clicks, plates, makeready) and extend turnaround time.
    - >-
      MIS/ERP, Web-to-Print, and DFE/Workflow systems are poorly integrated;
      data often must be rekeyed; ganging decisions ignore live constraints and
      delivery deadlines.
    - >-
      Skill shortages: senior prepress talent is scarce; training new operators
      is slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Inconsistent job tickets, marks, and finishing instructions cause costly
      downstream errors (bindery jams, mismatched cuts, misregistration).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven optimizer that ingests queued jobs from MIS/Web-to-Print/DFEs,
      clusters by stock/format/color/finish/due date, and computes best-fit
      gangs across eligible presses.
    - >-
      Auto-generation of press-ready imposed PDFs with dynamic marks (barcodes,
      cut/fold marks, color bars) and optional JDF/JMF for downstream
      automation.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware engine models sheet sizes, gripper, bleed, gutters,
      duplex, imposition styles (N-up, step-and-repeat,
      sheetwise/work-and-turn), finishing needs, makeready costs, and deadlines.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: feeds back actual makeready, waste, and error data
      to improve future ganging decisions per device and stock.
    - >-
      Operator-in-the-loop UI for quick overrides, preview, what-if scenarios,
      and lock-in rules for customers/SKUs.
    - >-
      Connectors to common MIS/DFE/workflows (EFI, Prinect, Prinergy, Apogee,
      Fiery, Enfocus Switch, callas pdfToolbox) and Web-to-Print (Aleyant,
      OnPrintShop, Shopify).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce substrate waste by 3–10% and prepress touch-time by 50–80% by
    automatically ganging compatible jobs and generating press-ready imposed
    PDFs/JDF—across vendors and presses—within minutes. Achieve measurable ROI
    inside 60 days with real-time, constraint-aware optimization and one-click
    delivery to DFEs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-vendor optimization with a continuously learning model trained on
    anonymized, multi-plant production data, plus a ready-made connectors suite
    (including Enfocus Switch) that deploys in days. ROI-first pilot methodology
    and device-profile library reduce time-to-value and setup complexity
    competitors struggle with.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-size commercial printers (20–200 employees) running sheetfed offset
      and digital presses; product mix: postcards, brochures, flyers, business
      cards, catalogs up to 16-page signatures.
    - >-
      Trade printers and online printers with high order counts and standard
      SKUs requiring aggressive ganging for price competitiveness.
    - >-
      In-plant print operations (universities, healthcare, financial services)
      needing labor/click reduction and SLA adherence.
    - >-
      Multi-site printers seeking centralized ganging across plants with shared
      paper SKUs and similar press formats.
    - >-
      Workflow/MIS vendors seeking embedded optimization as an OEM feature to
      strengthen their stack.
  channels:
    - >-

      focused on 1–3 high-volume SKUs (e.g., business cards, postcards).
    - >-
      Partner/OEM integrations with workflow vendors (Enfocus, callas, EFI,
      Kodak, Agfa, Esko) and listings in their marketplaces/app stores.
    - >-

      Canon) for co-selling and demo-room inclusion; CIP4 participation for
      visibility.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Heads of prepress and production at commercial print shops (NAICS 323111;
    excluding screen and books) who need to push more jobs through with less
    waste and fewer clicks.
  problem: >-
    External: Too many small, variable jobs make manual ganging and imposition
    slow, error-prone, and wasteful. Internal: Teams are tired of firefighting
    and rework. Philosophical: Software should convert specs into optimal,
    press-ready layouts because waste is optional.
  guide: >-
    We speak prepress. Built with input from commercial printers, the service
    honors stock, press, finishing, and due-date constraints; integrates via hot
    folders, MIS, and JDF/JMF; and outputs press-ready imposed PDFs you can
    trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect job sources and constraints (MIS/DFE/hot folders). 2) Set
    objectives (minimize waste and makeready; hit due dates; respect devices).
    3) Review AI-proposed ganging and imposition. 4) Approve or auto-release
    press-ready PDFs/JDF to the queue.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Get an ROI and
    waste benchmark for your current workflow.
  success: >-
    Less substrate waste and makeready, fewer clicks, faster turnarounds, higher
    on-time delivery, healthier margins, and operators focused on exceptions
    instead of manual imposition.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing stock and time waste, missed ship dates, margin erosion, prepress
    burnout, and costly reprints from layout errors.
