leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High ticket volume with inconsistent triage leads to slow
      time-to-resolution (TTR) and overloaded Level 2/Field Service teams.
    - >-
      Unnecessary RMAs/dispatches (no-fault-found) increase cost ($800–$3,500
      per event), cause customer downtime, and erode warranty margins.
    - >-
      Knowledge is fragmented across manuals, SOPs, CRM notes, service reports,
      firmware logs, and training PDFs; agents struggle to find the right fix
      quickly.
    - >-
      Instrument logs and error codes are heterogeneous across product lines
      (HPLC/GC/LC-MS/ICP-MS/FTIR/NMR), requiring domain-specific parsing and
      ontologies.
    - >-
      Lack of evidence-backed RMA decisions and audit trails creates compliance
      and quality risks (ISO 9001/13485-aligned service processes).
    - >-
      Multilingual/global support (Americas, EMEA, APAC) causes quality
      variability and delayed escalations.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into root causes and preventable failure modes reduces
      feedback to engineering for product improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered ticket auto-triage: top-3 issue classification (product,
      subsystem, symptom, cause code, priority) with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Fix recommender: suggests next best actions, KB articles, decision trees,
      and parts checks mapped to BOM/warranty status.
    - >-
      RMA Guardrail engine: risk-scored recommendations to
      repair/recalibrate/dispatch/RMA, with evidence packs and human-in-the-loop
      overrides.
    - >-
      Domain log parsing: parsers for instrument error codes, chromatograms,
      vacuum/temperature/pressure logs; image/OCR of error screens and fronts
      panels.
    - >-
      Evidence pack generator: auto-compiles steps tried, logs, photos, usage
      counters, environment, and warranty—creates an auditable artifact in
      CRM/FSM.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: feedback loops from agent accept/reject, field
      outcomes, and NFF RMAs; model drift monitoring and A/B testing.
    - >-
      Secure deployment: VPC or on-prem, PHI/PII redaction, role-based access,
      SOC 2 roadmap; integrates with Salesforce, ServiceMax, IFS, SAP, Zendesk.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut support TTR by 30–40% and reduce unnecessary RMAs by 15–25% using
    domain-adapted AI that classifies issues, recommends fixes, and enforces
    evidence-backed RMA guardrails integrated with your CRM/FSM—auditable,
    secure, and tuned for analytical instruments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained evidence engine that ties instrument logs,
    warranty/entitlement, and recommended fixes into an auditable RMA
    decision—backed by proprietary parsers and ontologies for analytical
    instruments—yielding measurable savings and compliance readiness that
    generic CRM AI cannot match.
