  problem:
    - >-
      In‑home surveys cost movers 45–90 minutes per lead and require travel;
      20–40% of booked surveys are no‑shows, wasting sales capacity.
    - >-
      Phone checklists and manual video calls miss items; 15–30% of jobs diverge
      from estimate, eroding margin and increasing claims/discounts.
    - >-
      Small and mid‑size movers lack standardized cube sheets and labor/material
      models; quotes are inconsistent across sales reps and offices.
    - >-
      Office moves require asset‑level inventory, building rules (COI, elevator
      time windows), and access constraints; manual capture is error‑prone and
      slow.
    - >-
      Customers want instant quotes and self‑serve options outside business
      hours; slow response drops close rates by 10–25%.
    - >-
      Existing virtual survey tools often require scheduled calls and heavy rep
      involvement; they do not fully automate inventory extraction or pricing.
    - >-
      Regulatory and tariff compliance (e.g., binding/non‑binding estimates,
      valuation, inventory sign‑off) is complex; missteps drive disputes and
      claims.
    - >-
      International and interstate moves need accurate volume/weight; current
      estimates can miss by 10–25%, causing capacity planning issues and reweigh
      disputes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided self‑serve survey: customer receives a link with a step‑by‑step
      video walkthrough and checklist; optional AR overlays to ensure coverage.
    - >-
      AI extracts item inventory from images/video, maps to standard cube
      sheets, estimates cubic feet (CBF) and weight, and detects pack
      requirements and special handling.
    - >-
      Access and complexity capture: prompts for elevator, stairs, long carry,
      parking, COI, building time windows; adds labor and materials accordingly.
    - >-
      Real‑time quote generation using mover’s tariff tables, lane rates, or
      custom price books; supports binding/non‑binding and valuation options.
    - >-
      Sales‑rep console for rapid review, adjustments, upsells (packing,
      crating, storage), and instant e‑signature with deposit collection.
    - >-
      Photo evidence and defect tagging to reduce disputes and claims; shareable
      inventory with customer sign‑off.
    - >-
      APIs and out‑of‑the‑box integrations with leading moving CRMs/dispatch
      systems to eliminate double entry.
    - >-
      Analytics: quote accuracy vs. actuals, rep performance, close rate lift,
      and capacity planning insights.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Close more moves with instant, accurate, and compliant quotes. MoveScope AI
    converts customer photos/video into a verified inventory, cubic
    volume/weight, labor, materials, and a priced estimate—self‑serve or
    guided—integrated into your CRM in minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, and industry‑specific labeled dataset tied to
    post‑move actuals creates a feedback moat; deeply embedded CRM integrations
    and tariff/pricing expertise reduce switching; office‑move features and
    compliance workflows further differentiate while partners distribute at low
    CAC.
