leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      OEM EDI 830/862 volatility and cumulative quantity resets drive constant
      manual firefighting and unstable MPS.
    - >-
      Planners spend 20–40 hours/week per plant reconciling EDI releases with
      ERP demand, inventory, WIP, and firm fences in spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Misalignment between EDI cum logic and ERP consumption leads to over/under
      production, premium freight, and schedule changes.
    - >-
      Lack of early exception detection (e.g., drastic week-over-week 830
      changes, 862 pull-ins) causes late reactions and overtime/lost shifts.
    - >-
      Existing EDI tools translate files but do not propose MPS changes or
      quantify capacity/material impact.
    - >-
      ERP MPS modules are generic; few have automotive-specific fences,
      calendars, packaging multiples, and cume consumption out-of-the-box.
    - >-
      Inaccurate or stale forecasts propagate through MRP causing excess WIP and
      low inventory turns.
    - >-
      No audit trail linking MPS changes to EDI lines, hindering IATF 16949
      compliance and customer scorecards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse and normalize EDI 830/862 (multiple versions), map to
      parts/customers, and apply OEM-specific cumulative logic and calendars.
    - >-
      Fuse EDI demand with on-hand, WIP, in-transit, open orders, firm fences,
      safety stock, packaging multiples, and capacity constraints to recommend
      MPS changes by day/week.
    - >-
      Forecast and smooth demand using schedule-stability-aware models, hedging
      rules, and exception thresholds to reduce nervousness.
    - >-
      Generate an exception workbench that flags pull-ins, push-outs, forecast
      deltas, cume mismatches, and material/capacity shortages with severity
      scoring.
    - >-
      Two-way ERP integration to stage approved MPS changes and create/update
      planned orders; full audit trail linking each MPS change to EDI lines and
      assumptions.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: simulate shifts, overtime, supplier lead-time changes,
      or packaging lot sizes; output KPIs and risk indicators.
    - >-
      Governance: approval workflows, role-based access, IATF-friendly audit
      logs and data retention policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automotive-native AI that turns 830/862 releases into stable, auditable MPS
    proposals within hours—not days—cutting premium freight and planner workload

  character: >-
    A plant scheduler/operations planner at a Tier-1/Tier-2 steering &
    suspension components manufacturer who must hit OEM releases without burning
    cash on expedites and overtime.
  problem: >-
    EDI 830/862 volatility and last-minute changes make spreadsheets and MRP
    misleading—planners can’t see true demand vs. on-hand/WIP/capacity, leading
    to stockouts or overbuild, premium freight, chargebacks, and missed
    scorecards.
  guide: >-
    We’re an automotive-EDI–savvy AI planning partner. We parse 830/862 in real
    time, reconcile with inventory/WIP and constraints, and propose clear MPS
    updates—secure, auditable, and built for IATF/ISO environments.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect EDI/ERP/MES (API/SFTP). 2) AI forecasts, reconciles, and
    simulates constraints to propose MPS. 3) Planner reviews/approves; updates
    flow back to ERP with daily alerts.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot using your 830/862 files.
  success: >-
    Stable, reliable MPS; 98%+ schedule adherence; fewer expedites and
    chargebacks; lower WIP/FG; improved OEM scorecards; freed planner time and
    predictable shifts.
  failure: >-
    Continue firefighting: line-down risk, premium freight, chargebacks, bloated
    inventory, overtime, and uncertain delivery performance.
