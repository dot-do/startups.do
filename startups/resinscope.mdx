leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High resin price volatility (ABS, ASA, PMMA, PP, PS, UPR) drives 10–30%
      swings year over year; purchases are often mistimed due to limited market
      visibility.
    - >-
      Supplier quotes vary by grade, freight, terms, and MOQs, making
      apples-to-apples comparison slow and error-prone; most teams rely on
      spreadsheets and manual email parsing.
    - >-
      Inventory/cash tradeoffs are opaque; buyers either overbuy (higher
      carrying cost and obsolescence) or underbuy (expediting and stockouts)
      because they lack forward price signals tied to demand and capacity.
    - >-
      Price increase letters and force majeure events (e.g., Gulf Coast
      disruptions) arrive with little warning; procurement lacks quantifiable
      playbooks for when to pull forward buys or sit out increases.
    - >-
      No integrated system links index data, supplier quotes, and plant ERP
      demand to produce actionable “buy windows” and optimal volumes per
      grade/location.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous ingestion of resin indices (ABS/ASA/PMMA/PP/PS/UPR) and
      feedstocks (styrene, benzene, ethylene, propylene, MMA, crude) to produce
      a forward view by grade and region.
    - >-
      Quote capture and normalization (email/EDI/OCR) to convert supplier quotes
      into comparable delivered prices by grade/spec, terms, freight, and MOQs.
    - >-
      Buy-window optimizer: recommends purchase timing and volumes over a 1–6
      month horizon using demand forecasts, storage capacity, safety stock, lead
      times, WACC, and carrying costs.
    - >-
      Scenario engine: simulate outcomes (e.g., hurricane shock, force majeure,
      feedstock spike) and “buy now vs. wait” ROI with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Automated alerts and workflows: price inflection alerts, expiring quotes,
      pull-forward triggers; create purchase requisitions in ERP once approved.
    - >-
      Supplier scorecards and negotiation support: benchmark quotes vs. market,
      term tradeoffs, and performance KPIs (OTIF, lead-times, variance to
      index).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn volatile resin markets into scheduled savings for plastics plumbing
    fixture makers: normalized delivered-cost visibility, 1–6 month price
    forecasts, and precise buy-window and volume recommendations integrated to
    your ERP—delivering 2–6% resin savings, 5–10 days DIO reduction, and payback
    in under 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific delivered-cost normalization and buy-window optimization
    tuned to plumbing fixtures, powered by a growing, anonymized network of real
    supplier quotes—producing benchmarks competitors can’t easily replicate.
    Early partnerships with distributors and ERP vendors create distribution and
    data advantages; finance-grade savings verification builds trust and
    stickiness.
