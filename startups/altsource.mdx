  problem:
    - >-
      Single-source and EOL components create unplanned line stops and long
      redesign cycles; many BOMs still have >30% single-source coverage in this
      category.
    - >-
      Manual alternate search across distributors, datasheets, and forums takes
      2–4 hours per part and is error-prone, especially for precision analog,
      optics, and motion components.
    - >-
      ECOs and RFQs are slow and inconsistent; cross-functional handoffs
      (ENG-SCM-QA-RA) lengthen cycle time by 2–6 weeks.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into lifecycle risk (PDNs/PCNs), regional
      concentration, counterfeit risk, and compliance (RoHS/REACH/UL/IEC 61010)
      for alternates.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (PLM, ERP, EDA/CAD, CM portals) cause duplicate data
      entry, stale AVLs, and poor traceability of sourcing decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest BOMs, schematics, and datasheets; map MPNs to a compatibility graph
      across electronics, optics, pneumatics, and motion.
    - >-
      Generate ranked FFF alternates with parameter deltas, suggested
      circuit/layout notes, and validation plans.
    - >-
      Risk scoring per part and at BOM-level: lead-time, lifecycle/EOL,
      regional/geopolitical exposure, multi-sourcing coverage, counterfeit risk,
      compliance flags.
    - >-
      Auto-draft ECO packets (diffs, AVL updates, test protocols, regulatory
      notes) and RFQs (specs, volumes, alternates, delivery windows).
    - >-
      One-click push/pull to PLM (Arena, Agile, Windchill, Propel), ERP (SAP,
      Oracle, NetSuite), and EDA (Altium, OrCAD) with audit trails.
    - >-
      Watchlists and alerts for PDNs/PCNs, lead-time spikes, and price
      volatility; scenario analysis for dual-sourcing and cost/risk tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review with explainability (datasheet citations, param
      comparisons) and role-based approvals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI copilot that finds vetted form-fit-function alternates, quantifies
    supply/compliance risk, and drafts ready-to-release ECOs and RFQs integrated
    with your PLM/ERP—cut shortage firefighting by 30–50% and ECO cycle time by
    30–40% within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Instrumentation-specific compatibility models and validation templates
    (electronics, optics, pneumatics, thermal) combined with a proprietary
    feedback loop from OEM and EMS validation outcomes; deep PLM/ECO integration
    that auto-generates compliant documentation and audit trails—reducing human
    effort while maintaining traceability required in regulated lab
    environments.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops, sourcing, and NPI engineers at analytical lab instrument OEMs (NAICS
    334516) who need to keep production on schedule and compliant. They want
    proven, drop-in alternates fast—with documentation ready for review.
  problem: >-
    - External: Unplanned shortages, allocations, and EOLs on semis, sensors,
    optics, and connectors stall builds.

    - Internal: Teams burn weeks in spreadsheets and PDFs, anxious about picking
    a bad substitute.

    - Philosophical: Critical science shouldn’t stop because a $2 component
    isn’t available.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the scramble to protect builds, quality, and audit
    trails under tight launch dates.

    - Authority: Built by ex-instrument OEM engineers and supply-chain pros;
    maps FFF equivalence, compliance (RoHS/REACH), lifecycle, and counterfeit
    risk; integrates with your PLM/ERP to produce clean ECO/RFQ drafts.
  plan: >-
    3-step plan:

    1) Connect: Sync BOM/AVL, constraints (electrical/FFF), approved suppliers,
    and certifications.

    2) Propose: AI finds cross-compatible parts, scores
    supply/obsolescence/compliance risk, and drafts ECOs/RFQs.

    3) Approve & execute: Route ECO for sign-off, send RFQs, track responses;
    system learns from decisions.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Start a pilot with one critical BOM this week.
    - Transitional: Get a free shortage and risk scan on 50 parts.
  success: >-
    Ship on time, avoid line-down events, and protect margins. Cut research time
    from days to minutes, diversify the AVL, reduce expedite spend, and keep
    clean, audit-ready ECO/RFQ documentation—without compromising performance or
    compliance.
  failure: >-
    Missed ship dates, idle lines, costly redesigns, audit issues from poor
    documentation, quality escapes from risky alternates, and lost customer
    trust and revenue.
