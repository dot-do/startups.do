  problem:
    - >-
      Field engineers spend 15–30 minutes per ticket writing notes and
      summarizing multi-source logs, leading to ~2–3 hours/day of administrative
      load per engineer.
    - >-
      Critical tool-down events suffer from long mean time to resolution (MTTR)
      due to scattered knowledge across wikis, PDFs, email threads, and legacy
      CMMS/EAM records.
    - >-
      First-time fix rate (FTFR) is constrained by inconsistent symptom
      classification and limited visibility into similar past fixes and correct
      parts combinations.
    - >-
      Onboarding new engineers takes 6–12 months to reach proficiency due to
      complex equipment and tribal knowledge trapped in text notes and senior
      experts’ heads.
    - >-
      Mis-ordered or incomplete parts lists cause re-visits and extended
      downtime; parts recommendation logic is rarely encoded or tested.
    - >-
      Global operations face documentation inconsistency and language barriers
      across US, EU, JP, KR, TW, and CN sites, slowing collaboration and
      increasing error rates.
    - >-
      Semiconductor OEMs and fabs require strict data privacy, security, and
      auditability (air-gapped or VPC, full traceability), which generic SaaS
      tools don’t support well.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted ticket summarization that ingests multi-modal inputs
      (technician notes, tool logs, alarms, photos) and produces concise,
      standardized summaries.
    - >-
      Symptom classification using a semiconductor-specific taxonomy mapped to
      tool families and SEMI E10/E116 equipment states; confidence scores with
      explainability.
    - >-
      RAG-driven retrieval of similar past incidents and validated fixes from
      CMMS/EAM, PLM service bulletins, and knowledge bases.
    - >-
      Drafted resolution steps and checklists aligned to SOPs, including
      required parts and quantities; highlights hazardous steps and
      lockout/tagout requirements.
    - >-
      Parts list recommender using co-occurrence graphs and BOM/PLM data to
      reduce mis-picks; flags obsolete or superseded part numbers.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: engineers accept/edit summaries and
      recommendations; feedback is captured to continuously improve models.
    - >-
      Seamless integrations with ServiceNow FSM, Salesforce Field Service, IBM
      Maximo, SAP PM, IFS, and Oracle EAM; connectors to PLM (Siemens
      Teamcenter, PTC Windchill) and document repositories.
    - >-
      Deployment options: VPC single-tenant or on-prem/air‑gapped with hardware
      acceleration; SSO, SCIM, RBAC, and audit trails.
    - >-
      Multilingual support for EN/JP/KR/ZH with consistent taxonomy;
      auto-translation preserving technical terms via custom glossary.
    - >-
      Model governance and evaluation harness: offline/online A/B tests,
      acceptance rates, safety filters, and data governance dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce MTTR by 15–30% and increase FTFR by 5–12 points by turning every
    service ticket into structured, searchable knowledge and recommending proven
    fixes and parts—securely deployed in fab/OEM environments with
    human-in-the-loop control and full auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Semiconductor-specific symptom/failure-mode ontology and parts co-occurrence
    graph built from curated, labeled historical tickets; hardened on-prem/VPC
    deployment patterns for air-gapped fabs; and continuous learning loops tied
    to CMMS/EAM outcomes (closed-loop ground truth) that generalist service AI
    vendors lack.

    Service managers and field service engineers at semiconductor equipment OEMs
    and service partners (NAICS 333242) who must restore high-value tools to
    uptime fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: Fragmented, verbose tickets; inconsistent symptom labels; prior
    fixes buried in silos; slow parts identification.

    - Internal: Frustration from context switching and repeat truck rolls;
    pressure to hit MTTR and first-time-fix targets.

    - Philosophical: Million-dollar tools shouldn’t depend on tribal knowledge
    to get back online.
