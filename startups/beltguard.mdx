  problem:
    - >-
      Underground coal mines experience unplanned conveyor downtime from
      misalignment, seized/failed rollers, and splice degradation, costing
      $5,000–$25,000 per hour in lost production and maintenance labor.
    - >-
      Belt fires from overheated idlers and friction account for a small but
      catastrophic share of incidents; a single belt fire can exceed $1–$10M in
      losses and weeks of disruption.
    - >-
      Manual belt-walking inspections are high-risk, labor-intensive, and
      intermittent (typically once per shift), missing early-stage failures that
      evolve within hours.
    - >-
      Existing point sensors and SCADA alarms (temperature, speed, pullcords)
      provide limited coverage and high false alarms; current solutions rarely
      fuse acoustic, thermal, and visual cues in real time.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (MSHA, ATEX/IECEx) and insurer-driven risk mitigation
      require auditable, proactive monitoring without adding operational burden
      or non-compliant electronics underground.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy intrinsically safe (MSHA/ATEX/IECEx-compliant) acoustic arrays
      every 75–100 m to localize abnormal idler noise signatures (bearing
      rumble, flat-spot, seizure progression).
    - >-
      Install Ex-rated thermal cameras at drive heads, tail sections, and
      transfer points to catch hotspots, friction heating, and material
      build-up; optional line-scanner or wide-FOV thermal for return-side belt
      and idler banks.
    - >-
      Edge vision modules at critical points (head/tail/transfer) to detect belt
      drift >20 mm, splice damage, belt tears, material spillage, and blocked
      chutework, with dust-robust models and IR-assisted illumination.
    - >-
      Edge computing nodes aggregate sensor streams; on-device models execute
      real-time inference with sub-1s latency and send prioritized events to
      SCADA (Modbus/TCP, OPC UA), historian, and BeltGuard cloud.
    - >-
      Cloud analytics fuse event history with operating context (load, speed,
      ambient) for root-cause insights, failure progression scoring, and
      predictive maintenance schedules.
    - >-
      Operator tools: 24/7 monitoring dashboard, triage workflows, mobile
      alerts, work order auto-generation via CMMS integration (SAP, Ellipse, IBM
      Maximo).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, intrinsically safe, multi-sensor AI that detects misalignment,
    seized rollers, splice issues, and incipient fires minutes to hours earlier
    than manual inspection—reducing belt-related downtime by 30–50% and
    materially lowering fire risk with auditable, regulator-ready reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary multi-modal dataset and models specifically trained in
    underground coal conditions (dust, humidity, echoes, low light), combined

    teams who need safer, continuous conveyor performance with fewer stoppages.
  problem: >-
    Conveyor issues often go unseen underground—misalignment, seized rollers,
    splice degradation, and heat build-up—leading to fires, evacuations,
    compliance exposure, and costly downtime; manual inspections are periodic
    and miss early warnings.

    analytics; proven underground deployments; integrates with existing cameras,
    mics, sensors, and SCADA; provides explainable alerts, audit trails, and
    practical playbooks for crews.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: site survey, data readiness, KPI targets 2) Deploy: connect
    thermal/vision, acoustic, and vibration feeds; tune models to your belts 3)
    Action: real-time alerts to control room and CMMS, monthly performance
    reviews and model updates.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-day underground pilot and live demo; request an ROI and
    risk-reduction report.
  success: >-
    Early detection of misalignment, seized rollers, splice issues, and abnormal
    heat signatures; helps prevent fires, reduces unplanned downtime and patrol
    burden, extends belt life, supports compliance, and lifts OEE and production
    predictability.
  failure: >-
    Without proactive detection, small anomalies escalate into fires,
    evacuations, injuries, regulator findings, prolonged shutdowns, asset
    damage, and lost production.

  problem:
    - >-
      Friction from misalignment and seized rollers creates dangerous heat and
      fire risk.
    - 'Manual belt walks are costly, inconsistent, and expose crews to hazards.'

    - >-
      Harsh conditions (dark, dust, noise) defeat traditional sensors and
      cameras.
    - Alarm floods from simple thresholds cause fatigue and missed events.
    - Compliance and incident reporting consume valuable production time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fused thermal, acoustic, and vibration analytics detect misalignment,
      seized rollers, splice defects, and hot spots early.
