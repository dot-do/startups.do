  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned seamer downtime halts entire canning lines; typical lost
      production costs $5,000–$25,000 per hour for high-speed beverage/food
      operations.
    - >-
      Wear on bearings, rolls, and chucks degrades double-seam integrity
      (leakers, wrinkles, false seams). Detection is often reactive, relying on
      periodic teardowns (e.g., every 1–2 hours) and operator intuition.
    - >-
      Linking quality trends (seam thickness, countersink, overlap, body/cover
      hook, tightness, wrinkle rating) to exact setting changes (roll
      position/pressure, chuck/lifter adjustments) is tribal knowledge;
      changeovers can take 30–90 minutes to dial in.
    - >-
      Calendar-based preventive maintenance either replaces parts early (wasting
      $10k–$50k/year/line in parts/labor) or late (causing failures and scrap).
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLC/SCADA, SPC/quality systems, and CMMS; there’s no
      seamer-specific AI to correlate process signals with QC outcomes and
      maintenance actions.
    - >-
      New SKUs and material variability (ends, bodies, coatings) increase seam
      variability, overwhelming standard SOPs and checklists.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-enabled data acquisition kit attaches to seamer: vibration, acoustic,
      and temperature on bearings/gearboxes; torque/current from drives; line
      speed; plus digital ingestion of SPC/seam teardown data (countersink,
      thickness, body/cover hook, overlap, tightness).
    - >-
      Seamer-specific ML models estimate remaining useful life (RUL) for
      bearings/rolls/chucks and detect early-stage anomalies with 2–6 weeks lead
      time; confidence intervals and false-alarm controls included.
    - >-
      Setup Advisor maps quality trends to recommended setting changes (e.g.,
      1st/2nd roll radial/axial position adjustments in thousandths of an inch,
      chuck/lifter pressure tweaks) with predicted impact on seam metrics.
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflow: create CMMS work orders automatically (SAP PM,
      Maximo, Fiix), push SOPs to operators, and verify results via
      post-adjustment SPC.
    - >-
      Multi-line benchmarking, changeover playbooks by SKU/format, and “what-if”
      simulation to minimize scrap during ramp-up.
    - >-
      Security-first architecture: on-prem edge with OPC UA/MQTT; cloud or
      private data center analytics; ISO 27001-aligned controls; offline
      tolerance and safe fallback.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut seam-related unplanned downtime by up to 30%, reduce defects/leakers by
    up to 50%, and dial in optimal seamer settings in minutes—not hours—using
    seamer-specific AI that predicts component wear and prescribes exact,
    auditable interventions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A seamer-specific AI stack combining a validated geometry-based setup
    advisor with component-level RUL models trained on multi-OEM data, plus OEM
    and QC-vendor integrations that close the loop from prediction to verified
    intervention—difficult for generic PdM or SPC vendors to replicate.

  character: >-
    Ops leaders in metal can manufacturing (NAICS 332431)—seamer supervisors,
    maintenance leads, and quality managers—responsible for uptime and seam
    integrity.
  problem: >-
    Bearing, roll, and chuck wear is invisible until defects and downtime hit;
    settings drift across shifts; quality trends aren’t tied back to the seamer;
    teams rely on tribal knowledge.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to ship perfect cans at speed. Our Seamer
    Predictive Maintenance and Setup Advisor blends seamer expertise with AI to
    detect wear early, link quality trends to machine settings, and provide
    clear next steps.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest sensor, PLC, and quality data (vibration, current,
    temperature, torque, teardown, SPC). 2) Calibrate: baseline each seamer;
    learn wear patterns and setting–quality relationships. 3) Act: prioritized
    maintenance, setup recommendations, parts and scheduling guidance, with
    closed-loop verification.
  callToAction: Start a 60-day pilot on one line—book a 30-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Predictable uptime, fewer seam defects, lower scrap, faster changeovers,
    consistent settings by SKU, audit-ready traceability, captured best
    practices, and confident teams.
  failure: >-
    Remain reactive—unplanned stops, leakers, scrap and rework, missed
    shipments, audit risk, and loss of know-how.
