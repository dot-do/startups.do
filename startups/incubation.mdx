leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Hatchability and chick quality vary 1–4 percentage points batch-to-batch
      due to breeder age, egg storage time, shell quality, and ambient
      conditions; static setpoints don’t adapt in time.
    - >-
      Operators manage heterogeneous equipment (e.g., Petersime, Jamesway Chick
      Master, Pas Reform) with differing interfaces and ‘recipes’; tribal
      knowledge is not consistently applied across shifts/sites.
    - >-
      Small setpoint errors (0.1–0.3°C, 2–5% RH, CO₂/ventilation timing)
      compound over stages, causing late/early hatches, culls, and 7-day
      mortality increases.
    - >-
      Limited real-time guidance: OEM systems log and alarm but rarely translate
      data into machine-specific, stage-aware instructions with accountability
      and audit trails.
    - >-
      Inconsistent SOP adherence and documentation impede root-cause analysis
      and regulatory/customer audits.
    - >-
      Energy and water costs are rising; inefficient profiles add 5–15% energy
      per 1,000 chicks set.
    - >-
      Data from PLCs, climate systems, and QC (candling, breakout, chick weight)
      are siloed, preventing predictive insights and closed-loop improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to incubator/hatcher PLCs (Siemens/Allen-Bradley), climate/HVAC
      (e.g., Munters), and QC data to build a live, stage-aware model of each
      batch.
    - >-
      AI agent recommends setpoint adjustments (temp, RH, CO₂, ventilation,
      turning) tailored to cabinet model, breeder age, egg storage time, and
      ambient conditions; includes confidence and expected impact.
    - >-
      Generate machine-specific, step-by-step instructions and schedules (e.g.,
      “Jamesway J180, Batch 24: at 18:00 reduce SP to 37.4°C; open damper +8%;
      RH target 52% for 4h”) for supervisor approval on desktop/mobile.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator to A/B test profiles on selected cabinets; predicts
      hatch window, late/early trend, chick yield, and energy deltas before
      implementation.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection and risk scoring (e.g., CO₂ overshoot risk, hot-spot
      probability) with prioritized watchlist per batch/site.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis and post-hatch review linking outcomes to setpoint
      history, environmental data, and SOP deviations; auto-generate corrective
      actions.
    - >-
      Digital SOPs library mapped to OEM models; automated documentation,
      e-signature, and audit-ready reports (HACCP/ISO).
    - >-
      Edge agent option for low-latency recommendations, with cloud sync for
      analytics; offline buffering and safe-mode reversion.
    - >-
      Benchmarking dashboards across sites (hatchability, chick quality score,
      culls, energy/1,000 chicks) with cohorting by breeder flock and egg age.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A vendor-neutral AI copilot that transforms multi-source hatch data into
    machine-specific, step-by-step setpoint tweaks by stage and
    condition—raising hatchability by 0.5–1.5 percentage points, improving chick
    quality, and cutting energy 5–12%—with human-in-the-loop approval, full
    audit trails, and ROI in under 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-OEM instruction translator plus a growing, proprietary dataset
    linking stage-aware setpoint micro-adjustments to outcomes across breeds,
    breeder ages, and ambient conditions—validated through controlled A/B trials
    and embedded in audit-grade workflows. Early OEM/integrator partnerships and
    university-backed studies create defensible switching costs and credibility.

  character: >-
    Hatchery managers and incubation techs at poultry hatcheries (NAICS 112340)
    who must hit hatch rate, chick quality, and cost targets across mixed fleets
    of setters and hatchers.
  problem: >-
    External: Egg quality, flock age, and environment shift ideal setpoints
    daily. Internal: Tribal knowledge and time pressure make consistent tweaks
    hard. Philosophical: Decisions should be data-driven, not guesswork. Stakes:
    Each mis-set wastes chicks, energy, and trust.
  guide: >-
    Incubation Setpoint Advisor is a vendor-agnostic AI copilot trained on
    hatchery science and your machine data. Built with poultry physiologists and
    validated in pilots, it explains why, shows confidence, and never changes
    settings without your approval.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest machine logs, sensors, and flock data; map to each model
    (Jamesway, Petersime, ChickMaster, etc.). 2) Advise:
    stage-and-condition-specific setpoint tweaks with clear rationales and risk
    flags. 3) Approve & Apply: operator reviews and executes machine-specific,
    step-by-step instructions; all changes logged. 4) Learn: monitor outcomes,
    refine rules, and auto-generate shift reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-day pilot on two machines. Secondary: Request sample SOPs
    and a customized ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Consistent hatch improvements (+0.5–2.0 points), stronger chick quality and
    uniformity, fewer late deads/culls, lower energy and rework, faster
    training, clean audits, and confident, calm shifts.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: inconsistent hatches, preventable chick losses, wasted
    energy and overtime, audit findings, and dependence on a single expert.

  problem:
    - >-
      Static recipes ignore egg age, storage time, flock differences, and
      ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent adjustments across shifts lead to uneven hatch and chick
      quality.
    - Tuning requires deep menu navigation; errors are costly and hard to trace.
    - Machine drift and sensor variance go unnoticed until results drop.
    - >-
      Data lives in silos; managers lack a clear audit trail of who changed what
      and why.
    - New techs need months to learn machine workflows and safe limits.
  solution:
    - >-
      Adaptive recommendations by stage (pre-heat, setter, transfer, hatcher)
      for temperature, humidity, ventilation/CO2, turning, and fan settings.
    - >-
      Converts advice into precise, model-specific, button-by-button
      instructions for each setter/hatcher brand.
    - >-

      adjust in real time.
    - >-
      Target weight-loss curves and what-if simulations before you approve
      changes.
    - 'Auto-compensation for altitude, ambient temperature, and load size.'
    - 'Role-based approvals, e-signatures, and audit-grade time-stamped logs.'
    - >-
      Guardrails with min/max limits, interlocks, and rapid rollback to
