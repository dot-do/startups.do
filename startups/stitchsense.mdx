leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic stockouts on fast-moving colorways and notions during seasonal
      peaks (e.g., Q4 holidays, back-to-school), causing lost sales and class
      cancellations.
    - >-
      Overstock on slow movers and discontinued prints tying up working capital;
      dead stock clearance erodes margins.
    - >-
      Manual reordering via spreadsheets or POS exports is time-consuming and
      error-prone; staff guess at safety stock and reorder points.
    - >-
      Vendor constraints (bolt/piece increments, MOQs, color assortments) and
      6–12 week lead times make optimal ordering hard.
    - >-
      Intermittent, long-tail demand patterns for SKUs (threads, trims, rare
      colors) make generic forecasting inaccurate.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true demand drivers (classes, kits/BOMs, promos,
      new product launches) and their impact on SKU-level demand.
    - >-
      Lack of EDI capabilities; sending vendor-ready POs (850/CSV/email)
      requires manual formatting and back-and-forth.
    - >-
      No unified, measurable planning process; owners can’t track forecast
      accuracy, turns, or GMROI improvements over time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect POS/ecommerce to ingest sales, on-hand, on-order, returns,
      promotions, and class calendars.
    - >-
      Forecast SKU/location demand using models tuned for intermittent retail
      demand (Croston variants, hierarchical Bayesian, gradient boosting), with
      seasonality and event uplifts.
    - >-
      Calculate safety stock and reorder points by vendor/lead time and target
      service level (e.g., 95%).
    - >-
      Auto-generate vendor-ready POs (EDI 850 via SPS/TrueCommerce, CSV
      templates, or formatted email) honoring bolt/pack increments, MOQs, color
      assortments, and budget caps.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate promotions, class schedules, and vendor
      lead-time changes; show impacts on stockouts, cash, and turns.
    - >-
      New SKU cold-start using attribute similarity (collection, fiber, color
      family, brand) and parent-child relationships (colorways/widths).
    - >-
      Open-to-buy integration and weekly buy recommendations aligned to budget
      and GMROI targets.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: monitor forecast error (MAPE/WAPE), bias, and adjust
      models automatically by segment.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts and dead stock with an AI that forecasts SKU-level demand
    for sewing and piece-goods retailers and auto-generates vendor-ready
    purchase orders that respect bolt sizes, MOQs, lead times, and
    seasonality—delivering 90-day payback through higher turns and lower working
    capital.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized forecasting plus a living vendor-rules library (bolts, packs,
    assortments) and class/kit-aware demand modeling, powered by anonymized,
    cross-retailer benchmarks—delivering out-of-the-box accuracy and
    vendor-ready POs that generic tools can’t match.
