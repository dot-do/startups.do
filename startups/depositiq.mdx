  problem:
    - >-
      Low product-per-household (PPH) among depositors (often 1.3–1.8) limits
      lifetime value; executive targets are 2.3–2.8+.
    - >-
      Mass campaigns convert poorly (typical 0.1–0.5%); institutions need
      measurable uplift without increasing contact fatigue or opt-outs.
    - >-
      AI use is constrained by compliance (Reg B, UDAAP, FCRA, GLBA/Reg P,
      TCPA/CAN-SPAM) and model risk requirements (SR 11-7/OCC 2011-12).
    - >-
      Customer data is siloed across core, online/mobile banking, card
      processor, and call center; lack of identity resolution and real-time
      decisioning delays offers.
    - >-
      Attribution is unreliable; many banks lack randomized control testing
      (RCT) to prove incremental profit and guide spend allocation.
    - >-
      Implementations with large suites are costly and slow (6–12 months), out
      of reach for mid-market banks and credit unions with lean IT teams.
    - >-
      Branch and contact-center teams lack guided “next conversation” prompts,
      leading to inconsistent cross-sell in human channels.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: secure ingestion from core (DDA/SAV/CD), card, digital
      banking, ACH, and CRM; deterministic/probabilistic identity resolution
      with consent/opt-out governance.
    - >-
      Uplift-first modeling: product propensities, eligibility, risk and offer
      response uplift (CATE) per product (credit card, HELOC, personal/auto
      loans, mortgage/HE, CDs, overdraft protection, bill pay, debit
      activation).
    - >-
      Policy-aware decisioning: rules + ML with contact caps, offer eligibility,
      recency/frequency, fairness constraints, and channel arbitration (best
      channel now).
    - >-
      Real-time and batch execution: APIs for mobile/online, ATM, call center
      and teller prompts; batch for email, push, and direct mail; webhooks for
      journey tools.
    - >-
      Experimentation-by-design: persistent control groups, multivariate tests,
      and incrementality dashboards to compare treatments vs. controls at
      product and segment levels.
    - >-
      Compliance and explainability: sensitive attribute handling, feature
      governance, adverse action workflows when required, audit trails, model
      cards, and challenger models.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors: Fiserv/FIS/Jack Henry, Q2/Alkami,
      Salesforce/Adobe/Braze, Genesys/Five9; optional prescreen integrations
      with bureaus for firm offers of credit.
    - >-
      Secure cloud deployment: SOC 2 Type II, SSO/SAML, network isolation;
      options for VPC or on-prem connectors for sensitive data.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Regulator-ready AI that turns deposit relationships into multi-product
    households. Predict, decide, and deliver the next best compliant offer
    across all channels in milliseconds—and prove incremental profit with
    built-in experimentation. Expect 20–60% lift in product adoption, +0.2–0.5
    PPH in 12 months, and 3–7x ROI within two quarters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compliance-by-design next-best-action tailored for depository institutions:
    uplift-first models, banking-specific connectors, and regulator-ready
    documentation out of the box. Faster time-to-value for mid-market (live in
    <60 days), full-channel coverage including branch/call center, and built-in
    RCT to prove incremental profit—capabilities big suites deliver only with
    long, costly programs.

  keyMetrics:
    - >-
      Incremental conversion uplift (primary): uplift = conversion_treatment −
      conversion_control; target +50% to +200% relative lift depending on
      product.
    - >-
      Incremental profit per 1,000 offers (IPK): IPK = (conversions_incremental
      × first-year net profit per product) − (offer_costs + platform_costs).
      Example: credit card: 0.6% incremental × $150 = $900 − $200 = $700 per
      1,000 offers.
    - >-
      PPH improvement: +0.1 within 6 months and +0.2–0.5 within 12 months in
      target segments.
    - >-
      Contact efficiency: offers per sale and cost per incremental sale; target
      150–400 offers/sale for credit cards, 1,000–3,000 for HELOC/Mortgage
      depending on eligibility and rates.
    - >-
      Time-to-value: days to first live campaign (<60 days) and to verified
      uplift via RCT (<120 days).
    - >-
      Channel performance: real-time API p95 latency <250 ms; decision
      throughput; channel coverage (% of active users seeing NBA in digital
      channels).
    - >-
      Model quality: AUC >0.70 for propensities, ECE/calibration error <5%,
      weekly drift score, refresh cadence ≤90 days.
    - >-
      Fairness/compliance: demographic parity or equal opportunity ratio ≥0.8
      across monitored segments; opt-out rate <1% per month; complaint rate <5
      per 100k offers; 100% decisions auditable.
    - >-
      Revenue impact: incremental annualized net income from cross-sell; target
      0.05–0.20% of assets in incremental consumer banking net income for mature
      programs.
    - >-
      Adoption: % of frontline using guidance >70%, % of marketing journeys with

    Growth, marketing, and product leaders at banks, credit unions, and savings
    institutions who need to deepen relationships and grow share‑of‑wallet
    without spamming customers or risking compliance.
  problem: >-
    External: Generic, batch campaigns underperform; data is siloed; timing is
    off; channels are disjointed; compliance is strict. Internal: Pressure to
    hit growth targets on tight budgets with audit scrutiny. Philosophical:
    Depositors deserve timely, relevant, and fair offers that respect their
    privacy and preferences.

    We understand regulated growth is hard—margins are thin and scrutiny is
    high. Our team blends bank, credit union, and fintech experience; our
    platform is secure and explainable, with model governance, audit trails, and
    fairness checks proven in production with depository institutions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & govern: Securely unify core, CRM, and digital banking data;
    capture consent and eligibility. 2) Predict & prioritize: AI propensities
    plus business rules to choose the compliant next‑best‑action for each
    depositor. 3) Orchestrate & optimize: Deliver personalized offers across
    digital, branch, and contact center; measure, learn, and improve. Agreement:
    clear KPIs, privacy‑first DPA/SLA, no black box.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 60‑day pilot. Transitional: Request
    a free opportunity map and compliance brief.
  success: >-
    Higher products‑per‑household and conversion, lower acquisition cost,
    consistent cross‑channel experiences, increased deposit stickiness and
    balances, faster growth with audit‑ready documentation and confident teams.
  failure: >-
    Continued spray‑and‑pray outreach, low conversion, rising attrition, lost
    wallet share to challengers, wasted marketing spend, and greater compliance
    exposure.
