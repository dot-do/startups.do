  problem:
    - >-
      Low product-per-household (PPH) among depositors (often 1.3–1.8) limits
      lifetime value; executive targets are 2.3–2.8+.
    - >-
      Mass campaigns convert poorly (typical 0.1–0.5%); institutions need
      measurable uplift without increasing contact fatigue or opt-outs.
    - >-
      AI use is constrained by compliance (Reg B, UDAAP, FCRA, GLBA/Reg P,
      TCPA/CAN-SPAM) and model risk requirements (SR 11-7/OCC 2011-12).
    - >-
      Customer data is siloed across core, online/mobile banking, card
      processor, and call center; lack of identity resolution and real-time
      decisioning delays offers.
    - >-
      Attribution is unreliable; many banks lack randomized control testing
      (RCT) to prove incremental profit and guide spend allocation.
    - >-
      Implementations with large suites are costly and slow (6–12 months), out
      of reach for mid-market banks and credit unions with lean IT teams.
    - >-
      Branch and contact-center teams lack guided “next conversation” prompts,
      leading to inconsistent cross-sell in human channels.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: secure ingestion from core (DDA/SAV/CD), card, digital
      banking, ACH, and CRM; deterministic/probabilistic identity resolution
      with consent/opt-out governance.
    - >-
      Uplift-first modeling: product propensities, eligibility, risk and offer
      response uplift (CATE) per product (credit card, HELOC, personal/auto
      loans, mortgage/HE, CDs, overdraft protection, bill pay, debit
      activation).
    - >-
      Policy-aware decisioning: rules + ML with contact caps, offer eligibility,
      recency/frequency, fairness constraints, and channel arbitration (best
      channel now).
    - >-
      Real-time and batch execution: APIs for mobile/online, ATM, call center
      and teller prompts; batch for email, push, and direct mail; webhooks for
      journey tools.
    - >-
      Experimentation-by-design: persistent control groups, multivariate tests,
      and incrementality dashboards to compare treatments vs. controls at
      product and segment levels.
    - >-
      Compliance and explainability: sensitive attribute handling, feature
      governance, adverse action workflows when required, audit trails, model
      cards, and challenger models.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors: Fiserv/FIS/Jack Henry, Q2/Alkami,
      Salesforce/Adobe/Braze, Genesys/Five9; optional prescreen integrations
      with bureaus for firm offers of credit.
    - >-
      Secure cloud deployment: SOC 2 Type II, SSO/SAML, network isolation;
      options for VPC or on-prem connectors for sensitive data.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Regulator-ready AI that turns deposit relationships into multi-product
    households. Predict, decide, and deliver the next best compliant offer
    across all channels in milliseconds—and prove incremental profit with
    built-in experimentation. Expect 20–60% lift in product adoption, +0.2–0.5
    PPH in 12 months, and 3–7x ROI within two quarters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compliance-by-design next-best-action tailored for depository institutions:
    uplift-first models, banking-specific connectors, and regulator-ready
    documentation out of the box. Faster time-to-value for mid-market (live in
    <60 days), full-channel coverage including branch/call center, and built-in
    RCT to prove incremental profit—capabilities big suites deliver only with
    long, costly programs.
  customerSegments:

      connectors and environments.
    - >-
      Managed services (campaign ops, modeling, compliance reporting): $10k–$40k
      per quarter.
    - >-
      Optional outcome-based bonuses (e.g., small kicker tied to verified
      incremental profit after control-group measurement).
  costStructure:
    - >-
      People: ML engineers, data scientists, data engineers, compliance and
      model risk leads, solution architects, and CS (largest cost).
    - >-
      Cloud infrastructure: model training/serving, data storage; budget for p95
      250 ms real-time SLAs; estimate $0.0002–$0.001 per decision and
      $2k–$10k/month per mid-market client for storage/compute.
    - >-

      enrichment (behavioral/geo) where applicable.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2 Type II, penetration tests, privacy tooling;
      annual budget $75k–$200k.

      platforms.
    - >-
      R&D for connectors and model library maintenance; periodic third-party
      model validations.
  keyMetrics:
    - >-
      Incremental conversion uplift (primary): uplift = conversion_treatment −
      conversion_control; target +50% to +200% relative lift depending on
      product.
    - >-
      Incremental profit per 1,000 offers (IPK): IPK = (conversions_incremental
      × first-year net profit per product) − (offer_costs + platform_costs).
      Example: credit card: 0.6% incremental × $150 = $900 − $200 = $700 per
      1,000 offers.
    - >-
      PPH improvement: +0.1 within 6 months and +0.2–0.5 within 12 months in
      target segments.
    - >-
      Contact efficiency: offers per sale and cost per incremental sale; target
      150–400 offers/sale for credit cards, 1,000–3,000 for HELOC/Mortgage
      depending on eligibility and rates.
    - >-
      Time-to-value: days to first live campaign (<60 days) and to verified
      uplift via RCT (<120 days).
    - >-
      Channel performance: real-time API p95 latency <250 ms; decision
      throughput; channel coverage (% of active users seeing NBA in digital
      channels).
    - >-
      Model quality: AUC >0.70 for propensities, ECE/calibration error <5%,
      weekly drift score, refresh cadence ≤90 days.
    - >-
      Fairness/compliance: demographic parity or equal opportunity ratio ≥0.8
      across monitored segments; opt-out rate <1% per month; complaint rate <5
      per 100k offers; 100% decisions auditable.
    - >-
      Revenue impact: incremental annualized net income from cross-sell; target
      0.05–0.20% of assets in incremental consumer banking net income for mature
      programs.
    - >-
      Adoption: % of frontline using guidance >70%, % of marketing journeys with
      RCT >80%.
storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Growth, marketing, and product leaders at banks, credit unions, and savings
    institutions who need to deepen relationships and grow share‑of‑wallet
    without spamming customers or risking compliance.
  problem: >-
    External: Generic, batch campaigns underperform; data is siloed; timing is
    off; channels are disjointed; compliance is strict. Internal: Pressure to
    hit growth targets on tight budgets with audit scrutiny. Philosophical:
    Depositors deserve timely, relevant, and fair offers that respect their
    privacy and preferences.
  guide: >-
    We understand regulated growth is hard—margins are thin and scrutiny is
    high. Our team blends bank, credit union, and fintech experience; our
    platform is secure and explainable, with model governance, audit trails, and
    fairness checks proven in production with depository institutions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & govern: Securely unify core, CRM, and digital banking data;
    capture consent and eligibility. 2) Predict & prioritize: AI propensities
    plus business rules to choose the compliant next‑best‑action for each
    depositor. 3) Orchestrate & optimize: Deliver personalized offers across
    digital, branch, and contact center; measure, learn, and improve. Agreement:
    clear KPIs, privacy‑first DPA/SLA, no black box.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 60‑day pilot. Transitional: Request
    a free opportunity map and compliance brief.
  success: >-
    Higher products‑per‑household and conversion, lower acquisition cost,
    consistent cross‑channel experiences, increased deposit stickiness and
    balances, faster growth with audit‑ready documentation and confident teams.
  failure: >-
    Continued spray‑and‑pray outreach, low conversion, rising attrition, lost
    wallet share to challengers, wasted marketing spend, and greater compliance
    exposure.
