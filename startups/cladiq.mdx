  problem:
    - >-
      Manual siding takeoffs take 60–120 minutes on-site plus back-office time;
      complex elevations (gable ends, dormers, bump-outs) drive re-visits and
      schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Measurement errors lead to 3–7% material variance, causing $300–$1,500/job
      over/under-buys and re-stocking charges; wasted trips to supply houses
      cost an extra 1–2 crew-hours.
    - >-
      Contractors lose 10–20% of potential wins due to slow quoting (1–3 day
      delays); homeowners now expect same-day quotes with visuals.
    - >-
      Translating areas into SKU-level BOMs (by manufacturer, profile, color,
      trim, corner posts, J-channel, flashing, housewrap) is tedious and
      error-prone; accessory miscounts are common.
    - >-
      Multi-tenant and light commercial jobs require lift planning and staging;
      lack of accurate elevations increases safety risk and change orders.
    - >-
      Existing tools are roofing-centric or require strict photo capture
      workflows; siding teams need elevation-first accuracy, accessory counts,
      and flexible inputs (homeowner photos, drone shots, aerial imagery).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven elevation extraction and plane detection from photos/aerials;
      per-wall area measurement with auto opening detection
      (windows/doors/vents), corner lengths, soffit and fascia edges.
    - >-
      Siding-specific logic: lap exposure settings, panel lengths, starter
      strips, J-channel, corner posts, flashing, housewrap, trim boards;
      configurable waste factors by product/crew preference.
    - >-
      Instant 3D exterior model for sales: visualize profiles, colors, and trim
      packages; export snapshots for proposals.
    - >-
      SKU-accurate BOM generation mapped to major manufacturers and local
      distributor catalogs; CSV/Excel/PDF exports and direct quote requests to
      distributor partners.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option for high-stakes bids; SLA-backed turnaround
      (standard <2 hours, rush <30 minutes).
    - >-
      Integrations: push measurements and BOMs into JobNimbus/AccuLynx; sync
      proposals to CRMs; API for franchises and estimating platforms.
    - >-
      Capture flexibility: homeowner photo link (guided capture), drone upload,
      or auto-fetch high-res oblique aerials where available.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    The fastest path from photos to a manufacturer-ready siding BOM and 3D
    homeowner model—accurate to ±2% area, delivered in under 2 hours, from any
    mix of homeowner photos, drone shots, or aerial imagery.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A siding-specific labeled dataset and BOM logic engine mapped to top
    manufacturer SKUs, reinforced by distributor partnerships and CRM
    integrations. Continuous learning from real contractor corrections creates a
    defensible accuracy flywheel and higher-quality BOMs than generic
    photo-to-3D tools.
