  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive via email/portals in mixed formats (PDF/Excel/CSV/text) and
      require manual parsing, cross-referencing SKUs, pack sizes, colors, and
      units of measure, causing 4–24 hour quote turnaround times.
    - >-
      Inventory and cost checks are fragmented across ERP, WMS, supplier
      catalogs, and spreadsheets; alternates/substitutes are inconsistently
      suggested, lowering fill rates and win rates.
    - >-
      Pricing policies (MOQ, breaks, contract/special pricing, freight,
      currency, lead-time buffers) are applied manually, creating errors and
      margin leakage.
    - >-
      Sales teams spend 30–50% of time on administrative quoting tasks, limiting
      outbound selling and follow-ups.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly expect fast, accurate quotes; slow responses reduce
      conversion and damage relationships.
    - >-
      Portals require repetitive data entry and navigation; lack of automation
      creates throughput bottlenecks during peak demand.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel RFQ intake: monitored mailboxes, API, SFTP, and portal
      automation (headless browser/RPA) to capture requests and attachments.
    - >-
      Document/line-item extraction with domain-tuned models: SKUs,
      descriptions, colorways, widths, fiber content, UOM conversions
      (yard/roll/cone), pack sizes, requested dates, and delivery terms.
    - >-
      Availability and cost orchestration: live checks against ERP/WMS
      inventory, supplier lead times, landed cost (including FX, duty, and
      freight profiles).
    - >-
      Alternates/substitutions engine: attribute and MPN cross-referencing to
      propose in-stock equivalents by color/width/brand/quality tier with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Pricing policy engine: MOQs, price breaks, contract pricing,
      customer-specific pricing, margin targets, and freight/lead-time rules;
      guardrails prevent margin leakage.
    - >-
      Quote composer: returns branded quotes (PDF/Excel/email), portal form
      fill, or EDI where applicable; includes pricing, lead times, validity, and
      alternates.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: confidence thresholds, exception queues, audit trail,
      approvals, and versioning; easy accept/override and send.
    - >-
      Closed-loop CRM/ERP updates: write-back of quotes, probabilities, and line
      items; track acceptance; create follow-up tasks and pipeline impact.
    - >-
      Observability and QA: extraction accuracy dashboards, turnaround times,
      SLA, and automation rate; retraining loops from human corrections.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn emailed/portal RFQs into accurate, margin-optimized quotes in minutes
    with human-in-the-loop controls, real-time availability/cost checks, and
    smart substitutes tailored to piece goods and notions. Outcome: 70%+
    automation in 90 days, median quote time under 10 minutes, +10–20% quote
    win-rate uplift, and 1–2 pp margin improvement.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Accumulating domain data network effects (RFQ patterns, attribute
    taxonomies, alternate/acceptance feedback) combined with certified ERP
    connectors and substitution intelligence purpose-built for textiles/notions.
    Over time, this yields higher extraction accuracy, smarter alternates, and
    better margin/lead-time predictions than generic IDP/RPA or horizontal CPQ
    tools.

    Quoting teams at piece goods, notions, and dry goods wholesalers who need to
    turn RFQs into accurate quotes in minutes without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    - External — RFQs flood in via email and buyer portals while item data and
    costs sit in ERP and vendor lists; manual lookups and spreadsheets are slow
    and error‑prone.

    - Internal — Teams feel overwhelmed, miss cutoffs, and worry about
    inconsistent pricing and lead times.

    - Philosophical — Buyers deserve fast, accurate, transparent quotes; no one
    should lose business because admin gets in the way.

    sizes, colorways, MOQs, pack sizes, substitutions.

    enterprise‑grade controls.

    lead‑time logic, and approval thresholds.

    3) Go live — AI parses RFQs, checks stock/costs, suggests alternates, and
    returns a formatted quote with pricing and lead times; your team reviews
    exceptions.

    Optional pilot — Start with one product line and expand.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct — Schedule a 20‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot.

    - Transitional — Free RFQ audit and sample quote simulation using anonymized
    emails.
  success: >-
    - Quotes go out in minutes, 24/7, including after hours.

    - Higher win rate and revenue from faster responses and intelligent
    alternates.

    - Fewer errors and chargebacks; standardized pricing and approvals.

    - Reps spend time selling, not copy‑pasting; lower cost per quote.

    - Full audit trail and analytics on hit rate, margins, and SLAs.
  failure: |-
    - Slow replies persist and buyers choose faster competitors.
    - Quote backlog grows and staff burnout rises.
    - Pricing mistakes erode margins and trust.
    - Missed alternates leave money on the table.
