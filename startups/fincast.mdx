  problem:
    - >-
      High spoilage and shrink (often 10–20% of COGS in fresh seafood) due to
      over-ordering and inaccurate forecasts.
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts of high-margin species/cuts during demand spikes
      (weather, holidays, events), causing lost sales and reduced customer
      loyalty.
    - >-
      Manual, experience-based ordering that doesn’t scale across locations or
      buyers and breaks with staff turnover.
    - >-
      Vendor lead-time variability and shelf-life constraints make generic
      retail forecasting tools underperform for seafood.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true daily SKU demand drivers (weather, local
      events, seasonality, promotions, price changes, holidays).
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop ordering and safety-stock discipline leads to
      inconsistent service levels and wasted working capital.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily/weekly SKU-level demand forecasting by species, cut, and prep method
      with weather-, holiday-, and event-aware features.
    - >-
      Dynamic safety stock and reorder point optimization targeting 95–98%
      service levels by SKU while respecting shelf-life constraints.
    - >-
      Auto-generated purchase orders aligned to vendor MOQs, lead times, and
      delivery calendars; push to ERP/POS/EDI.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop using sales, spoilage, returns, and substitutions
      to improve accuracy and reduce bias.
    - >-
      Scenario planning for promotions, price changes, and supply shocks (e.g.,
      short landings, season closures).
    - >-
      Operational workflow: exceptions dashboard, alerts for at-risk SKUs, and
      explainable recommendations to build buyer trust.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce seafood shrink 20–35% and stockouts 30–50% with species- and
    cut-level AI forecasts and auto-generated purchase orders and safety stock
    calibrated to shelf-life, lead times, and local demand drivers. Payback in
    under 12 weeks for a typical seafood counter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A seafood-specific forecasting and ordering engine that combines
    shelf-life-aware optimization with hyperlocal demand signals and closed-loop
    PO execution, continuously trained on cross-retailer, species-level spoilage
    and substitution data. Fast time-to-value (pilot in weeks, not months) and
    explainable recommendations build buyer trust in a category where generic
    retail tools underperform.
