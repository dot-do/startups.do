  problem:
    - >-
      Inaccurate, map-only ETAs ignore towing-specific delays (gated lots,
      police scenes, winch-outs, load time), causing 10–20+ minute errors and
      missed SLAs.
    - >-
      Missed motor club SLAs lead to penalties, lower scorecards, and reduced
      call allocations/revenue for towers.
    - >-
      High call volume from customers and clubs (“Where’s my truck?”) consumes
      dispatcher time (10–30% of inbound calls) and increases labor costs.
    - >-
      Dispatchers manually push updates via phone/text; lack of automation
      creates inconsistency and human error during busy periods.
    - >-
      No early warning on at-risk jobs; dispatchers discover SLA breaches too
      late to reassign or reprioritize.
    - >-
      Drivers receive over-optimistic ETAs, creating unsafe rushing and morale
      issues when ETAs must be repeatedly revised.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (GPS, dispatch, club portals) limit visibility; data is
      not leveraged to learn and improve ETAs over time.
    - >-
      Basic telematics ETAs don’t model on-scene/service time, driver/truck
      capabilities, or club-specific SLA rules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest data in real time: driver GPS/AVL, dispatch status (assigned/en
      route/on scene/tow start/clear), job attributes (vehicle, service type,
      pickup context), traffic, weather.
    - >-
      Towing-specific ETA model: predicts travel + on-scene + hookup/load +
      tow-out + drop-off times; adjusts by driver history, truck capability
      (flatbed/wrecker/HD), terrain, time-of-day, police involvement.
    - >-
      SLA risk scoring: continuously predicts probability of breach vs
      club/operator SLA; flags at-risk jobs with lead time and recommends
      actions (reassign, priority lane, notify).
    - >-
      Proactive notifications: automated SMS/IVR/push with live tracking link,
      driver ETA window, and two-way options (confirm, add notes, reschedule).
      Escalation rules for delays.
    - >-
      Dispatcher command center: map of active jobs, color-coded SLA risk, ETA
      deltas, bulk actions, and “what-if” reassignment impact simulation.
    - >-
      Club/OEM integrations: push status/ETA updates via APIs/EDI to reduce
      manual portal updates; align with club-specific codes and KPIs.
    - >-
      Analytics: accuracy dashboards (MAE/P90 error), on-time SLA rates by
      driver/region/club, call deflection, customer CSAT, and ROI calculators.
    - >-
      SDK/APIs: drop-in modules for driver apps and ISVs; webhooks for
      status/notifications and embeddable customer tracking pages.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built ETA and SLA risk engine for towing that combines live
    GPS/traffic with towing-specific service-time modeling to deliver 2x more
    accurate ETAs and automated, proactive notifications—reducing “Where’s my
    truck?” calls by 30–50% and improving on-time SLA by 10–20 points to boost
    club scorecards and job allocations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A towing-specific ETA/service-time model trained on cross-operator,
    cross-club datasets with bi-directional integrations that most competitors
    lack, producing materially better accuracy and SLA risk lead time; embedded
    in the operator and club workflows to create switching costs via operational
    scorecards, automation rules, and benchmarks.
