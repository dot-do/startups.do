  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable lock waits (often 2–10+ hours) and river conditions cause
      missed ETAs, higher fuel burn, and demurrage costs.
    - >-
      Dispatchers rely on manual calls, USACE pages, and experience; insights
      are not standardized or predictive beyond a few hours.
    - >-
      Existing AIS-based tracking lacks inland-specific ETA accuracy and rarely
      incorporates lock queues, river stage/flow, and maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Operators lack early-warning signals to shift departure times or reroute
      before congestion forms at choke-point locks.
    - >-
      Shippers and terminals cannot reliably plan labor, berth windows, and
      cargo readiness; buffers drive idle time and cost.
    - >-
      No common, neutral data layer to benchmark lane-level performance and
      quantify delay risk for contracts and schedules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-source data: terrestrial/satellite AIS, USACE lock
      queue/lockages, river stage/flow/forecast (USGS/NOAA), Notices to
      Navigation Interests, maintenance schedules, weather/wind, historical
      traffic.
    - >-
      Train route- and lock-specific ML models that forecast: 1) lock wait times
      (15-min granularity, up to 72 hours), 2) end-to-end ETA distributions, 3)
      congestion risk scores at key choke points.
    - >-
      Optimize advisory engine to recommend departure-time shifts, speed
      adjustments, and alternate lock sequences when benefits exceed thresholds
      (e.g., >45 minutes saved).
    - >-
      Deliver alerts and recommendations via: dispatcher web app, pilot
      mobile/ECdis plugin, and REST/streaming APIs for TMS/FMS integration.
    - >-
      Provide analytics layer: post-voyage comparisons vs baseline, savings
      attribution (fuel, demurrage, crew overtime), and reliability benchmarking
      by lane/season/lock.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from realized arrivals, actual lockages, and operator
      feedback to improve model accuracy and tailor to fleet behavior.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, lock-aware ETAs and wait-time forecasts that cut avoidable delay
    by 10–20%, with proactive departure/route advice and real-time alerts,
    delivered via APIs and tools dispatchers and pilots already use.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A lock- and corridor-specific learning system fed by multi-operator feedback
    loops and realized outcomes, combined with exclusive integration footprints
    and historical datasets that competitors without operator partnerships
    cannot easily replicate.

    Towboat captains, dispatchers, and fleet managers moving inland water
    freight who need reliable ETAs, fewer lock delays, and tighter control of
    fuel and crew hours.
  problem: >-
    Lock queues and river conditions change fast; manual ETA guesses and
    scattered AIS data lead to missed windows, wasted fuel, crew overtime, and
    unhappy shippers.
  guide: >-
    We understand how idle hours crush margins. Our AI, trained on AIS, USACE
    lock queues, and river stage/flow data, forecasts ETAs and lock waits—and
    proactively suggests smarter departures and routes with timely alerts.
  plan: >-
    Connect your AIS and choose lanes; receive ETA and lock-delay forecasts with
    confidence signals; act on reroute/departure alerts via app or API; monitor
    performance and savings in your ops dashboard.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or start a limited pilot to begin receiving forecasts and alerts
    on your highest-variance lanes.
  success: >-
    On-time deliveries with fewer lock waits, lower idle and fuel burn, steadier
    crew schedules, more turns per tow, and proactive ETAs your shippers can
    trust.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing ETAs, idling in surprise queues, burning fuel and crew time,
    missing commitments, and losing loads to better-informed competitors.

  problem:
    - >-
      Lock queues change hourly; dispatch is forced to rely on stale reports and
      guesswork.
