  problem:
    - >-
      Marketers and designers spend 4–10 hours/week per brand resizing,
      reformatting, and exporting creatives for multiple platforms (Instagram,
      TikTok, LinkedIn, X, Pinterest, Facebook, YouTube).
    - >-
      Platform specs and ad policies change frequently, causing rework and
      rejections (costing campaigns 1–3 days of delay).
    - >-
      Maintaining brand consistency (fonts, colors, logo usage, tone) across
      teams and agencies is error-prone without centralized guardrails.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (e.g., alcohol/finance/health disclosures, claims,
      copyrighted assets) lead to rejected ads and potential fines.
    - >-
      Scheduling requires switching tools (design app → compliance checklist →
      scheduler), creating handoff friction and missed posting windows.
    - >-
      Marketing teams need higher content velocity (2–5x more posts) without
      proportional headcount increases.
    - >-
      Lack of performance feedback at the creative-variant level limits learning
      and iteration speed.
  solution:
    - >-
      Brand Guardrails: Ingest a brand kit (logo, fonts, color palette, voice)
      and lock guardrails; auto-enforce across all creatives.
    - >-
      Prompt-to-Post: Generate designs from a brief or URL; produce multiple
      on-brand variants with headlines/captions.
    - >-
      Auto-Resize/Format: One-click resizing for each platform/placement with
      smart focal-point cropping and safe-area detection.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-Design: Real-time policy scanner (platform + regional +
      brand rules) with auto-fixes (disclaimers, contrast, logo clearspace).
    - >-
      Collaborate & Approve: Workflow with roles, comments, redlines, and audit
      logs; export to DAM or schedule directly.
    - >-
      Auto-Schedule & Optimize: Post at predicted best times, attach UTM tags,
      and push to all linked channels through native integrations.
    - >-
      Creative Analytics: Variant-level performance insights; recommendations
      for next iterations tied to KPIs (CTR, CPC, ROAS, engagement).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create on-brand, policy-safe social posts in minutes—auto-designed,
    auto-resized, and auto-scheduled with measurable performance lift.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A closed-loop system combining a brand consistency engine, compliance
    knowledge graph, and creative-performance dataset that continuously learns
    which on-brand layouts/messages drive results by platform and
    industry—creating compounding advantages and switching costs for teams that
    rely on their own historical data.

    Busy marketing teams, social media managers, and founders who need to
    publish consistent, on-brand posts across platforms without design
    bottlenecks.
  problem: >-
    - External: Every platform has different specs and policies; manual resizing
    and compliance checks are slow.

    - Internal: Deadlines slip, the brand looks inconsistent, and time is wasted
    on repetitive edits.

    full-time designer.
