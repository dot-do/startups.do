leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven PO creation for 10k–100k SKUs per DC causes
      chronic over/under-ordering and long buyer cycles (2–4 hours/day/buyer on
      admin).
    - >-
      Volatile demand (promotions, weather, holidays), variable lead times,
      pack-size/MOQ constraints, and vendor price breaks are hard to optimize
      simultaneously.
    - >-
      Supplier confirmations (EDI 855), ship notices (EDI 856), and invoices
      (EDI 810) are inconsistently managed; exceptions and shortages are
      resolved via email/phone with poor traceability.
    - >-
      Excess working capital is tied up in inventory; low service-level fill
      rates (e.g., 95–97%) lead to stockouts and retailer penalties or
      substitutions.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP, WMS, EDI VANs, and spreadsheets; limited
      forecasting accuracy and no continuous learning from
      confirmations/variances.
    - >-
      Labor shortages and turnover make tribal knowledge (e.g., vendor nuances,
      promo lifts) brittle; onboarding new buyers is slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate once with ERP/WMS and EDI network; continuously ingest sales,
      on-hand, open POs, vendor catalogs, price breaks, lead times, and
      promotions.
    - >-
      Forecast demand at SKU/DC with promo/event lifts; combine ML with
      rule-based seasonality and perishability constraints.
    - >-
      Constrained order optimization: MOQ/case-pack, truck/build constraints,
      vendor calendars, price breaks, shelf-life, target service levels, budget
      caps, and cash terms.
    - >-
      Autocreate POs in ERP and transmit via EDI 850/email/portal; bot
      requests/ingests 855s, follows up on missing confirmations, and proposes
      subs on shortages.
    - >-
      Exception management: Buyer receives prioritized queue for only
      high-impact exceptions (e.g., large variances, DC capacity conflicts).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: Update lead times, reliability, and forecast
      parameters from vendor confirmations, ASNs, and invoice variances.
    - >-
      Analytics and governance: Vendor scorecards (OTIF, confirmation latency,
      variance rate), service-level dashboards, and audit trails for SOX/SOC2.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Autonomous, explainable PO creation that optimizes demand, constraints, and
    cash, plus a vendor collaboration bot that accelerates confirmations and
    resolves shortages. Typical outcomes within 90 days: 5–10% lower on-hand
    inventory, 20–30% reduction in out-of-stocks on promoted items, 50–70% less
    buyer admin time, ≥95% PO confirmations within 24 hours, and measurable OTIF
    improvements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built for general line grocery wholesale with a continuously
    learning reliability graph (lead times, confirmation latency, variance
    patterns) across vendors and categories, combined with prebuilt EDI/ERP
    connectors and an explainable, constraint-aware optimizer. Network effects
    improve vendor responsiveness and substitution quality across customers
    while preserving data privacy through aggregation/anonymization.
