leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Marina transient pricing is largely static or adjusted manually, leading
      to underpricing on peak days and overpricing in shoulder periods; missed
      revenue is estimated at 8–20%.
    - >-
      Occupancy forecasting is ad‑hoc; managers lack reliable, slip‑class-level
      demand forecasts to staff appropriately and set rates confidently.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PMS, booking marketplaces, spreadsheets, and
      weather/event sources, making pricing decisions slow and error‑prone.
    - >-
      Short booking windows and weather/event volatility cause rapid demand
      swings that current rules-based tools fail to capture.
    - >-
      Multi-class constraints (length, beam, draft, power, amenities) make
      optimization complex; staff lack time and tooling for granular decisions.
    - >-
      Operators need measurable RevPAS growth without adding slips or headcount;
      owners demand transparent ROI and defensible methodology.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI occupancy forecasting at daily granularity (2–120‑day horizon) by slip
      class, channel, and length band, with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing engine modeling price elasticity and pickup pace;
      publishes rate recommendations or auto‑updates PMS/marketplaces under
      user‑defined rules.
    - >-
      Multi‑constraint optimizer honoring min/max rates, parity, blackout dates,
      length/draft limits, live availability, and municipal policies.
    - >-
      External signal ingestion: weather, wind, tidal factors, events, holidays,
      school breaks, AIS traffic trends; competitor rate scraping where
      permitted.
    - >-
      Closed‑loop experiment framework (A/B by date/class) to quantify
      incremental revenue; ROI dashboard with RevPAS, ADR/ft, occupancy, and
      uplift.
    - >-
      Playbooks: peak‑day surge, shoulder‑season fill, last‑minute markdowns,
      storm freeze, event‑week premiums, length‑band mix optimization.
    - >-
      Alerting and workflows: exception queues, approval flows, and audit trails
      for rate changes; recommended actions with expected impact.
    - >-
      Benchmarks: anonymized comp‑set index for occupancy and ADR/ft to guide
      strategy without exposing individual marina data.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hotel-grade revenue management for marinas: forecast demand by slip class
    and auto‑optimize transient rates to lift RevPAS 10–15% within 90
    days—without more slips or staff, with full control and transparency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Marina‑specific optimization IP and aggregated, anonymized multi‑marina
    dataset that improves forecasts and elasticity estimates over time;
    certified deep integrations with leading PMS/marketplaces and proven A/B
    uplift methodology create defensible switching costs and network effects via
    cross‑marina benchmarks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Marina owners, GMs, and dockmasters who want to fill the right slips at the
    right price, grow transient revenue, and keep boaters happy—without living
    in spreadsheets.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile demand from weather, events, and seasons; static rates
    by slip class; last‑minute bookings; fragmented inventory.

    - Internal: Uncertainty about what to charge and when; fear of empty slips
    or underpricing peak days; time lost to manual updates.

    - Philosophical: Waterfront operators deserve airline‑grade pricing tools;
    fair prices should match real demand and value.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand tides, regattas, and holidays can upend a static
    pricing calendar and stress your team.

    - Authority: Built by marina ops and pricing engineers; forecasts occupancy
    by slip class using bookings, tides, local events, and weather; integrates
    with your PMS or CSV; recommendations are transparent and auditable.
  plan: >-
    - Process:
      1) Connect bookings and slip inventory (API/CSV) and define slip classes.
      2) Calibrate models with history and local demand drivers; set guardrails (min/max, lead‑time, stay length, blackout dates).
      3) Go live: publish rate recommendations, set overrides, get alerts; review weekly insights to fine‑tune.
    - Agreement: You keep price control; no long lock‑ins; data is secure; clear
    ROI checkpoints and human support.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a demo; start a 30‑day pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the marina revenue playbook; get a free 90‑day
    demand forecast snapshot; try the RevPS calculator.
  success: >-
    - Higher revenue per slip and healthier occupancy across classes.

    - Confident, faster pricing decisions with fewer last‑minute scrambles.

    - Time saved for staff and better guest experience.

    - Clear forecasts for staffing, fuel, and retail planning; defensible
    budgets and reporting.
  failure: |-
    - Empty slips in shoulder periods and peak days sold out too cheaply.
    - Endless spreadsheet edits and guesswork.
    - Frustrated staff and guests; missed revenue; no visibility to plan ahead.
