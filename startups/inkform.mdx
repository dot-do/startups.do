leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      R&D cycles to meet new performance and regulatory targets are slow (8–16
      weeks) and experiment-heavy (50–150 lab runs per project).
    - >-
      Generic DoE tools don’t capture ink-specific mixture/process constraints
      (e.g., pigment/resin/solvent/additive interactions, shear-rate dependent
      viscosity, cure kinetics).
    - >-
      Balancing multi-objective trade-offs (color ΔE*, gloss, adhesion,
      rub/abrasion resistance, viscosity window, cost, VOC/migration limits) is
      manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Frequent raw-material changes (price volatility, supplier backorders, new
      regulatory restrictions) force re-formulation with limited decision
      support.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across ELN/LIMS/Excel; lessons from prior programs aren’t
      re-used effectively; expert attrition drains tacit knowledge.
    - >-
      Inefficient DoE designs waste samples and time (overly large factorials,
      underpowered or non-mixture-aware designs).
    - >-
      Regulatory risk increases time and cost (TSCA, REACH/SVHC, EuPIA Exclusion
      Policy, Prop 65, food-packaging migration guidance).
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest historical formulations, raw-material properties, lab results, and
      cost data via connectors to ELN/LIMS/ERP; build customer-specific models
      seeded with ink-focused pretrained models.
    - >-
      Generate minimal, constrained mixture-process DoEs
      (Scheffé/I-optimal/D-optimal) that respect component ranges, functional
      ratios (e.g., pigment/resin), and process variables (shear, temperature,
      cure).
    - >-
      Active-learning loop: run initial small DoE, update models with results,
      and propose the next smallest batch to converge to multi-objective
      targets.
    - >-
      Embed regulatory and EHS policy engine (TSCA/REACH/EuPIA/Prop 65;
      migration/VOC constraints) that filters/scores ingredient choices by
      region and application.
    - >-
      Optimize for cost and availability by incorporating current supplier
      pricing, MOQs, lead times, and approved substitutions.
    - >-
      One-click technical plan and report: recipe tables, predicted properties
      with confidence intervals, DoE matrix, desirability charts, and compliance
      summary.
    - >-
      Integrations with lab instruments (rheometers/viscometers,
      spectrophotometers, gloss meters) for automated data capture and model
      retraining.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-tuned AI that proposes the smallest validated set of experiments to
    hit performance, cost, and regulatory targets for printing inks—cutting lab
    runs by 30–50% and time-to-formulation by 40–60%, with auditable, compliant,
    and supply-aware recommendations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization stack—mixture-aware active-learning models
    pretrained on ink systems, coupled with a living regulatory/supply engine
    and validated instrument/LIMS integrations—delivering a provable
    minimal-experiment path to target specs that generic DoE or
    materials-informatics platforms cannot match.
