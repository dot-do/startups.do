  title: Demand Forecasting & Smart Batching Planner
  description: >-
    Forecast hourly demand by zone and auto-suggest courier shifts and batch
    sizes to minimize miles per drop and missed SLAs.
  targetUsers:
    - Operations planners
    - Small courier owners

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile hourly demand by neighborhood leads to overstaffing in slow hours
      and shortages in peaks, causing 20–40% higher cost per drop and missed
      SLAs.
    - >-
      Dispatchers rely on spreadsheets, intuition, or daily averages that ignore
      weather, events, holidays, and promotions, leading to 25–50% WAPE at the
      hour x zone level.
    - >-
      Batching is often static (e.g., cap of 2–3 orders) and doesn’t adapt to
      courier supply, travel times, or SLA buffers, increasing miles per drop
      and re-deliveries.
    - >-
      COOs lack forward visibility (next 2–6 weeks) to plan hiring, shift bids,
      and overtime, causing 10–20% avoidable labor spend.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop feedback between forecast, schedule, and actuals
      prevents continuous improvement and makes root-cause analysis slow and
      anecdotal.
    - >-
      Integrations between POS/ordering, dispatch/route optimization, and
      workforce management are brittle, requiring manual data wrangling for
      planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hourly, zone-level demand forecasting incorporating order history,
      weather, events, promotions, holidays, lead-time mix, and store hours.
    - >-
      Auto-suggested courier rosters: shift counts, start times, durations, and
      skill mix to hit target SLA and cost per drop, respecting labor rules and
      break policies.
    - >-
      Smart batching policy engine that adapts batch size by time/zone based on
      real-time supply, travel times, and SLA buffers to minimize miles per
      drop.
    - >-
      Rolling re-forecast every 15 minutes that updates staffing gaps and
      batching rules; alerting to dispatch when variance exceeds thresholds.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate promo calendars, weather shocks, or store
      openings; compare KPI trade-offs (SLA vs utilization vs cost).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest actuals (orders, ETAs, missed SLAs, courier
      locations) to retrain and improve zone-hour accuracy weekly.
    - >-
      Lightweight web console and API; integrations with dispatch/route
      optimization and workforce management to push shifts and policies
      automatically.
    - >-
      Analytics and RCA: variance decomposition by zone-hour (forecast error vs.
      staffing vs. batching), and savings attribution.
    - >-
      Safe-guard rails: SLA bands, hot orders prioritization, fairness
      constraints across couriers, union and city compliance rules.
    - >-
      Playbooks and templates for common patterns (lunch/dinner peaks, Sunday
      slumps, rain-day spikes, stadium events).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce miles per drop 10–20% and SLA misses 25–50% by forecasting hourly
    demand at the zone level and auto-suggesting courier shifts and adaptive
    batch sizes—plugging into your existing dispatch stack and delivering
    measurable ROI in under 30 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-operator, privacy-preserving dataset and transfer-learning models that
    generalize to new zones quickly; a closed-loop planner that links forecast →
    shifts → batching with real-time re-forecasting and attribution, integrated
    natively with leading dispatch and WFM platforms—resulting in faster
    time-to-value and compounding accuracy improvements competitors can’t easily
    replicate.

  character: >-
    Operations leaders at local messenger and same‑day delivery services who
    must hit SLAs at the lowest cost.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile, hyperlocal demand; blind spots by hour and zone;
    inefficient batching; over/under‑staffing; high miles per drop; missed SLAs.

    - Internal: Tired of spreadsheet guesswork, gut‑feel dispatching, and

    last‑mile operators and data scientists; trusted by local fleets to plan
    with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data (order history, OMS/POS, zones, SLAs; optional
    weather/events).

    2) Receive hourly forecasts by zone plus recommended shifts and batch sizes
    to hit targets.

    3) Publish to dispatch, monitor adherence, and auto‑adjust as demand
    changes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot. Transitional:
    Download the Last‑Mile Planning Playbook and explore the forecast sandbox.
