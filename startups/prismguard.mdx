  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection of molded/stamped noncurrent-carrying wiring
      device parts is labor-intensive, subjective, and inconsistent across
      shifts and plants
    - >-
      Cosmetic defects (scratches, short-shots, sink marks, flash, paint/powder
      defects) create rework, scrap, and customer returns that erode margin and
      brand reputation
    - >-
      Inline vision automation is costly and disruptive; teams need an offline
      assist tool that works with existing benches, cameras, and lighting
    - >-
      General-purpose vision tools require large labeled datasets and constant
      tuning; they struggle with low-contrast plastics, glossy finishes,
      textured surfaces, and paint color variation
    - >-
      Lack of traceability and structured defect data hinders SPC, root cause
      analysis, and supplier quality programs
    - >-
      Small and mid-size suppliers lack in-house ML expertise to build and
      maintain robust models and MLOps pipelines
  solution:
    - >-
      Paid pilot with success criteria: collect 2–5k representative images per
      defect class and good parts; label via our tooling and SME review;
      establish pass/fail thresholds by severity tier
    - >-
      Train domain-specific models (scratches, short-shot, sink, flash,
      paint/powder) with synthetic augmentation and lighting normalization;
      benchmark against human inspectors and target recall/precision KPIs
    - >-
      Deploy on a local Windows or Linux workstation with a mid-range GPU or our
      edge appliance; supports image uploads and real-time frame sampling from
      USB/industrial cameras
    - >-
      Operator app presents go/no-go with heatmaps; configurable defect taxonomy
      and severity; automatic capture of evidence for every fail for audit and
      supplier feedback
    - >-
      Integrations: export to CSV/SQL, REST API to MES/ERP (e.g., Ignition,
      Tulip), optional barcode association for lot/SKU traceability
    - >-
      Continuous improvement loop: active learning from operator overrides;
      drift monitoring; quarterly model refresh or on-demand retrains within 5
      business days
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-tuned, offline vision AI that flags cosmetic defects on wiring device
    components with high recall and low false positives using your existing
    benches and cameras, delivering measurable scrap/rework reduction and
    traceable defect data in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset and pretrained model library specific to
    wiring device components and finishes (plastics and painted metals), plus a
    synthetic-defect generator tuned for short-shots, sink, flash, and paint
    anomalies; validated deployment playbooks that achieve ≥98% critical-defect
    recall with low FP under real plant lighting using commodity cameras; and
    references within NAICS 335932 enabling faster pilots and lower data
    requirements than general-purpose vision tools.

  character: >-
    Ops and Quality leaders at noncurrent-carrying wiring device manufacturers
    (NAICS 335932) who want fast, consistent cosmetic pre-screening of
    molded/stamped parts without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    - External: Scratches, short-shots, sink marks, flash, and paint defects are
    hard to catch consistently with manual inspection of images/video frames.

    - Internal: Teams worry about escapes, rework, overtime, and auditor
    findings while trying to keep lines moving.

    - Philosophical: Quality should be objective, predictable, and affordable
    for every part, every shift.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pressure to keep throughput high while eliminating
    cosmetic escapes.

    - Authority: Industrial computer-vision and MLOps expertise; domain-trained
    models for molded/stamped parts; secure on-prem or cloud hosting; offline
    assist augments inspectors—no PLC integration or line downtime required.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Share sample images/video frames and define defect criteria.

    2) We label data and train a model to flag scratches, short-shots, sink
    marks, flash, and paint defects.

    3) Pilot offline pre-screen: model flags, human confirms; tune thresholds.

    4) Deploy via upload portal/API (on-prem or secure cloud).

    5) Monitor performance and continuously improve with your feedback.

    Agreement plan:

    - Agreed metrics (precision/recall, false-accept/false-reject).

    - Data security and IP protection.

    - Support SLAs and clear pricing (pilot then subscription).
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute discovery call and upload 100–200 sample images
    to start a pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the cosmetic inspection checklist, sample report,
    and ROI estimate template.
  success: |-
    - Consistent, faster inspections with objective pass/fail.
    - Fewer escapes, rework, scrap, and chargebacks.
    - Traceability: defect heatmaps and audit-ready reports.
    - Inspectors focus on edge cases; capacity grows without new headcount.
    - Stronger customer trust and smoother audits.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing inconsistent manual inspection.
    - Missed defects, line stoppages, and costly rework/scrap.
    - Warranty returns and strained customer relationships.
    - Auditor findings, overtime, and hiring pressure.
