  problem:
    - >-
      Tow operators face frequent post-tow damage disputes without defensible,
      time-stamped photo evidence; claims can cost $500–$3,000 each and erode
      contracts.
    - >-
      Dispatchers often send the wrong truck/equipment due to incomplete info
      (e.g., AWD requires flatbed); re-dispatch delays increase costs and SLA
      penalties.
    - >-
      Drivers lack standardized safety and documentation workflows under time
      pressure, leading to missed photos, non-compliant tie-downs, and higher
      incident risk.
    - >-
      Existing photo processes are manual, not tamper-evident, and rarely
      integrated with dispatch/insurer systems, creating administrative burden.
    - >-
      Insurers and roadside networks demand better documentation to reduce fraud
      and speed claims/FNOL, but fleets lack tooling that fits tow workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app/SDK guides drivers to capture a standardized 12–16 photo set in
      under 90 seconds with on-screen framing and completeness scoring.
    - >-
      On-device and cloud vision models detect and label pre-existing exterior
      damage (panels, glass, lights, wheels), estimate severity, and
      time/GPS-stamp results.
    - >-
      License plate and VIN decoding auto-populate vehicle details; drivetrain
      inference (FWD/RWD/AWD) plus curb/ditch angle detection informs equipment
      choice (flatbed, dolly, winch, wheel-lift).
    - >-
      Dynamic checklists recommend tie-down points, PPE, and safety steps based
      on vehicle and scene conditions; require confirmation photos of
      securement.
    - >-
      Tamper-evident chain of custody: cryptographic signing, hash-watermarked
      images, driver ID, and immutable audit trail suitable for
      insurer/litigation use.
    - >-
      One-tap export to dispatch platforms and insurers: job ID linkage, FNOL
      packet (PDF + JSON), and API callbacks; offline-first with auto-sync.
    - >-
      Fleet dashboard for QA, dispute response templates, SLA tracking, and ROI
      reporting (claims avoided, re-dispatch avoided, time saved).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-guided, tamper-evident photo capture that proves pre-existing damage,
    recommends the right towing equipment and safety steps, and plugs directly
    into your dispatch and insurer workflows—cutting damage claims 40–70% and
    wrong-equipment re-dispatches 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A towing-focused, insurer-accepted evidence pipeline with tamper-evident
    capture, exclusive integrations with leading dispatch platforms, and a
    proprietary dataset from real-world tow scenarios (nighttime, roadside
    hazards, AWD/EV securement) that general auto-inspection AI lacks.
