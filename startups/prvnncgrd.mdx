  problem:
    - >-
      Provenance research is fragmented and manual: 10–40 hours per artwork
      across catalogs, archives, news, and databases; quality varies widely.
    - >-
      Dealers face increasing regulatory exposure (UK/EU AML for Art Market
      Participants, U.S. sanctions/OFAC, import/export restrictions) with
      unclear, non-standard processes.
    - >-
      Title, theft, and cultural property risks (restitution, Nazi-era looting,
      illicit antiquities) can kill deals or lead to costly post-sale disputes
      and reputational harm.
    - >-
      Existing tools either cover a single dimension (e.g., stolen art databases
      or generic KYC) or produce non-auditable outputs that insurers, banks, or
      counterparties won’t accept.
    - >-
      Cross-border, multi-language materials (German Fraktur, French, Italian,
      Dutch, etc.) and entity/name variants make research error-prone, slow, and
      expensive.
    - >-
      No continuous monitoring: once a deal is checked, new sanctions, claims,
      or discoveries aren’t surfaced unless re-run manually.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest client materials (PDFs, images, invoices, prior research, emails)
      and auto-OCR with multilingual/classical fonts support.
    - >-
      Aggregate external sources: auction catalogs, gallery records, museum
      collections, periodicals, provenance indices, sanctions/PEP/watchlists,
      stolen art databases, cultural property advisories.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and knowledge graph: normalize artist, owner, dealer,
      and location entities; reconcile variants; build chain-of-custody graph
      with timestamps and confidence scores.
    - >-
      Automated checks: theft/stolen-art (e.g., ALR hit/no hit),
      sanctions/PEP/AML checks on counterparties, import/export restrictions,
      embargoed origin risks, red-flag patterns (gaps 1933–1945, unverifiable
      dealers, unusual transit routes).
    - >-
      Output: standardized, citation-rich report (PDF + data), provenance
      timeline visualization, risk score with rationale, and auditable
      footnotes; includes a checklist mapped to AML/Title best practices.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: optional expert review tier for sensitive cases;
      sign-off produces an insurer/bank-ready report.
    - >-
      Integrations: API/plug-ins for gallery CRMs (Artlogic/ArtBinder), deal
      rooms, insurers, bank portals; monitoring alerts when watchlists or claims
      change.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compliance-grade provenance and due diligence in hours, not weeks: an AI
    agent that turns client docs and public/proprietary sources into a fully
    cited provenance timeline, theft/sanctions checks, and clear risk
    flags—auditable, standardized, and acceptable to counterparties, insurers,
    and lenders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, domain-specific provenance knowledge graph with labeled
    entity/transaction edges and citation snapshots, combined with
    insurer/bank-validated reporting standards and exclusive data/integration
    partnerships. Over time, network effects (more checked works/counterparties,
    higher recall, fewer false flags) create a defensible data moat. Explainable
    models and an auditor-backed methodology increase acceptance where generic
    AI or manual reports fail.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      Secondary: Auction houses (regional and national), art advisors, private
      banks/art-secured lenders, specialty insurers/brokers, museums’

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Art dealers, advisors, and auction professionals who need fast, defensible
    provenance and due diligence to buy and sell with confidence.
  problem: >-
    - External: Provenance records are fragmented; theft, sanctions, and AML
    checks are slow and inconsistent.

    - Internal: Pressure to close deals while fearing title or restitution
    issues creates stress and hesitation.

    - Philosophical: No one should risk reputation or capital because ownership
    history is hard to verify.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the stakes of clean title, client trust, and
    regulatory scrutiny under tight timelines.

    Authority: Domain-trained AI with source-cited outputs, audit trails, and
    optional expert review—aligned to museum and market best practices.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload artwork details and client documents.

    2) AI agent ingests and cross-checks public and licensed sources; compiles
    provenance, theft/sanctions findings, and risk flags.

    3) Receive a documented dossier with citations, confidence notes, and
    recommended next steps; optional ongoing monitoring.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Start a pilot—submit an artwork for a full due diligence dossier.
    - Transitional: Book a demo and get a sample report template.
  success: >-
    Close deals faster with defensible provenance; reduce legal and reputational
    risk; standardize diligence across your team; demonstrate compliance with
    clear citations and auditable reports; win client confidence.
  failure: >-
    Without this, deals stall or fall through, hidden risks surface post-sale,
    exposure to seizure or sanctions grows, hours are lost to manual research,
    and credibility erodes.
