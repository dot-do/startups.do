  problem:
    - >-
      Flat-glass fabricators routinely scrap 10–22% of material on cutting
      lines; most shops lack dynamic, order-aware nesting that reuses remnants
      effectively, leaving 2–5 percentage points of yield on the table.
    - >-
      Frequent changeovers (glass type, thickness, coating orientation, tool)
      and rack/stock changes consume 8–20% of cutting-line time, but current
      schedulers do not optimize sequence to minimize them.
    - >-
      Due-date adherence suffers from siloed nesting (per batch/per shift) and
      manual re-planning; lateness >5% of lines with rush orders leads to
      expedited freight and penalties.
    - >-
      Remnant inventory is poorly tracked/utilized; many shops underuse 15–40%
      of offcuts due to lack of fast matching and machine-specific
      post-processing.
    - >-
      Existing OEM nesting software is machine-centric and not multi-objective
      (yield vs. due dates vs. changeovers vs. handling moves), causing
      suboptimal global plans across lines.
    - >-
      Schedulers lack real-time feedback loops from shop-floor events
      (breakdowns, glass defects, rush jobs), making re-optimization slow (hours
      vs. minutes).
    - >-
      Energy and washer/furnace cleaning cycles increase with coating/thickness
      changes; few tools quantify and minimize energy/cleaning impact in
      planning.
    - >-
      Planners spend 1–3 hours/shift manually batching and sequencing, an
      under-automated, error-prone task.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization engine that jointly solves nesting and sequence
      planning across one or more cutting lines, balancing yield, due dates,
      changeovers, and handling moves.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization: ingest shop-floor events (defect maps, rush
      orders, downtime) and re-plan in minutes with minimal disruption to
      in-process jobs.
    - >-
      Remnant-aware planning: automatic cataloging, tagging, and matching of
      offcuts to future orders; age-out rules and physical location awareness.
    - >-
      Machine-specific post-processors for major glass cutting tables and
      breakout lines (e.g., LiSEC, Hegla, Bottero, Glaston/Bystronic, Intermac),
      ensuring programs run without manual edits.
    - >-
      Coating/thickness-aware batching and sequence to reduce washer/furnace
      cleaning cycles and minimize coated-side handling/orientation errors.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: compare scenarios (e.g., higher yield vs. fewer
      changeovers) and forecast lateness/throughput, energy impact, and labor
      hours.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit: yield, changeover time, on-time-in-full (OTIF), moves/order,
      remnant utilization, and energy per m².

    weeks and proven with a guaranteed ROI pilot.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
