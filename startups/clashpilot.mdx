  title: BIM Clash Triage and Issue Routing
  description: >-
    Prioritizes Navisworks/Revit clashes, groups duplicates, assigns to trades,
    and tracks resolution.
  targetUsers:
    - VDC managers
    - MEP coordinators
    - design-build trades
    - project engineers
  triggers:
    - New clash test export (XML/HTML)
    - New model federation published
    - Coordination meeting prep
  inputs:
    - Clash reports (XML/CSV)
    - Model element metadata (IFC/BCF/Speckle)
    - Area/zone breakdown and milestone dates
  steps:
    - Import clashes and de-duplicate by geometry/element IDs
    - 'Score severity by clearance, system criticality, and schedule zone'
    - Bundle into BCF issues with context images and assignees
    - Push to ACC/BIM 360 Issues; set due dates
    - Weekly digest on unresolved/blocked items
  tools:
    - Navisworks clash XML exports
    - BCF 2.1
    - Autodesk Issues API
    - Speckle API (optional)
    - LLM for summaries
  outputs:
    - Prioritized clash list
    - BCF issue bundle
    - Weekly coordination summary
    - Aging/throughput metrics
  pricingModel:
    - Per model publish
    - Per clash processed (tiered)

  risks:
    - Inconsistent element IDs across models
    - Large model performance limits
    - False prioritization on context-specific tolerances

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Navisworks/Revit clash tests routinely generate 10,000–150,000 issues per
      coordination cycle; manual triage consumes 10–25 hours/week per VDC
      coordinator.
    - >-
      Duplicate/repeat clashes (same condition found across multiple tests or
      cycles) inflate issue lists by 30–60%, obscuring priorities and wasting
      review time.
    - >-
      Manual trade assignment and responsibility routing is error-prone (20–30%
      misrouted), causing rework, reopen rates, and schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Severity/impact is inconsistently judged, making it difficult to focus on
      critical clashes (e.g., structural/MEP path conflicts in critical zones).
    - >-
      Fragmented issue tracking across Navisworks, Revizto, BIM Collaborate, and
      Procore leads to stale statuses and poor accountability.
    - >-
      Lack of measurable KPIs (cycle time, auto-resolution rate, reopen rate)
      hinders continuous improvement and executive visibility.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered deduplication that groups repeat/duplicate clashes across
      tests, models, and cycles (target: 50–70% list reduction).
    - >-
      Impact scoring that ranks clashes by schedule/constructability risk using
      system type, location criticality (e.g., risers, corridors), and proximity
      to critical path zones.
    - >-
      Automated trade/responsible-party assignment using element metadata, file
      naming, CSI/UniFormat mapping, and historical routing accuracy feedback.
    - >-
      Two-way sync with Autodesk BIM Collaborate/ACC Model Coordination,
      Revizto, BIM Track, Solibri, and Procore Coordination Issues via BCF 2.1
      and native APIs.
    - >-
      Workflow automation (SLAs, reminders, standup reports, RFI escalation)
      with Teams/Slack bots and email digests.
    - >-
      Dashboards for cycle time, overdue rate, reopen rate, and percent
      auto-resolved; exportable to Power BI for project and portfolio reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn 50,000 clashes into an actionable, routed punchlist in
    minutes—deduplicated, prioritized by impact, assigned to the right trade,
    and synchronized to your existing tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-platform dataset of labeled clash patterns and resolution
    outcomes mapped to trades, zones, and schedules—improving routing and
    prioritization accuracy beyond rule-based competitors. Combined with deep
    integrations (ACC, Revizto, Procore) and sector-specific rule packs, this
    produces faster triage and measurably fewer reopens.

    institutional builds who want fast, confident coordination without clash
    overload.
  problem: >-
    - External: Thousands of noisy Navisworks/Revit clashes, duplicates, false
    positives, unclear ownership, and slow closeout.

    - Internal: Overwhelmed by spreadsheets and meetings; worried critical
    clashes slip through and cause field surprises.

    - Philosophical: Builders should spend time resolving issues—not sifting
    through them.

  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect your models and rulesets. 2) AI triages: dedupes,
    prioritizes by impact/zone/schedule, auto-routes to trades, sets due dates.
    3) Track to done: sync comments, SLA reminders, metrics, and handoff
    reports.

    - Agreement: Secure, read-only access; your data stays in your CDE; no
    lock-in; cancel anytime.
