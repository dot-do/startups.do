  problem:
    - >-
      Manual fact-checking is slow and inconsistent: Reporters and editors spend
      15–45 minutes per article verifying quotes, numbers, dates, names, and
      claims, creating deadline pressure and bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Corrections erode trust and carry hard costs: Corrections/retractions harm
      credibility, drive subscription churn, and can trigger legal exposure;
      many newsrooms lack metrics or audit trails to proactively reduce errors.
    - >-
      Shrinking newsroom resources: Reduced headcount and freelance-heavy
      workflows intensify the need for scalable, standardized verification
      processes without adding headcount.
    - >-
      General-purpose AI tools hallucinate and lack auditability: Current
      writing assistants produce unverifiable content, offer weak citation
      discipline, and are not tailored to newsroom standards and sourcing
      policies.
    - >-
      Fragmented research sources: Reporters search multiple databases and sites
      (government, regulatory, fact-checkers, archives), with inconsistent
      access to paywalled or regional sources.
    - >-
      No structured visibility for editors: Editors lack claim-level visibility,
      confidence scores, and a clear accept/override workflow integrated into
      their CMS, leading to ad-hoc verification and missed risks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated claim extraction and classification: Identify atomic factual
      statements (entities, numerics, quotes, attributions, events) from drafts,
      PDFs, or pasted text; tag claims by type and risk level.
    - >-
      Evidence retrieval with stance analysis: Retrieve high-authority sources
      (government, primary docs, reputable outlets, fact-check databases) and
      classify evidence as corroborating, contradicting, or unrelated with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Citation ranking and reliability scoring: Rank sources by recency,
      authority, and policy alignment (e.g., newsroom whitelist/blacklist),
      showing link, excerpt, date, and reliability score.
    - >-
      Quote and numeric integrity checks: Detect altered quotes, numerical
      inconsistencies (units, magnitudes, currency), and date/place mismatches.
    - >-
      Inline CMS workflow: Side panel inside WordPress VIP, Arc XP,
      TownNews/BLOX, or Naviga showing claim list, status, and one-click insert
      of citations or editor notes; export claim reports for audit/compliance.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: Editors approve/reject suggestions; system
      learns newsroom preferences (e.g., preferred sources) and improves over
      time.
    - >-
      Corrections feedback loop: Track published corrections and updates; map
      back to claims to improve detection and provide newsroom risk analytics.
    - >-
      Multilingual and local-source aware: Support English at launch; roadmap
      for Spanish and French; configurable local/regional source packs.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trail: Immutable claim-check log per article (who
      checked what, when, with which sources) for legal and standards
      compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Publish faster with fewer corrections. Proofline AI extracts check-worthy
    claims from drafts and returns corroborating or contradicting evidence with
    ranked citations and confidence, directly inside your CMS—cutting
    verification time by 30–50% and reducing corrections by 25–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Editorial-grade training data and feedback loops that competitors lack: a
    continuously growing corpus of claim-level editor decisions and
    post-publication corrections tied to CMS audit trails. This produces higher
    precision, newsroom-specific source preferences, and measurable correction
    reductions competitors cannot easily replicate.
