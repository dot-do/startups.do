leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual quoting: Pricing teams spend 2–6 minutes per LTL quote (email
      parsing, class/density checks, tariff lookups, fuel, accessorials) leading
      to backlogs and lost bids.
    - >-
      High error rates: Misapplied tariffs, missed accessorials, incorrect
      density/class and outdated fuel tables cause 2–5% pricing errors, margin
      leakage, and post-shipment rebills.
    - >-
      Inconsistent response to RFPs: Multi-lane bids take days; missed deadlines
      and inconsistent assumptions reduce award rates.
    - >-
      Fragmented portals and formats: Customers submit via email, Excel, and
      procurement portals; logging quotes back into TMS/CRMs is tedious and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: Leaders lack visibility into quote SLA, win rate, price
      competitiveness, and margin by lane, customer, and sales rep.
  solution:
    - >-
      Email/RFP ingestion: Parse emails and spreadsheets; extract
      origin/destination, pieces, dims, weight, NMFC/class, accessorials, dates;
      auto-clarify missing info.
    - >-
      Tariff-accurate rating engine: Compute base, deficit, MC/MIN, FAK,
      CzarLite or carrier base tariffs; apply fuel surcharge, lane-specific
      rules, and accessorial matrices.
    - >-
      Density and class assistance: Auto-calc density, detect class-by-density
      exceptions, flag NMFC risks, suggest reclass options.
    - >-
      Margin and sell-rate logic: Configurable markups by lane, customer,
      service level, and risk; guardrails for minimum margin and exception
      routing to humans.
    - >-
      Portal/RFP automations: Auto-post quotes to shipper procurement portals
      (Ariba/Coupa/Jaggaer) and selected carrier/3PL portals; generate compliant
      RFP responses.
    - >-
      TMS/CRM integrations: APIs/webhooks for MercuryGate, McLeod, Descartes,
      Blue Yonder, Oracle OTM, SAP TM; log quotes and outcomes to CRM
      (Salesforce/HubSpot).
    - >-
      Audit & compliance: Full quote traceability with inputs, rule versions,
      surcharge tables; audit trails for finance and customer disputes.
    - >-
      Learning loop & analytics: Capture outcomes (won/lost, rebills); optimize
      margin rules; dashboards for SLA adherence, win rate, price
      competitiveness, and leakage.
    - >-
      Controls & approvals: Threshold-based human-in-the-loop for sensitive
      customers/lanes; four-eyes approval for margin exceptions.
    - >-
      Security & reliability: SOC 2 program, PII redaction, SSO/SAML; 99.9%
      uptime target and rate-limiting to protect carrier APIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
