  problem:
    - >-
      Duplicate and near-duplicate parts (fasteners, bearings, belts, bushings,
      stamped/cast items) proliferate across product lines, inflating COGS by an
      estimated 3–8% and driving inventory carrying cost and E&O write-offs.
    - >-
      Fragmented supplier base results in weak price leverage and quality
      inconsistency; long-tail vendors often account for 20–40% of SKUs but
      under 10% of spend.
    - >-
      ECN backlogs and limited engineering bandwidth extend consolidation cycle
      times to 4–12 weeks per change, slowing cost-down programs and NPI.
    - >-
      Siloed data across ERP/PLM/CAD lacks shape/spec search; inconsistent,
      non-normalized metadata hampers deduplication and standardization.
    - >-
      Lack of quantified, part-level savings business cases and risk assessments
      hinders cross-functional alignment (Engineering, Sourcing, Quality,
      Finance).
    - >-
      Missed opportunities for volume agreements and alternate sourcing
      (domestic vs. LCC) due to poor visibility to part equivalence and demand
      aggregation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and normalization pipeline connecting to PLM/ERP/CAD (e.g.,
      Teamcenter, Windchill, SAP/Oracle) to unify part master, BOMs, vendor
      master, PO price history, and CAD/STEP files.
    - >-
      AI-driven duplicate detection using shape-based 3D similarity,
      parametric/spec matching (material, finish, grade, tolerance), and NLP on
      descriptions; cluster parts into families and candidates for
      consolidation.
    - >-
      Consolidation proposals: for each cluster, recommend a preferred standard
      (e.g., ASME/ISO fastener spec) and alternates, with commercial impact
      (annual volume, price deltas, MOQ, lead time), inventory disposition plan,
      and risk assessment.
    - >-
      Supplier options: suggest volume aggregation, vendor rationalization,
      dual-sourcing strategies (domestic/LCC/nearshore), and negotiate-ready
      target prices based on should-cost and benchmark analytics.
    - >-
      ECN draft generation: auto-generate redlines, impact analysis (assemblies
      affected, drawings, routings), PPAP/validation needs, sample/test plans,
      and draft stakeholder approvals to accelerate rollout.
    - >-
      Savings tracker and ROI dashboard tying each approved ECN to realized
      COGS, PPV, and inventory reductions; integrates with Finance for
      realization validation.
    - >-
      Governance workflow with Engineering/Sourcing/Quality sign-offs, audit
      logs, and pushback capture; closed-loop updates to PLM/ERP item master and
      preferred part catalogs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn your BOM into cash in 90 days. GreenBOM AI finds
    duplicate/near-duplicate parts, proposes consolidation and supplier options,
    and drafts ECNs with quantified savings, reducing SKUs by 15–35%, supplier
    count by 10–25%, and delivering 2–5% material cost savings with engineering
    effort cut by 60–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned 3D shape/spec matching and consolidation playbooks for lawn and
    garden equipment, with prebuilt standards mappings and supplier benchmarks,
    plus automated ECN drafting and ROI attribution that competitors lack. This
    shortens time-to-value to <90 days and reduces engineering effort by 60–80%
    versus generic MDM or consulting approaches.
