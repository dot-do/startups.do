  problem:
    - >-
      Rice farmers face recurring losses (5–20% in affected seasons) from blast,
      bacterial leaf blight (BLB), and planthoppers due to late detection and
      reactive spraying.
    - >-
      Existing advice is generic or delayed; village-level warnings miss
      microclimate differences that drive disease outbreaks at field scale.
    - >-
      Smallholders lack trustworthy, actionable IPM guidance in local languages;
      over-reliance on pesticides raises costs, resistance, and environmental
      risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weather-driven risk indices for blast, BLB, and planthoppers using 1–5 km
      resolution forecasts, crop stage, and local variety susceptibility.
    - >-
      On-device/edge photo triage: farmer snaps a leaf/plant photo; model
      returns likely issue, confidence, and next best action in <10 seconds.
    - >-
      Actionable IPM playbooks tailored to growth stage and risk level (monitor,
      cultural control, biocontrol, chemical options with FRAC/IRAC rotation and
      PHI).
    - >-
      Hotspot and scouting workflows for FPOs/millers to coordinate
      community-level response and reduce area-wide pressure.
    - >-
      Multilingual support, offline capture with later sync, and communication
      via WhatsApp bot, SMS/IVR for low literacy contexts.
    - >-
      Field logbook and spray tracker to measure cost savings and outcomes and
      qualify for insurer premium discounts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Rice-specific, hyperlocal 3–7-day early warnings plus instant photo
    diagnosis that cut avoidable losses by 5–10% and reduce pesticide sprays by
    20–30%, delivered through low-bandwidth channels farmers already use
    (WhatsApp/SMS) with clear, stage-specific IPM actions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rice-specialized models and thresholds validated with IRRI/NARS partners,
    combined with a uniquely linked dataset (images + micro-weather + phenology
    + farmer outcomes) and B2B2C distribution through millers/FPOs that
    competitors lack. On-device inference enables reliable performance in
    low-connectivity villages, and insurer/lender incentives drive sustained,
    measurable behavior change.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rice growers, co-ops, and advisors who want early warning and fast diagnosis
    to protect yield with fewer inputs and less guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather volatility and fast-moving threats (blast, bacterial
    blight, planthoppers) make timing and identification hard.

    Internal: Constant worry about missing the window or misapplying controls.

    Philosophical: Farmers shouldn’t lose a season because timely, local,
    actionable information wasn’t available.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the cost of late outbreaks and the stress of
    uncertain decisions.

    Authority: Built by agronomists and data scientists; weather-driven risk
    models calibrated for rice; photo AI trained on field-verified cases;
    recommendations aligned with IPM best practices.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Set field location and crop stage. 2) Receive daily risk alerts
    for blast, bacterial blight, and planthoppers. 3) Snap a photo for instant
    triage and confidence score. 4) Follow tailored IPM actions (scouting,
    thresholds, spray timing, rotation guidance) and log actions.

    Agreement: Clear pricing, farmer-owned data, and support via app, SMS, or
