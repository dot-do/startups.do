  problem:
    - >-
      Long-tail, intermittent demand for spare parts causes 15–40% forecast
      error and chronic stockouts on critical parts.
    - >-
      Excess working capital tied up in parts inventory (often 20–35% above
      required levels) due to blanket min/max rules and lack of SLA-aware
      optimization.
    - >-
      SLA penalties and customer downtime when regional depots lack the right
      parts; inconsistent 2-hr/4-hr/NBD response performance across regions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, PLM, FSM, service tickets, IoT) prevents reliable
      installed-base and failure-rate visibility.
    - >-
      Slow phase-in/phase-out management leads to obsolescence and scrapping
      (5–12% annually for certain part classes).
    - >-
      Manual planning in spreadsheets and generic tools does not handle
      multi-echelon networks or SLA-driven service levels.
    - >-
      Unreliable supplier and logistics lead-time variability not factored into
      safety stocks, causing bullwhip effects and backorders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data unification layer that ingests ERP, FSM, PLM/BOM, supplier, and
      logistics data; reconciles part masters, supersessions, and installed-base
      metadata.
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting purpose-built for intermittent/long-tail parts
      (Croston/TSB variants, hierarchical models, reliability/Weibull survival
      analysis, fleet-usage signals).
    - >-
      SLA-aware multi-echelon inventory optimization that sets reorder points,
      safety stock, and min/max by region and response commitment
      (2-hr/4-hr/NBD).
    - >-
      Supplier and logistics risk modeling (lead-time distributions,
      variability, expedites) embedded into safety stock and reorder quantity
      calculations.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if simulations (e.g., SLA tightening, NPI ramp,
      supply disruption, consolidation of FSLs) with P&L and working-capital
      impacts.
    - >-
      Automated phase-in/phase-out and supersession handling to minimize
      obsolescence and dead stock.
    - >-
      Planner copilot with natural-language queries, exception-based workflows,
      and explainable recommendations (feature attributions, demand drivers).
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution connectors to raise POs, update min/max in ERP, and
      publish stocking lists to depots; KPI tracking and governance dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce service parts inventory 15–30% while achieving 97–99% fill rates on
    SLA-critical items, by fusing reliability-driven failure forecasts with SLA-
    and region-aware multi-echelon optimization. Deploy integrations to
    SAP/Oracle/ServiceMax in 60–90 days with auditable decisions and guaranteed
    ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    Aftermarket and service operations leaders at analytical lab instrument
    manufacturers who must meet SLAs globally while controlling spare-parts
    inventory and service costs.
  problem: >-
    Volatile regional demand, long lead times, and unreliable forecasts cause
    stockouts, excess inventory, and SLA risk. Downtime for labs is
    unacceptable.
  guide: >-
    An AI inventory optimizer purpose-built for lab instrument OEMs. We

    science with secure ERP and CMMS integrations to forecast demand and set
    optimal stocks by region and SLA.
  plan: >-
    Connect ERP, field service, and install-base data, then forecast regional
    part demand by SLA and lead time, then set reorder points, safety stock, and
    transfer rules, then monitor and tune monthly. Start with a 6-week pilot and
    clear ROI targets.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct - Book a pilot. Transitional - Request a free spare-parts volatility
    and fill-rate diagnostic.
  success: >-
    Right part, right place, right time. Higher fill rates, fewer expedites, SLA
    compliance, lower carrying costs and obsolescence, happier customers, and
    planners who trust the numbers.
  failure: >-
    Persistent stockouts and overstock, expedited freight, missed SLAs and
    downtime penalties, write-offs, frustrated customers, and burned-out
