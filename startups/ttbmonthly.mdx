leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Monthly TTB reports (e.g., production, storage, and processing/bottling)
      are time-consuming (often 8–30 hours/month per DSP) and error-prone due to
      manual consolidation of logs, gauge readings, proofs, and movements.
    - >-
      Data lives in multiple silos (spreadsheets, tank logs, weighing/gauging
      sheets, warehouse logs, bottling records, shipping docs, LIMS, and ERP),
      creating reconciliation headaches and version control risk.
    - >-
      Small mistakes (e.g., unbalanced gains/losses, proof/temperature
      conversion errors, mislabeled DSP location, missing source docs) can
      trigger notices of error, re-filings, audits, or delayed COLA/formula
      actions.
    - >-
      Existing tools often require manual data entry and don’t systematically
      cross-check production, storage, and processing ledgers, leaving
      compliance owners to do the heavy lifting.
    - >-
      Audits are stressful and expensive because there’s no clear, immutable
      audit trail linking each report line item back to source transactions and
      approvals.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingestion of production, storage, and bottling/processing records from
      spreadsheets, PDFs, ERPs, and sensors; normalizes to a compliant ledger.
    - >-
      Automated reconciliation across modules (production ↔ storage ↔
      processing/bottling) with tolerance checks for gains/losses, proof
      conversions, and movement balances.
    - >-
      Generation of ready-to-file monthly reports (e.g., TTB forms for
      Production, Storage, and Processing operations) with line-by-line source
      links and change logs.
    - >-
      Discrepancy detection and guided remediation workflow that assigns tasks,
      tracks resolution, and documents corrective actions.
    - >-
      Audit pack creation: immutable export of reports, source documents,
      approvals, and system logs for auditors or internal QA.
    - >-
      Role-based approvals and period close controls to lock filings and support
      separation of duties.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
