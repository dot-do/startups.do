leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Prime yield losses (0.5–3.0 pp) from intermittent defects (stones,
      bubbles, scratches, ream, pinholes, streaks, arcing/particle defects on
      coated glass) that are hard to tie back to process conditions.
    - >-
      Long time-to-root-cause (hours to weeks) due to siloed data: vision
      systems, furnace/tin bath/lehr PLCs, coater PLCs, vacuum systems,
      historians (PI/Ignition), and lab QA are not correlated.
    - >-
      Recipe/coater drift and equipment health issues (target wear, pump
      degradation, gas flow instability) cause recurring defect excursions
      without early warning.
    - >-
      Limited expert bandwidth on night/weekend shifts; corrective actions are
      inconsistent and knowledge isn’t captured systematically.
    - >-
      Existing vision OEM tools detect defects but don’t explain why they
      occurred or what to adjust in the float line or coater.
    - >-
      Small process changes (line speed, bath temperature gradients, chamber
      pressure differential) have nonlinear impacts; manual analytics are slow
      and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data fabric for glass: prebuilt connectors for
      ISRA/Viprotron/LiteSentry vision, PLC/DCS (Rockwell, Siemens), coaters
      (Von Ardenne/other OEMs), vacuum/thermal sensors, and historians (OSIsoft
      PI, Ignition, AVEVA).
    - >-
      Defect-to-process correlation engine: time-synchronizes defect events with
      process signals, spatially maps sheet position to coater chambers/targets,
      and aligns with furnace/tin bath/lehr zones.
    - >-
      Causal inference and rules hybrid: physics-informed ML plus causal
      discovery to rank likely root causes (e.g., target current ripple →
      pinholes; tin bath top roll vibration → scratches; chamber pressure
      oscillation → streaks).
    - >-
      Action recommendation playbooks: step-by-step corrective actions per
      defect class (e.g., adjust target power setpoint ±x%, check gas MFC
      calibration, inspect shield, stabilize bath temp gradient) with expected
      impact and risk.
    - >-
      Early-warning alerts: anomaly detection provides 5–15 minutes lead time
      before defect rates breach spec; escalation includes recommended checks
      and verification steps.
    - >-
      Closed-loop readiness: optional API to send setpoint suggestions to
      control systems under MOC/approval workflows; A/B trial management for
      safe recipe experiments.
    - >-
      Operator and manager views: shift dashboards (defect ppm, prime yield,
      active root-cause hypotheses), coater health index, and daily/weekly RCA
      reports with evidence trails.
    - >-
      Knowledge capture: auto-logs of actions taken, results, and confirmation;
      builds a site-specific knowledge base that improves recommendations over
      time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase prime yield by 0.3–1.0 percentage points within 90 days by
    automatically correlating vision defects with float and coater process
    signals to identify likely root causes and recommend operator-ready
    corrective actions—without replacing existing inspection or control systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary cross-plant defect–process knowledge graph and
    physics-informed models specifically for float lines and magnetron sputter
    coaters, plus OEM-certified connectors that deliver faster time-to-value and
    higher RCA accuracy than generic analytics or single-vendor vision tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, process and quality engineers on float and coater lines who
    want predictable yield, on‑spec glass, and calm, no‑firefighting shifts.
  problem: >-
    Defects show up on vision systems, but true root causes hide across
    thousands of signals (tin bath, furnace zones, draw speed, coater
    pressures/flows). Teams lose hours chasing noise, scrap and rework climb,
    shipments risk delay, and tribal know‑how stays siloed.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of yield loss and customer claims. Yield & Defect
    Investigator—built by flat‑glass process and ML experts—fuses vision defects
    with time‑synced process data to pinpoint likely causes and prescribe
    corrective actions, turning every incident into line learning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: integrate with vision + SCADA/MES historians and map your defect
    taxonomy/process flow. 2) Calibrate: backtest on historical events, validate
    hypotheses with engineers, set alert thresholds. 3) Run & improve: go live
    with ranked RCAs and action playbooks; close the loop with operator feedback
    to continuously learn.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 45‑minute demo and data‑readiness check to scope a 30‑day on‑line
    pilot.
  success: >-
    Higher first‑pass yield, faster RCAs (minutes not days), fewer breakouts and
    coating defects, stabilized recipes, confident audits, and on‑time
    shipments—without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning cash on scrap and rework, chasing ghosts across signals,
    missing shipments, and exhausting operators while competitors lock in
    quality and cost advantages.
