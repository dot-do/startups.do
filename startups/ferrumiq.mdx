leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Spec misses (mechanical properties out-of-tolerance) cause downgrades,
      rework, and scrap, typically 1–5% of tonnage in long-product mills,
      costing $10–40 per ton on affected lots.
    - >-
      Over-conservative recipes (excess alloying, higher energy, slower speeds)
      used to avoid misses increase cost by 1–3% per ton and constrain
      throughput.
    - >-
      Trial-and-error and manual DOE to introduce or transition grades leads to
      long cycle times (4–12 weeks) and risk to customer OTIF; engineering time
      is constrained.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across Level 1, Level 2/3 MES/LIMS, historians, and labs
      prevents end-to-end prediction and closed-loop control.
    - >-
      Lack of uncertainty awareness in current models/tools forces wide guard
      bands and over-sampling; unquantified risk increases QA burden and
      customer complaints.
    - >-
      Operator variability and shift-to-shift inconsistency lead to recipe drift
      and process instability.
    - >-
      Existing solutions are either physics-only (limited to composition/steady
      state) or generic ML that fails under domain shifts (e.g., new steel
      grades, new roll pass, seasonal cooling).
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration and governance across L1/L2/3, MES, LIMS, and historians
      (e.g., OSIsoft PI) to create per-heat and per-bundle digital records.
    - >-
      Hybrid physics-ML models predicting key mechanical properties (YS/UTS/El,
      hardness, toughness) from composition, thermal history, deformation
      schedule, and cooling, with uncertainty estimation.
    - >-
      Recipe Advisor that suggests setpoint windows for furnace temps/soaks,
      rolling speeds/pass reductions, controlled cooling/water flow,
      coiling/bundle temps—optimized for hitting spec with cost/energy
      constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time risk scoring for each heat/bundle (probability of miss vs
      tolerance), with alerts and dynamic guard bands; sampling frequency
      optimization to maintain quality while reducing test load.
    - >-
      Grade transfer learning to adapt models quickly to new grades/lines with
      minimal labeled data, and what-if scenario planning for new recipes.
    - >-
      Operator UI and APIs for L2/PLC to enable advisory or closed-loop modes;
      audit trails to support certification and customer documentation.
    - >-
      Continuous model monitoring (MAE, calibration, drift), periodic
      recalibration, and A/B testing to validate ROI and maintain model health.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Meet mechanical specs with margin while lowering alloy and energy cost.
