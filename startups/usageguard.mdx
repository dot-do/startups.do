  problem:
    - >-
      Revenue leakage of 0.5–2.0% of billed revenue due to mismatches between
      network usage (CDR/UDR), rating, and invoicing—often undetected for
      months.
    - >-
      Fragmented OSS/BSS stacks (switch logs, mediation, rating, billing,
      invoicing, taxation) lack end-to-end lineage, causing blind spots and high
      manual reconciliation effort (5–20 FTEs in mid/large carriers).
    - >-
      Legacy, rules-only controls miss novel leakage patterns (new plan
      launches, promotions, migrations to fiber/VoIP/UCaaS) and degrade over
      time; high false positives overwhelm teams.
    - >-
      Slow detection (monthly/quarterly) increases write-offs, disputes, and
      customer churn; revenue at risk accumulates between bill runs.
    - >-
      Regulatory and audit pressure (CPNI, SOX, SOC, state PUCs) requires
      traceable, explainable reconciliations; current spreadsheets/scripts are
      not audit-ready.
    - >-
      Complex interconnect/wholesale and enterprise services (SIP trunks,
      Ethernet, IP transit) produce high-volume, heterogeneous records that are
      hard to normalize and match.
    - >-
      Billing transformations (Amdocs/CSG/Netcracker/Oracle BRM migrations)
      frequently introduce leakage; carriers lack a safe “rating re-simulation”
      test harness before cutover.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from switches (SIP/SS7/AMA/EMI), mediation (e.g.,
      DigitalRoute, Openet), rating (Amdocs/CSG/Oracle BRM/Netcracker),
      billing/invoice/GL, and tax engines (Avalara/SureTax)—batch and streaming.
    - >-
      Deterministic and probabilistic matching engine: schema harmonization,
      fuzzy joins, tolerance windows, sequence validation, and duplicate/split
      detection with per-record lineage.
    - >-
      Rating re-simulation: re-rate usage against current/tariff catalogs to
      detect rating defects, plan misconfigurations, discount leakage, and
      taxation anomalies.
    - >-
      Invoice conformance: verify that rated items, taxes/fees/surcharges,
      proration, and credits align with invoice lines; reconcile to GL to ensure
      revenue completeness.
    - >-
      AI anomaly detection: unsupervised models (isolation forest/autoencoders)
      and supervised classifiers on historical leak patterns; drift monitoring
      and explainability for audits.
    - >-
      Exception management workflows: severity scoring, ownership, SLAs,
      auto-remediation playbooks, and bi-directional ticketing
      (ServiceNow/Jira).
    - >-
      Partner/interconnect reconciliation: compare interconnect CDRs and
      settlements; detect disputes, cascade rating errors, and reconcile off-net
      charges.
    - >-
      Change impact sandbox: pre-production what-if tests for new plans,
      mediation/rating changes, and migrations; can run against production-like
      data.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II, role-based access, PII
      tokenization, on-prem/VPC or hybrid deployment, full audit trails.
    - >-
      Dashboards and KPIs: leakage by product/region/partner, time-to-detect,
      match rates, and financial impact; executive and analyst views.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut usage-to-billing leakage by 20–50 bps within 90 days through end-to-end,
    explainable AI reconciliation of CDR/UDR→mediation→rating→invoice—99.9%
    deterministic match rates, <2% false positives, and auditable lineage on
    every record.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Wired-specific reconciliation IP: a large, curated library of controls and
    connectors to Metaswitch/Ribbon/BroadWorks, IPDR/DOCSIS, and enterprise SIP
    workflows; explainable AI with per-record lineage; and a pilot model that
    ties fees to recovered leakage, accelerating stakeholder buy-in. Anonymized
    benchmark data across carriers improves detection out-of-the-box.
