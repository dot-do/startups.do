  problem:
    - >-
      Low first-time-fix rate (FTFR) for pump diagnostics (typical baseline
      60–70%) leads to repeat truck rolls and SLA penalties.
    - >-
      Technician knowledge is uneven and retiring experts take tribal knowledge
      with them; training new hires to autonomy can take 6–12 months.
    - >-
      Manual report writing (30–60 minutes per visit) causes backlogs, poor
      documentation quality, and billing delays.
    - >-
      Incorrect parts identification leads to 10–25% parts misorders, increasing
      downtime and return logistics costs.
    - >-
      Limited access to up-to-date manuals, engineering bulletins, and prior
      cases in the field; offline environments hamper troubleshooting.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance steps are inconsistently followed and documented,
      creating risk exposure for OEMs and service providers.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (FSM, CMMS, PLM, parts catalogs) force technicians to
      switch contexts and re-enter data.
    - >-
      Language barriers and multi-brand installed bases make consistent
      diagnostics across regions difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-guided troubleshooting flows mapped to specific pump families and
      failure modes, adaptive to observed symptoms and telemetry (if available).
    - >-
      On-device and cloud image/video analysis to recognize pump model/serial
      plates, wear patterns (seal leakage, diaphragm cracks, cavitation damage),
      and installation nonconformities.
    - >-
      Instant access to curated manuals, service bulletins, torque specs,
      exploded views, and prior resolved cases; updates sync when online.
    - >-
      Automatic visit documentation: timestamps, steps taken, test readings,
      photos, compliance checklists, and annotated parts lists; one-click export
      to FSM/CMMS.
    - >-
      Parts identification and BOM suggestions linked to OEM/distributor
      catalogs with availability, supersessions, and pricing; optional cart
      creation.
    - >-
      Multilingual voice and chat interface with domain glossary; offline mode
      with smart sync for remote sites.
    - >-
      Embedded safety workflows (LOTO, chemical handling, PPE) and digital
      sign-offs for audits.
    - >-
      Admin console with analytics on FTFR, MTTR, misorders, training gaps, and
      model performance; feedback loops to continuously improve guidance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pump-specialized AI copilot that guides technicians through accurate,
    step-by-step diagnostics (text/voice/vision), auto-generates compliant
    service reports and parts lists, and integrates with your FSM/CMMS to raise
    first-time fix rates, cut resolution time, and increase parts
    accuracy—online or offline.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, pump-specific knowledge graph and vision dataset
    built from OEM-sourced manuals, verified field cases, and annotated defect
    imagery—combined with deep FSM/EAM and parts catalog integrations. This
    domain depth enables higher diagnostic precision and parts accuracy than
    generic copilots, and offline-first mobile delivery ensures reliability at
    remote sites. OEM co-development and data-sharing agreements create
    defensible data network effects.

  character: >-
    Field service technicians and service managers at measuring, dispensing, and
    other pumping equipment manufacturers and service providers who must restore
    uptime fast and document every visit.
  problem: >-
    Equipment variants are complex, manuals and case history are scattered, and
    experts aren’t always available—leading to slow diagnostics, wrong parts,
    repeat truck rolls, SLA pressure, and unhappy customers.
  guide: >-
    Field Service Troubleshooting Copilot understands frontline constraints and
    brings OEM-level confidence—combining manuals, prior cases, and live
    image/video analysis into clear, safe, step-by-step guidance with full
    traceability.
  plan: >-
    1) Pilot: ingest your manuals and sample cases; 2) Onsite: capture
    photos/video and symptoms; Copilot suggests likely faults, tests, and parts;
    3) Closeout: approve auto-generated visit report and parts list; 4) Scale:
    integrate with CMMS/ERP and refine via feedback.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30-minute demo and start a 30-day pilot. Transitional:
    download a sample troubleshooting flow and visit report.
  success: >-
    Faster, more accurate diagnostics; higher first-time-fix; correct parts on
    hand; standardized reports; captured institutional knowledge; reduced MTTR
    and callbacks; clearer communication and uptime for customers.
  failure: >-
    Without it, knowledge remains tribal, diagnosis takes longer, parts are
    mis-ordered, repeat visits rise, warranties leak value, safety risks
    increase, and customer trust erodes.
