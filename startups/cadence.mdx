  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers experience 15–30% annual stockouts on fast-moving consumables
      (strings, reeds, drumsticks) during peak school/holiday cycles, leading to
      missed sales and poor customer loyalty.
    - >-
      Overstock on slow-moving SKUs ties up 10–25% of working capital; GMROI
      suffers due to dead stock and inaccurate min/max settings.
    - >-
      Manual reordering is error-prone and time-consuming (5–15
      hours/week/store); most POS systems lack demand forecasting and rely on
      static reorder points.
    - >-
      Lead times are volatile (imported instruments 8–16+ weeks; consumables 1–6
      weeks) and vary by vendor, causing misaligned purchase orders.
    - >-
      Local seasonality (school calendars, marching band season, holiday
      gifting) is not captured in generic tools, causing forecast bias and
      mistimed buys.
    - >-
      Poor data hygiene (duplicate SKUs, missing vendor part numbers, pack
      sizes, UOM) impairs ordering accuracy and supplier matching.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack (POS/ecommerce/ERP) requires manual exports; no
      unified view of multi-location inventory and transfers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest POS/ecommerce/ERP sales, inventory, vendor catalogs, and lead-time
      data via native integrations.
    - >-
      Apply SKU-level forecasting (hierarchical by category/brand/location) with
      seasonality signals (school calendars, holidays, events) and lead-time
      learning.
    - >-
      Set dynamic reorder points and safety stock by service-level targets
      (e.g., 97%) and variability; compute EOQ with MOQs/price breaks.
    - >-
      Auto-generate purchase orders by vendor with ETA projections; route for
      one-click approval; submit via EDI/email/portal.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards for forecast accuracy (MAPE/WMAPE), stockout risk,
      turns, GMROI, dead stock, and open-to-buy.
    - >-
      Continuous data hygiene: SKU/vendor mapping, pack-size normalization,
      duplicate detection.
    - >-
      Multi-location optimization: suggest transfers before buying; prioritize
      highest-ROI replenishment.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts and excess inventory with music-retail–specific AI that
    learns your school calendars, vendor lead times, and seasonality to

  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized forecasting that embeds school calendars, MI-specific

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Owners and inventory managers at musical instrument and supplies retailers
    who want the right stock at the right time without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: unpredictable demand across instruments and consumables, long
    supplier lead times, and school/holiday spikes. Internal: constant
    firefighting with spreadsheets, missed sales, and cash trapped in dead
    stock. Philosophical: retailers shouldn’t lose customers or capital because
    forecasting is hard.
  guide: >-
    We understand how variant-heavy catalogs, low-velocity SKUs, and academic
    calendars make planning painful. Built by retail ops and data science
    practitioners for specialty retail, our AI models seasonality, promotions,
    and lead times to recommend precise reorder points and buys.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect POS/ERP, e‑commerce, and supplier data; 2) Calibrate
    forecasts, safety stock, and reorder points by SKU/location with
    school/holiday seasonality; 3) Auto-draft POs aligned to lead times for
    approval or auto-send, with continuous monitoring. Agreement: clear ROI
    goals, human-in-the-loop controls, easy install, cancel anytime, your data
    stays yours.

    Direct: schedule a 20‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot on one category.
    Transitional: get a free inventory health report and sample forecast for
    your top 100 SKUs.
  success: >-
    Right product, right quantity, right time; fewer stockouts; lower carrying
    costs; higher turns; hours saved each week; confident buys ahead of band
    season and holidays; happier customers who find what they need.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing stockouts, rush shipping, and lost sales; piles of dead stock tying
    up cash; manual spreadsheet churn; missed moments like back‑to‑school and
    holiday concerts.
