  problem:
    - >-
      Margin erosion from inconsistent discounting and ad‑hoc pricing by
      reps/brokers, especially on long-tail SKUs and small deals
    - >-
      Complex cost stack (base cost, freight, rebates, payment terms, FX) makes
      it hard to set floor prices in real time
    - >-
      Slow quote turnaround (hours to days) due to manual spreadsheet pricing,
      lookups, and approvals
    - >-
      Price drift across territories and reps leads to channel conflict and
      customer mistrust
    - >-
      No reliable way to predict win probability vs. price; fear of losing the
      deal pushes reps to underprice
    - >-
      Hidden leakage from misapplied rebates/freight surcharges and outdated
      cost files
    - >-
      Limited analytics on deal outcomes; leaders can’t measure margin lift or
      enforce guardrails
    - >-
      Legacy CPQ/ERP tools lack AI guidance; implementation is heavy and
      adoption is low for brokers/agents
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven guidance for every quote: recommended target price,
      floors/ceilings, and expected win probability curve by
      product-customer-deal context
    - >-
      Guardrails that account for base cost, freight, rebates, and payment
      terms, with automated approval routing if reps attempt to go below floor
    - >-
      Outcome-aware models trained on historical wins/losses, seasonality,
      competitor pressure, and price elasticity by segment
    - >-
      Real-time calculators for rebates, freight, and fees with explainability
      (line-by-line cost-to-serve view)
    - >-
      Scenario and negotiation mode: simulate concession paths, bundle/volume
      incentives, and their impact on margin and win likelihood
    - >-
      Lightweight plugins for Outlook/Gmail, Excel, and CRM/CPQ so reps can
      quote without switching tools
    - >-
      Analytics: margin leakage detection, price variance across
      reps/territories, mix-adjusted margin lift, and guardrail adherence
    - >-
      Fast deployment: prebuilt connectors for common ERP/CRM/TMS/rebate tools;
      clean-room or SFTP data onboarding
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Deal-specific price recommendations and enforceable guardrails that lift
    margin 120–300 bps without hurting win rates—embedded in the broker/rep
    workflow and live in 30 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Broker- and rebate-aware pricing models with explainable guardrails embedded
    directly in rep tools (email/Excel/CRM), combined with a growing anonymized
    outcomes dataset that improves elasticity estimates and floors
    rapidly—delivering measurable bps lift in weeks, not quarters.

    profitability.
