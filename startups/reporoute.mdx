leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inefficient nightly patrol/visit routes lead to 10–25% wasted miles and
      time per shift.
    - >-
      Live intelligence (ALPR hits, payment status changes, new addresses,
      shift-work patterns) is not ingested into routes in real time, causing
      missed recoveries.
    - >-
      Dispatching is manual and static (e.g., spreadsheets/Clearplan boards),
      creating overload and slow reaction to events after dark.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance risks (no-contact hours, trespass, confrontation)
      are hard to manage consistently in the field.
    - >-
      Proof-of-presence, chain-of-custody, and evidence capture are
      inconsistent, increasing dispute risk with lenders and forwarders.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across RDN/MBSi, DRN/MVTRAC, skip-trace tools, and internal
      notes; lack of a unified operational picture.
    - >-
      Fuel and overtime costs are rising; agencies struggle to measure ROI of
      patrols and agent productivity.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI route optimizer that re-plans every 2–5 minutes using live signals
      (ALPR hits, lender status changes, traffic, curfew windows) with <10s
      compute-to-device latency.
    - >-
      Probabilistic location/time-of-day scoring per asset using historical
      attempts, neighborhood patterns, and shift-work heuristics to prioritize
      visits.
    - >-
      Field Copilot mobile app (iOS/Android) with offline maps, voice-first
      prompts, glove-friendly UI, and evidence capture flow (photos, VIN,
      condition).
    - >-
      Dispatch console for scenario simulation, team load balancing, and
      automated job assignment from RDN/MBSi queues; includes hot-zone and no-go
      geofences.
    - >-
      Compliance and safety guardrails (no-contact hours, property rules,
      de-escalation tips, incident logging) embedded into routing constraints.
    - >-
      One-click case sync and proof package back to RDN/MBSi (timestamps, GPS
      trails, media) for lender/forwarder audit.
    - >-
      Open API/Webhooks for telemetry/dashcam/SaaS integrations; SSO, role-based
      access, and audit logging.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase nightly recoveries by 15–30% per agent and reduce miles per
    recovery by 10–20% with an AI copilot that dynamically re-optimizes routes
    from live intel, enforces compliance, and integrates with RDN/MBSi and ALPR
    networks—without forcing a rip-and-replace of existing tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset across multiple agencies/forwarders + ALPR networks
    enabling superior time-of-day/location predictions; voice-first offline
    copilot purpose-built for night repossession workflows; compliance-by-design
    routing and audit trails lenders can trust; early integration and referral
    agreements that create distribution advantages and switching costs.
  customerSegments:

      leaders needing standardization and dashboards.
    - >-
      Lender in-house recovery units — supervisors needing controlled routing
      and audit trails.
    - >-
      Skip-trace teams — analysts who want predicted location/time windows to
      hand off to field teams.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to agencies via outbound/inside sales; ROI calculator-led
      demos focused on nightly operations.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Repo operations managers and field leads who need to maximize nightly
    recoveries, keep agents safe, and hit client SLAs.
  problem: >-
    Night crews chase stale leads on inefficient routes; intel shifts by the
    minute, fuel and overtime climb, windows are missed, and recoveries slip.
  guide: >-
    Route Optimization & Field Ops Copilot understands repossession chaos; our
    AI fuses LPR hits, skip-trace notes, time windows, traffic, and agent
    constraints, then adapts routes in real time.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect territories, crews, and data sources; 2) Launch nightly optimized
    routes with a live copilot app that updates on fresh intel; 3) Review
    results in audit-ready dashboards and scale to more trucks.
  callToAction: Schedule a 20-minute demo or start a 14-day field trial on two trucks.
  success: >-
    Increase nightly recoveries while driving fewer miles and logging less
    overtime; safer, compliant operations; faster first-time touches;
    audit-ready logs; happier clients and faster paid invoices.
  failure: >-
    Keep wasting nights on bad routes, miss recoveries and SLAs, burn cash on
    fuel and overtime, risk unsafe encounters, and erode client trust.
