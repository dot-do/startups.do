  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering Change Notices (ECNs) and design notes are not directly
      consumable by dealers; tech pubs teams spend 25–40 hours per bulletin
      converting raw engineering content into procedures, diagrams, and parts
      lists.
    - >-
      Bulletins lack serial-number and configuration targeting, leading to
      irrelevant communications, lower dealer engagement, and missed fixes.
    - >-
      Distribution is fragmented (email, portals, PDFs); manufacturers lack
      verifiable read/acknowledge and technician competency tracking, creating
      audit and safety risks.
    - >-
      Slow release cycles: ECN approval to dealer bulletin often takes 2–6
      weeks, delaying field fixes and increasing warranty costs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent procedures and torque/spec errors cause rework and repeat
      repairs; first-time fix rates are below 80% at many dealers.
    - >-
      Translations for multilingual dealer networks add 3–10 days and introduce
      inconsistency with controlled terminology.
    - >-
      Metrics are limited; manufacturers struggle to link bulletins to warranty
      claim reduction, kit consumption, and field reliability improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Connectors pull ECNs, CAD illustrations, BOMs, and engineering
      notes from PLM/ERP (PTC Windchill/Arbortext, Siemens Teamcenter, Dassault
      3DEXPERIENCE, SAP/Oracle).
    - >-
      Normalize: Extract serial ranges, affected configurations, torque specs,
      hazard statements; map to a domain ontology (ANSI Z535, ISO symbols, OEM
      terminology).
    - >-
      Generate: AI produces dealer-ready bulletins—procedures, safety callouts,
      tools/parts kits, labor times, decision trees—with controlled language and
      consistent style.
    - >-
      Illustrate: Auto-generate/derive labeled illustrations/exploded views from
      CAD to SVG/PNG; highlight affected components and fasteners.
    - >-
      Review/Approve: Human-in-the-loop workflow with redlines, change tracking,
      and e-signatures; policy checks for safety, compliance, and brand voice.
    - >-
      Distribute: Target by dealer, territory, model configuration, and serial
      number; push to dealer portals, email, DMS, and mobile; schedule staged
      rollouts.
    - >-
      Track: Read receipts, knowledge checks, and technician attestations;
      measure kit orders and field completion rates; audit trail per bulletin
      and dealer.
    - >-
      Measure ROI: Link bulletins to warranty claim codes, labor hours, and
      parts consumption; report cost avoidance, MTTR reduction, and first-time
      fix improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From ECN to dealer-ready, targeted service bulletin in under 48 hours—with
    verified dealer acknowledgements, integrated parts kits, and measurable
    impact on warranty costs and first-time fix rates.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned generation and compliance engine for OPE that unifies ECN
    inputs, CAD visuals, BOM diffs, safety standards, and dealer distribution
    with serial-range targeting—plus feedback loops that tie bulletins to
    warranty outcomes and kit consumption. Over time, the proprietary corpus of
    validated procedures, torque/spec libraries, and dealer performance data
    compounds accuracy and speed in ways generic AI and generic PLM modules
    cannot easily replicate.
