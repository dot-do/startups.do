  problem:
    - >-
      Plants lose 1–5% yield from suboptimal rip/crosscut/resaw patterns due to
      manual planning in Excel or rules-of-thumb, translating to
      $50,000–$500,000 waste per $10M of lumber spend.
    - >-
      Planners spend 2–6 hours/day consolidating orders, inventory, and
      constraints; plan turnaround delays limit throughput and on-time delivery.
    - >-
      Frequent mislabels and incomplete packs (0.5–2.0% of pieces) create
      rework, customer chargebacks, and schedule disruption.
    - >-
      Machine constraints (kerf, min/max lengths, arbor setups, fence widths,
      gripper clearance) are not consistently encoded in plans, causing jams,
      unsafe cuts, and downtime (15–45 min changeovers).
    - >-
      Order variability and mixed species/grades complicate rip-first vs.
      crosscut-first decisions; many plants default to one approach and leave
      1–2% yield on the table.
    - >-
      Resaw and planing allowances (thickness recovery, cupping,
      moisture-related movement) aren’t modeled precisely, creating off-spec
      parts and waste.
    - >-
      Skill scarcity: senior planners retiring; new hires need 6–12 months to
      reach proficiency; tribal knowledge isn’t systematized.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated feedback loop: realized yields and defects aren’t fed
      back into planning; no continuous learning to improve patterns by
      species/mill/machine.
    - >-
      Siloed systems: ERP/MES, inventory, and scanners don’t talk; no single
      source of truth for board footage, grade pulls, and work-in-process.
    - >-
      No clear ROI visibility; CFOs want quantified savings linked to yield and
      labor time, but current tools don’t produce trustworthy reports.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse orders (PDF, CSV, email, EDI) and live inventory to auto-generate
      rip-first or crosscut-first sequences with machine-aware constraints.
    - >-
      Hybrid optimizer (mixed-integer programming + heuristics + learned
      patterns) targeting multi-objective goals: yield, throughput, changeovers,
      due dates.
    - >-
      Resaw and planing-aware thickness modeling with configurable allowances by
      species/grade/moisture and target finish.
    - >-
      Automatic label generation (barcodes/QR, human-readable) and pack sheets
      aligned to customer and NHLA rules.
    - >-
      Sequencing and staging plans for cells (ripsaw -> chop -> resaw -> planer)
      with WIP balancing and minimal tool changes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop feedback: ingest realized cut data and scanner/scale outputs
      to retrain patterns and adjust allowances.
    - >-
      Dashboards and yield reports (by order, species, grade, saw, shift) with
      CFO-ready ROI summaries.
    - >-
      Native connectors to ERP/MES (e.g., DMSi Agility, Epicor LumberTrack,
      NetSuite), scanners (Microtec/USNR), printers (Zebra), and handhelds.
    - >-
      Edge deployment option for shop-floor resilient operation; cloud analytics
      for fleet benchmarking.
    - >-
      Safety/compliance checks: enforce machine envelopes, minimum offcut
      lengths, and anti-kickback rules.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven cut planning that turns orders and on-hand inventory into
    machine-ready rip/crosscut/resaw plans, labels, and yield reports in
    minutes—boosting yield by 1–3%, cutting planning time 50–80%, and reducing
    mislabels and changeovers, with closed-loop learning from actual production.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning tied to realized yields and machine telemetry across
    multiple plants, plus a library of validated machine profiles and
    species/grade recovery tables. The hybrid optimization engine blends MILP
    with domain-specific heuristics and learned patterns, enabling faster,
    better plans than OEM-tied or rules-only tools. Deep ERP/MES and OEM
    integrations reduce switching costs and time-to-value.

  character: >-
    Operations managers and sawroom leads at cut-stock, resaw, and planing shops
    who want reliable schedules, maximum yield, and simple, executable cut
    plans.
  problem: >-
    Manual spreadsheets and tribal knowledge create inconsistent yields,
    miscuts, rework, and overtime; orders and inventory don’t translate into
    clear rip/crosscut/resaw plans or labels—causing waste and missed ship
    dates.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill-floor chaos and have built AI with wood-products
    expertise to turn orders and inventory into optimized saw plans, labels, and
    yield reports—proven to cut waste and boost throughput.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders and inventory (CSV/API). 2) Run the optimizer to generate
    rip/crosscut/resaw plans, labels, and machine queues. 3) Print labels,
    execute cuts, and review yield reports for continuous improvement.
  callToAction: Start a 14-day pilot with your real orders or book a 30-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Consistent high yield and margins, fewer miscuts, faster throughput,
    accurate labels and traceability, on-time shipments, and confident,
    data-driven planning.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing scrap and overbuying, rework and downtime, shop-floor confusion, and
    missed ship dates from ad-hoc cut planning.
