  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs and modernization units must meet tightening energy performance
      requirements (e.g., ISO 25745 labeling, EPBD in EU) but lack standardized,
      scalable baselining across diverse controllers and drives.
    - >-
      Default drive and controller parameters are conservative; regen modules
      are often misconfigured or disabled, leaving 10–35% energy savings
      unrealized.
    - >-
      Standby consumption (lighting, fans, controllers) is frequently 100–250W
      per car/escalator due to poor sleep/timeout policies and legacy
      components.
    - >-
      Dispatch/scheduling strategies do not adapt to actual traffic patterns,
      wasting energy via unnecessary moves, poor parking strategies, and
      suboptimal group control settings.
    - >-
      Manufacturers can’t quantify energy performance improvements at product or
      fleet level to support sales, rebates, and sustainability reporting.
    - >-
      Retrofit/modernization programs lack a repeatable M&V process to prove
      savings to customers and utilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated baselining engine aligned to ISO 25745-1, -2 (lifts), and -3
      (escalators/moving walks), using edge metering plus controller/drive
      telemetry to produce standardized energy profiles and classes (A–D).
    - >-
      Optimization recommendations and safe parameter tuning: drive V/f or
      vector control tuning, regen enable thresholds, braking chopper setpoints,
      standby/sleep policies (lighting, fan, controller), door dwell and speed
      profiles, group parking and off-peak scheduling—within OEM-approved safety
      envelopes.
    - >-
      Traffic-aware scheduling: model real call logs to create daily/weekly
      traffic profiles; recommend parking floors, reduced speed/accel in
      off-peak, escalator slow/stop policies with presence detection.
    - >-
      A/B testing and M&V: metered before/after baselines, IPMVP Option C-style
      reporting with uncertainty bounds; automated utility rebate documentation;
      ISO 25745 class improvement tracking.
    - >-
      Deployment-friendly integration: edge gateway with BACnet/IP, Modbus
      TCP/RTU, CANopen-Lift, OPC UA, and REST; parameter libraries mapped to
      major controller/drive families; change control with rollback.
    - >-
      Fleet analytics for OEMs: portfolio view by model, region, branch;
      attach-rate dashboards for modernization kits; product feedback loop to
      engineering.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  character: >-
    Elevator and moving stairway manufacturers (product, R&D, compliance, and
    bid teams) who want provable ISO 25745 energy performance and competitive
    tenders through smarter settings and scheduling.
  problem: >-
    - External: Rising energy demands, complex drive/regeneration options,
    inconsistent field usage; hard to evidence ISO 25745 performance across
    variants.

    controllers and traffic logs.

    - Philosophical: Vertical transport should be efficient, not waste energy at
    idle or off‑peak.

    - Villain: Guesswork in parameters and schedules that leads to avoidable
    kWh, heat, and cost.
