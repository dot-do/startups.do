leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned recycle/anti-surge events and suboptimal setpoints waste fuel
      gas (1–5% efficiency loss per unit) and increase CO2e.
    - >-
      Episodic methane venting (blowdowns, seal vents, VRU upsets) and fugitive
      leaks go undetected for weeks, triggering regulatory risk and methane
      fees.
    - >-
      Lack of unified view: operations optimize throughput and reliability;
      ESG/compliance teams need quantifiable, auditable emissions data; systems
      are siloed.
    - >-
      Existing controls (OEM/PLC) protect equipment but rarely recommend
      economic setpoints across changing field conditions (gas composition,
      suction pressure, ambient).
    - >-
      Manual LDAR/periodic surveys miss intermittent emissions; continuous
      monitoring hardware is costly to deploy at scale.
    - >-
      Operators lack standardized, measurement-informed inventories (OGMP 2.0
      Level 4/5) and near-real-time Subpart W estimates tied to operating
      states.
  solution:
    - >-
      Software-only AI layer ingesting historian/SCADA (e.g., PI, Ignition) and
      controller tags (CCC, Woodward) to build a live digital twin of each
      compressor and station.
    - >-
      Setpoint recommender that minimizes recycle and fuel use subject to surge
      margin, throughput, and reliability constraints; outputs operator-ready
      setpoints/MOC notes.
    - >-
      Emissions inference engine that classifies and quantifies venting/fugitive
      events from pressure/flow/valve telemetry; integrates optional
      aerial/OGI/mobile data to calibrate factors.
    - >-
      Automated regulatory reporting: OGMP 2.0 Level 4/5 workflows, EPA Subpart
      W estimates tied to operating states, support for Methane Emissions
      Reduction Program fee analytics.
    - >-
      Operational alerts: anti-surge proximity, recycle duty, seal gas leakage
      indicators, blowdown detection, VRU downtime, rod-pack leak signatures
      (recips), with triage and work orders.
    - >-
      Fleet KPIs and benchmarking: $/MMscf compressed, hp-utilization, methane
      intensity (kg CH4/MMBtu), recycle hours per 1,000 run-hours, detected vent
      volumes and time-to-detect.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously optimize compressor setpoints and detect methane emissions
    using existing sensors—cut fuel use 2–5%, reduce recycle hours 30–60%, and
    identify >5 scf/min emissions within minutes—while generating audit-ready,
    measurement-informed inventories for OGMP 2.0 and EPA reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A measurement-informed emissions inference library tied to compressor
    operating states and setpoint optimization, built from multi-operator
    datasets; deep integrations with controller vendors enabling safe,
    actionable setpoint recommendations; compliance-grade audit trails accepted
    by OGMP 2.0 reviewers and aligned with EPA methods.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations managers, compression engineers, and ESG leaders at natural gas
    producers (NAICS 211130) who want dependable throughput at the lowest fuel
    cost and methane footprint—without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: energy lost to recycle/anti-surge behavior, unplanned trips,
    fugitive/venting emissions, and tightening methane regulations. Internal:
    data overload and uncertainty about optimal setpoints across changing
    conditions. Philosophical: wasting saleable gas and emitting methane when it
    can be prevented is unacceptable.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit production, reliability, and emissions
    targets at once. Our team blends compression engineering and machine
    learning, integrates with your SCADA/PLCs, and delivers transparent,
    cyber-secure insights that support compliance reporting.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historian/SCADA and compressor metadata. 2) Baseline efficiency,
    anti-surge/recycle patterns, and emissions indicators with site-specific
    models. 3) Deliver advisory setpoints, anomaly alerts, and ROI reporting;
    iterate with your team.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot on one station.
    Transitional: Download a sample optimization and emissions report.
  success: >-
    Measurable reductions in fuel/power use and methane intensity, fewer surges
    and trips, higher stable throughput within constraints, and auditable
    reports that satisfy internal targets and external expectations.
  failure: >-
    Persistent recycle losses, avoidable surge events and downtime, undetected
    venting/leaks, missed methane goals and potential penalties, higher
    operating costs, and eroded stakeholder trust.
