  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned recycle/anti-surge events and suboptimal setpoints waste fuel
      gas (1–5% efficiency loss per unit) and increase CO2e.
    - >-
      Episodic methane venting (blowdowns, seal vents, VRU upsets) and fugitive
      leaks go undetected for weeks, triggering regulatory risk and methane
      fees.
    - >-
      Lack of unified view: operations optimize throughput and reliability;
      ESG/compliance teams need quantifiable, auditable emissions data; systems
      are siloed.
    - >-
      Existing controls (OEM/PLC) protect equipment but rarely recommend
      economic setpoints across changing field conditions (gas composition,
      suction pressure, ambient).
    - >-
      Manual LDAR/periodic surveys miss intermittent emissions; continuous
      monitoring hardware is costly to deploy at scale.
    - >-
      Operators lack standardized, measurement-informed inventories (OGMP 2.0
      Level 4/5) and near-real-time Subpart W estimates tied to operating
      states.
  solution:
    - >-
      Software-only AI layer ingesting historian/SCADA (e.g., PI, Ignition) and
      controller tags (CCC, Woodward) to build a live digital twin of each
      compressor and station.
    - >-
      Setpoint recommender that minimizes recycle and fuel use subject to surge
      margin, throughput, and reliability constraints; outputs operator-ready
      setpoints/MOC notes.
    - >-
      Emissions inference engine that classifies and quantifies venting/fugitive
      events from pressure/flow/valve telemetry; integrates optional
      aerial/OGI/mobile data to calibrate factors.
    - >-
      Automated regulatory reporting: OGMP 2.0 Level 4/5 workflows, EPA Subpart
      W estimates tied to operating states, support for Methane Emissions
      Reduction Program fee analytics.
    - >-
      Operational alerts: anti-surge proximity, recycle duty, seal gas leakage
      indicators, blowdown detection, VRU downtime, rod-pack leak signatures
      (recips), with triage and work orders.
    - >-
      Fleet KPIs and benchmarking: $/MMscf compressed, hp-utilization, methane
      intensity (kg CH4/MMBtu), recycle hours per 1,000 run-hours, detected vent
      volumes and time-to-detect.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously optimize compressor setpoints and detect methane emissions
    using existing sensors—cut fuel use 2–5%, reduce recycle hours 30–60%, and
    identify >5 scf/min emissions within minutes—while generating audit-ready,
    measurement-informed inventories for OGMP 2.0 and EPA reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A measurement-informed emissions inference library tied to compressor
    operating states and setpoint optimization, built from multi-operator
    datasets; deep integrations with controller vendors enabling safe,
    actionable setpoint recommendations; compliance-grade audit trails accepted
    by OGMP 2.0 reviewers and aligned with EPA methods.

    producers (NAICS 211130) who want dependable throughput at the lowest fuel
    cost and methane footprint—without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: energy lost to recycle/anti-surge behavior, unplanned trips,
    fugitive/venting emissions, and tightening methane regulations. Internal:
    data overload and uncertainty about optimal setpoints across changing
    conditions. Philosophical: wasting saleable gas and emitting methane when it
    can be prevented is unacceptable.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit production, reliability, and emissions
    targets at once. Our team blends compression engineering and machine
    learning, integrates with your SCADA/PLCs, and delivers transparent,
    cyber-secure insights that support compliance reporting.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historian/SCADA and compressor metadata. 2) Baseline efficiency,
    anti-surge/recycle patterns, and emissions indicators with site-specific
    models. 3) Deliver advisory setpoints, anomaly alerts, and ROI reporting;
    iterate with your team.

    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot on one station.
    Transitional: Download a sample optimization and emissions report.
  success: >-
    Measurable reductions in fuel/power use and methane intensity, fewer surges
    and trips, higher stable throughput within constraints, and auditable
    reports that satisfy internal targets and external expectations.
  failure: >-
    Persistent recycle losses, avoidable surge events and downtime, undetected
    venting/leaks, missed methane goals and potential penalties, higher
    operating costs, and eroded stakeholder trust.
