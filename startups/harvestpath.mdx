  problem:
    - >-
      Harvest layout is slow and iterative: delineating unit boundaries, landing
      sites, skid trails, and access under slope, soils, and buffer regulations
      often takes 4–16 hours per unit and multiple field visits.
    - >-
      Compliance risk is high: stream buffers, steep-slope limits, and
      road-crossing rules vary by jurisdiction; manual checks lead to buffer
      encroachments, excess crossings, or soil disturbance that trigger fines or
      rework.
    - >-
      Skid network inefficiency: suboptimal landings and trail layout increase
      average skidding distance and machine cycle time, inflating cost per
      ton/m3 and fuel burn by 10–25%.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: planners juggle DEM/LiDAR, hydro, soils, ownership,
      machine specs, and operational constraints across ArcGIS/QGIS, CAD, OEM
      apps, and paper maps.
    - >-
      Limited field connectivity: many tools break down offline; foresters and
      operators can’t easily adjust plans in the woods or capture “as-built”
      data to improve future plans.
    - >-
      Talent bandwidth: experienced layout foresters are scarce; smaller
      contractors and consultants can’t scale capacity or standardize quality
      across crews and geographies.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated unit boundary proposal: Given objectives (target acreage/volume,
      stand/compartment polygons), the assistant generates boundaries that
      respect adjacency, steep slope limits, riparian buffers, and ownership
      lines.
    - >-
      Landing site optimizer: Identifies feasible landing locations based on
      slope (<10–12%), aspect, proximity to existing roads, turning radius, and
      soil bearing strength; scores and ranks options.
    - >-
      Skid trail network planner: Generates a least-cost network from landings
      to cut areas with tunable penalties for slope, soils, stream crossings,
      and maximum spacing; constrained by machine capabilities (tracked vs
      wheeled, cable settings).
    - >-
      Access route planning: Proposes new spur roads or use of existing roads
      with grade constraints (e.g., <12%), minimal earthwork, and crossing
      minimization; provides estimated build/maintenance cost.
    - >-
      Regulatory template engine: Jurisdiction-specific BMPs and riparian rules
      (e.g., buffer widths by stream class, slope-triggered buffers) applied
      automatically; emits compliance checklists and maps.
    - >-
      Scenario comparison: Side-by-side plans comparing cost-to-deliver, average
      skid distance, crossings count, soil disturbance risk index, and
      schedule—choose and publish the best scenario.
    - >-
      Field-ready outputs: Offline mobile maps (GeoPDF, MBTiles) and
      shapefiles/GeoJSON for Avenza, TimberMatic Maps, Trimble Forestry, and
      Esri; QR-coded paper maps as fallback.
    - >-
      As-built capture and learning loop: Ingest machine GNSS tracks and
      operator notes to compare planned vs actual; autotunes cost parameters and
      continuously improves recommendations.
    - >-
      Time and cost estimator: Estimates cycle times, fuel consumption, and
      $/ton or $/m3 impacts from plan variants; supports budgeting and mill
      negotiations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-assisted harvest unit and access planning that produces compliant,
    machine-aware unit boundaries, landings, and skid networks in minutes,
    reducing planning time by up to 80%, skidding cost by 10–15%, and buffer
    violations to near zero—export-ready to field devices and GIS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization leveraging anonymized as-built machine tracks and
    outcomes to continuously tune cost surfaces and machine-specific parameters,
    combined with a maintained, jurisdiction-specific BMP rules engine and deep
    integrations with both GIS (Esri) and OEM field ecosystems—hard for general
    GIS tools or OEM-only apps to replicate end-to-end.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Foresters, timberland managers, and logging planners who need safe,
    compliant, and profitable harvest layouts—fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: Complex terrain, SMZ/stream buffers, machine limits, and tight
    timelines make layout tedious and risky.

    - Internal: Uncertainty about grades, soil impact, permits, and truck access
    undermines confidence.

    - Philosophical: Good forestry shouldn’t hinge on guesswork—it should be
    data‑driven stewardship.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve flagged units, walked slopes, and negotiated BMPs—we know the
    pressure.

    Authority: Built by foresters and GIS/AI engineers; field‑tested with
    DEM/LiDAR; aligns with BMPs and common regulatory constraints. The Harvest
    Unit & Access Planning Assistant integrates with your GIS to turn
    constraints into clear, workable plans.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Upload tract boundary, DEM/LiDAR, streams/roads, and rules (slope limits,
    SMZ widths, equipment, landings).

    2) AI proposes unit boundaries, landings, skid trails, and access routes;
    scores options for grade, cost, and impact.

    3) Review/edit on map; lock choices; export Shapefile/GeoPackage/PDF maps
    and turn‑by‑turn directions.

    Agreement:

    - Transparent assumptions and editable constraints.

    - You own the data; no changes without approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on your next tract.

    Transitional: Book a 20‑minute demo or download a sample plan and savings
    estimate.
  success: |-
    - Hours to plans, not weeks.
    - Safer grades and stable trails; fewer crossings and soil disturbance.
    - BMP‑compliant layouts that satisfy regulators and landowners.
    - Lower layout/hauling costs and improved yield.
    - Clear, audit‑ready documentation for crews and stakeholders.
  failure: |-
    - Fines, rework, and delays from noncompliant or incomplete layouts.
    - Unsafe grades, stuck equipment, and blocked truck access.
    - Erosion, excessive crossings, and damaged landowner trust.

  problem:
    - Unit and access layout takes days of GIS work and field revisions.
    - >-
      Balancing volume, haul distance, soil risk, and cost is complex and
      error‑prone.
    - >-
      Stream buffers and steep-slope exclusions are hard to enforce
      consistently.
    - 'Ad hoc plans lead to more crossings, disturbed area, and compliance risk.'
