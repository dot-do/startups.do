  problem:
    - >-
      Specialty nonferrous mills suffer 1–5% scrap/rework rates; each 0.5% FPY
      loss can cost $0.5–$2M per plant per year in lost margin and expedited
      rework.
    - >-
      Lab confirmation of mechanical/chemical properties (e.g., tensile,
      hardness, composition) lags production by 2–12 hours, causing continued
      production of out-of-family coils before issues are discovered.
    - >-
      Manual SPC on a handful of tags misses multivariate interactions among
      >200 process variables (speed, reduction, temp, lube chemistry, die wear,
      coil temps), leading to undetected drift.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge driven; engineers spend
      6–12 hours per significant deviation stitching LIMS results with historian
      trends.
    - >-
      Frequent grade/size changeovers create transient conditions; static
      control limits generate excessive false alarms, lowering operator trust.
    - >-
      Missed early warnings lead to unplanned downgrades or certification
      failures (e.g., NADCAP/aerospace), risking late deliveries and
      chargebacks.
    - >-
      Inconsistent data (tag naming, historian gaps, LIMS delays) prevents
      scalable analytics across lines and plants.
    - >-
      APC/controls optimize targets but lack near-line quality outcome
      prediction and do not integrate lab results for closed-loop quality
      learning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data connectors unify process tags (PI, OPC UA, MQTT) and LIMS records
      (mechanical/chemical tests) into a time-aligned, unit-of-production view
      (heat/coil/batch/press run).
    - >-
      Multivariate SPC (e.g., dynamic PCA/Hotelling T2, EWMA) layered with
      unsupervised ML (isolation forest/autoencoder) and supervised quality
      predictors trained on past lab results to detect out-of-family behavior.
    - >-
      Concept drift handling: rolling-window model updates and
      grade/size/route-aware segmentation; automatic recalculation of control
      limits per product family and changeover state.
    - >-
      Causal hinting: event correlation and SHAP-based feature attribution tie
      anomalies to likely drivers (e.g., emulsion pH drop, die run-length,
      furnace soak variance, speed/reduction combo).
    - >-
      Early-warning estimator: predicts probability of lab failure/out-of-spec
      before results are back; targets 1–6 hours lead time depending on test
      lag.
    - >-
      Operator and engineer UX: one-screen coil timeline with badges for
      anomalies, recommended checks, and guided 5-why; alarm suppression and
      “explain why normal” views to build trust.
    - >-
      Action library: configurable playbooks (adjust coolant concentration,
      inspect roll chatter, swap die) with estimated impact and closure
      tracking.
    - >-
      MLOps and governance: versioned models per line/product, audit trails for
      ISO/NADCAP, and sandbox A/B to compare new limits/models vs. baseline.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem (containers/k8s) with air-gapped support or
      hybrid cloud; no PLC changes required.
    - >-
      Security and reliability: role-based access, PI AF/asset model alignment,
      <200 ms historian query latency, 99.5% service uptime SLO.
    - >-
      Change management: operator training modules, digital champions, and
      adoption KPIs with weekly improvement huddles.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-line, interpretable quality anomaly detection that fuses lab outcomes
    with process tags to flag out-of-family coils/batches hours earlier than lab
    confirmation and suggests likely causes, reducing scrap/rework by 20–40% and
    improving FPY by 1–3%, with zero-rip-and-replace integration to your
    historian, LIMS, and MES.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned, interpretable multivariate quality models and causal templates
    for specialty nonferrous processes, plus a proven playbook that merges lab
    outcomes and historian tags into near-line decisions with audited evidence
    packs—backed by prebuilt connectors and AF templates that cut integration
    time by 50–70% and reduce false alarms during changeovers.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality, process, and operations leaders at nonferrous (except copper and
    aluminum) rolling, drawing, and extruding mills who want stable,
    spec-compliant output, fewer surprises, and clear causes when drift happens.
  problem: >-
    - External: Late lab confirmations, noisy process tags, alloy variability,
    and frequent changeovers let out-of-family coils/batches slip to finishing
    and customers.

    - Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting, unsure which levers matter, and
    blind to cross-shift variability.

    - Philosophical: Quality should not be a surprise; plant data should prevent
    defects, not just record them.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand complex metallurgy, short runs, and tight specs
    make SPC alone hard in nonferrous mills.

    - Authority: Our SPC+ML service fuses lab results with process tags to model
    normal, flag anomalies near-line, and suggest likely causes. Built for
    industrial environments; integrates with PI/Ignition/MES/LIMS; deployable
    on-prem or in a private cloud with strong security.
  plan: >-
    - Process plan: 1) Connect and align historian tags, MES/LIMS lab results,
    and coil/batch genealogy. 2) Baseline and deploy SPC limits and ML models;
    validate with your experts; enable near-line scoring and alerts. 3) Improve
    and scale with operator guidance, cause suggestions, dashboards, and
    periodic model refresh.

    - Agreement plan: Pilot 4–8 weeks on a critical line with clear success
    metrics; fixed-fee pilot; your data stays under your control; security
    review included; rollout and training on success.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a discovery call and data readiness check; launch a pilot
    on your highest-impact product family.

    - Transitional: Get the playbook and sample dashboards; request an ROI
    estimate using your scrap and rework data.
  success: |-
    - Fewer out-of-family coils and customer returns.
    - Earlier detection (minutes, not weeks) and faster release decisions.
    - Clear likely causes and best-known process windows per alloy and product.
    - Higher yield and OEE with less rework and inspection burden.
    - Stronger audit readiness with traceability from tag to certificate.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing firefighting, late surprises, and expensive rework or recalls.
    - Lost margin and capacity from hidden variability and over-control.
    - Eroding customer trust and tougher audits.
