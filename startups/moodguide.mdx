  problem:
    - >-
      Design teams spend 8–20 hours per project to compile moodboards, CMF
      palettes, and starter style guides from scattered references and
      constraints.
    - >-
      Brand consistency breaks: 35–60% of first-round concepts are rejected for
      off-brief color/typography/usage rule violations.
    - >-
      CMF workflows are siloed from digital brand work; mapping
      Pantone/RAL/material finishes to digital HEX/RGB is manual and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Onboarding new designers to brand constraints takes 2–6 weeks; tacit rules
      are not documented as machine-checkable constraints.
    - >-
      Existing tools (Pinterest/Milanote/Canva) help collect references but
      don’t transform them into enforceable, exportable guidelines or tokens.
    - >-
      Enterprises require governance (SSO, audit, rights checks, WCAG contrast)
      that generic AI image tools don’t provide.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload inputs: brand constraints (logos, colors, type, tokens), references
      (images/links), audience/market brief, optional CMF/material library.
    - >-
      AI generates 3–5 moodboard directions with rationale, each with: 8–12
      color swatches (HEX/RGB/Pantone/RAL), material/finish suggestions (if CMF
      enabled), type pairings (3–6), iconography style starters, and usage
      rules.
    - >-
      Automated checks: brand compliance score (0–100), WCAG contrast analysis,
      cultural/brand safety flags, IP/license checks on referenced assets.
    - >-
      Interactive refinement: lock constraints, accept/reject elements,
      regenerate variants; version control with diff and rationale.
    - >-
      One-click exports: Figma styles/tokens, Adobe CC libraries, brand portal
      templates (Frontify/Bynder), printable CMF sheets.
    - >-
      Governance for teams: SSO, roles, approval workflows, audit logs,
      enterprise content policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn references and brand constraints into production-ready moodboards, CMF
    palettes, typography/iconography starters, and enforceable usage rules in
    hours, not weeks—exportable to Figma/Adobe, checked for brand and
    accessibility compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Constraint-first generation with a proprietary brand compliance scoring
    engine and CMF mapping dataset, plus deep integrations (tokens/plug-ins)
    that convert AI outputs into enforceable, exportable brand systems—not just
    images.

    Authority: our AI turns inputs into moodboards, CMF palettes,
    typography/iconography starters, and usage rules that teams can ship.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload references and brand constraints; 2) Generate moodboards, CMF
    palettes, typography/iconography, and draft usage rules; 3) Review, refine,
    and export a starter style guide.
