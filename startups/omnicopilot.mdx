  problem:
    - Knowledge and frontline workers lose 20–40 percent of their time on repetitive digital work: searching, summarizing, documenting, scheduling, data entry, follow-ups, and status reporting.
    - Existing copilots are siloed inside single apps (Docs, Email, CRM) and cannot execute end-to-end workflows across tools with permissions, scheduling, and approvals.
    - Generic chatbots lack job-specific context, tool access, and governance, leading to low accuracy, hallucinations, and poor ROI.
    - Enterprises need data security, auditability, and compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA where needed) and struggle to adopt bring-your-own-bot solutions safely.
    - ROI is not consistently measurable; teams need clear baselines and ongoing telemetry (time saved, success rate, error rate, cost per task).
    - Frontline and field roles are underserved; most assistants are desktop-first and not optimized for voice, offline, and mobile workflows.
    - Change management friction: long setup, unclear first use-cases, and no path from chat to automation reduce activation and retention.
  solution:
    - Job-aware agent platform: a single copilot that loads an occupation-specific skill pack (e.g., Sales, Support, AP/AR, IT help desk) and adapts to org policies and data.
    - Deep tool integrations: 100+ connectors (email, calendar, docs, CRM, ERP, ticketing, HRIS, messaging, RPA) with granular permissions and admin governance.
    - End-to-end workflow execution: from understanding a request to drafting, enriching with data, executing tasks in connected apps, and collecting approvals when required.
    - Evaluation and safety system: built-in guardrails, retrieval-augmented generation, human-in-the-loop review, red team prompts, and measurable accuracy scoring by task type.
    - Marketplace of skill packs: curated role/industry playbooks and automations with revenue share for partners and internal COE teams.
    - Mobile and voice-first clients: offline support, dictation, quick actions, and on-device inference options for low-latency tasks.
    - Observability and ROI analytics: time saved, cost per task, success/error rates, and latency dashboards for admins and team leads.
    - Data residency and privacy: regional hosting, customer-managed keys, on-prem and VPC deployment options for regulated customers.
    - Model routing and optimization: vendor-agnostic LLM orchestration to minimize cost/latency while maintaining accuracy and compliance.
    - Approval and compliance workflows: policy-based controls that require human sign-off for sensitive actions (e.g., payments, privilege escalations).
  uniqueValueProp: One secure, job-aware copilot that connects to your tools, understands your role, and executes end-to-end workflows with approvals—delivering measurable time saved and accuracy across occupations, not just inside one app.
  unfairAdvantage: A cross-occupation evaluation and workflow telemetry dataset that improves accuracy and ROI over time, combined with a marketplace of role-specific skill packs and deep integrations. Vendor-agnostic model routing and strong governance enable adoption in regulated environments. Network effects arise as organizations and partners publish and refine playbooks that others adopt and rate, compounding quality and stickiness.
  customerSegments:
    - Primary: Mid-market and enterprise organizations (200–5,000+ employees) using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, initially in Sales, Customer Support, Finance/Accounting, IT Service Desk, and Operations.
    - Secondary: SMBs and prosumers needing cross-tool automation and task execution with strong privacy controls.
    - Regulated verticals over time: Healthcare administration, Financial services back office, Legal operations (with strict governance).
    - Frontline/field teams: Construction site supervisors, maintenance technicians, retail ops leaders, logistics coordinators (mobile- and voice-first).
    - Developers and IT: For integration, administration, and building occupation-specific skill packs via the marketplace.
  channels:
    - Product-led growth: freemium desktop/browser extension, Slack/Teams app with 14–30 day trials and in-product upsell.
    - Marketplaces: Microsoft AppSource, Google Workspace Marketplace, Slack App Directory, Salesforce AppExchange, ServiceNow Store, Atlassian Marketplace.
    - Enterprise sales: targeting VP Sales/CS, Support Ops, Finance Ops, and CIO for security buy-in; land with 50–200 seat pilots.
    - Partners: MSPs and SIs for deployment and change management; co-sell with cloud providers and RPA vendors.
    - Content and community: occupation-specific playbooks, benchmark reports, webinars, and certification programs for admins and builders.
    - Field and frontline distribution: mobile app stores, device management partners, and industry associations (construction, retail, logistics).
  revenueStreams:
    - Per-seat subscriptions: Starter 15–20 USD per user per month, Pro 35–45 USD per user per month, Enterprise 60–90 USD per user per month with SSO, SCIM, DLP, and advanced governance.
    - Usage-based automation credits: metered by action minutes or tokens for high-volume workflows; volume discounts for enterprise.
    - Vertical skill pack add-ons: premium role/industry packs at 5–20 USD per user per month.
    - Marketplace revenue share: 20–30 percent take rate on third-party skill packs and connectors.
    - Professional services and onboarding: fixed-fee pilots 10–50k USD; integrations and custom playbooks.
    - Private/VPC or on-prem deployment: annual platform fee 50–250k USD plus seats; data residency add-ons.
  costStructure:
    - COGS: LLM inference and embedding costs, vector storage, GPU/CPU compute, observability, and RPA workload runners.
    - Cloud infrastructure: multi-region Kubernetes, networking, backups, key management, and data residency zones.
    - Engineering and product: core platform, integrations team, evaluation/safety team, and mobile/desktop clients.
    - Go-to-market: sales, marketing, marketplace enablement, partner management, and customer success.
    - Compliance and security: SOC 2/ISO audits, penetration tests, privacy counsel, and bug bounty.
    - Support and operations: tiered support, solution architects, annotation/human-in-the-loop reviewers for quality assurance.
  keyMetrics:
    - Acquisition and activation: signup-to-connector-link rate target 60 percent; time-to-first-automation under 10 minutes P50; Week 1 activation over 40 percent.
    - Engagement: weekly active users over monthly active users ratio over 55 percent for paid teams; median weekly tasks per user greater than 8 by Day 30.
    - Outcome metrics: median time saved per task greater than 30 percent vs baseline; task success rate over 85 percent; human override rate under 15 percent by Day 60.
