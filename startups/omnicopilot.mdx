  problem:
    - Knowledge and frontline workers lose 20–40 percent of their time on repetitive digital work: >-
        searching, summarizing, documenting, scheduling, data entry, follow-ups,
        and status reporting.
    - >-
      Existing copilots are siloed inside single apps (Docs, Email, CRM) and
      cannot execute end-to-end workflows across tools with permissions,
      scheduling, and approvals.
    - >-
      Generic chatbots lack job-specific context, tool access, and governance,
      leading to low accuracy, hallucinations, and poor ROI.
    - >-
      Enterprises need data security, auditability, and compliance (SOC 2, ISO
      27001, HIPAA where needed) and struggle to adopt bring-your-own-bot
      solutions safely.
    - >-
      ROI is not consistently measurable; teams need clear baselines and ongoing
      telemetry (time saved, success rate, error rate, cost per task).
    - >-
      Frontline and field roles are underserved; most assistants are
      desktop-first and not optimized for voice, offline, and mobile workflows.
    - Change management friction: >-
        long setup, unclear first use-cases, and no path from chat to automation
        reduce activation and retention.
  solution:
    - Job-aware agent platform: >-
        a single copilot that loads an occupation-specific skill pack (e.g.,
        Sales, Support, AP/AR, IT help desk) and adapts to org policies and
        data.
    - Deep tool integrations: >-
        100+ connectors (email, calendar, docs, CRM, ERP, ticketing, HRIS,
        messaging, RPA) with granular permissions and admin governance.
    - End-to-end workflow execution: >-
        from understanding a request to drafting, enriching with data, executing
        tasks in connected apps, and collecting approvals when required.
    - Evaluation and safety system: >-
        built-in guardrails, retrieval-augmented generation, human-in-the-loop
        review, red team prompts, and measurable accuracy scoring by task type.
    - Marketplace of skill packs: >-
        curated role/industry playbooks and automations with revenue share for
        partners and internal COE teams.
    - Mobile and voice-first clients: >-
        offline support, dictation, quick actions, and on-device inference
        options for low-latency tasks.
    - Observability and ROI analytics: >-
        time saved, cost per task, success/error rates, and latency dashboards
        for admins and team leads.
    - Data residency and privacy: >-
        regional hosting, customer-managed keys, on-prem and VPC deployment
        options for regulated customers.
    - Model routing and optimization: >-
        vendor-agnostic LLM orchestration to minimize cost/latency while
        maintaining accuracy and compliance.
    - Approval and compliance workflows: >-
        policy-based controls that require human sign-off for sensitive actions
        (e.g., payments, privilege escalations).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One secure, job-aware copilot that connects to your tools, understands your
    role, and executes end-to-end workflows with approvals—delivering measurable
    time saved and accuracy across occupations, not just inside one app.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-occupation evaluation and workflow telemetry dataset that improves
    accuracy and ROI over time, combined with a marketplace of role-specific
    skill packs and deep integrations. Vendor-agnostic model routing and strong
    governance enable adoption in regulated environments. Network effects arise
    as organizations and partners publish and refine playbooks that others adopt
    and rate, compounding quality and stickiness.
