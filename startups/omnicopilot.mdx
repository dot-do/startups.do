  vision: "Every knowledge worker empowered with a job-aware AI copilot that executes end-to-end workflows across all their tools."
  mission: "Transform repetitive digital work into automated, measurable workflows with occupation-specific intelligence and enterprise-grade governance."
  purpose: "Unlock human potential by eliminating 20-40% of repetitive digital tasks across all occupations."
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - Knowledge and frontline workers lose 20–40 percent of their time on repetitive digital work: searching, summarizing, documenting, scheduling, data entry, follow-ups, and status reporting.
    - Existing copilots are siloed inside single apps (Docs, Email, CRM) and cannot execute end-to-end workflows across tools with permissions, scheduling, and approvals.
    - Generic chatbots lack job-specific context, tool access, and governance, leading to low accuracy, hallucinations, and poor ROI.
    - Enterprises need data security, auditability, and compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA where needed) and struggle to adopt bring-your-own-bot solutions safely.
    - ROI is not consistently measurable; teams need clear baselines and ongoing telemetry (time saved, success rate, error rate, cost per task).
    - Frontline and field roles are underserved; most assistants are desktop-first and not optimized for voice, offline, and mobile workflows.
    - Change management friction: long setup, unclear first use-cases, and no path from chat to automation reduce activation and retention.
  solution:
    - Job-aware agent platform: a single copilot that loads an occupation-specific skill pack (e.g., Sales, Support, AP/AR, IT help desk) and adapts to org policies and data.
    - Deep tool integrations: 100+ connectors (email, calendar, docs, CRM, ERP, ticketing, HRIS, messaging, RPA) with granular permissions and admin governance.
    - End-to-end workflow execution: from understanding a request to drafting, enriching with data, executing tasks in connected apps, and collecting approvals when required.
    - Evaluation and safety system: built-in guardrails, retrieval-augmented generation, human-in-the-loop review, red team prompts, and measurable accuracy scoring by task type.
    - Marketplace of skill packs: curated role/industry playbooks and automations with revenue share for partners and internal COE teams.
    - Mobile and voice-first clients: offline support, dictation, quick actions, and on-device inference options for low-latency tasks.
    - Observability and ROI analytics: time saved, cost per task, success/error rates, and latency dashboards for admins and team leads.
    - Data residency and privacy: regional hosting, customer-managed keys, on-prem and VPC deployment options for regulated customers.
    - Model routing and optimization: vendor-agnostic LLM orchestration to minimize cost/latency while maintaining accuracy and compliance.
    - Approval and compliance workflows: policy-based controls that require human sign-off for sensitive actions (e.g., payments, privilege escalations).
  uniqueValueProp: One secure, job-aware copilot that connects to your tools, understands your role, and executes end-to-end workflows with approvals—delivering measurable time saved and accuracy across occupations, not just inside one app.
  unfairAdvantage: A cross-occupation evaluation and workflow telemetry dataset that improves accuracy and ROI over time, combined with a marketplace of role-specific skill packs and deep integrations. Vendor-agnostic model routing and strong governance enable adoption in regulated environments. Network effects arise as organizations and partners publish and refine playbooks that others adopt and rate, compounding quality and stickiness.
  customerSegments:
    - Primary: Mid-market and enterprise organizations (200–5,000+ employees) using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, initially in Sales, Customer Support, Finance/Accounting, IT Service Desk, and Operations.
    - Secondary: SMBs and prosumers needing cross-tool automation and task execution with strong privacy controls.
    - Regulated verticals over time: Healthcare administration, Financial services back office, Legal operations (with strict governance).
    - Frontline/field teams: Construction site supervisors, maintenance technicians, retail ops leaders, logistics coordinators (mobile- and voice-first).
    - Developers and IT: For integration, administration, and building occupation-specific skill packs via the marketplace.
  channels:
    - Product-led growth: freemium desktop/browser extension, Slack/Teams app with 14–30 day trials and in-product upsell.
    - Marketplaces: Microsoft AppSource, Google Workspace Marketplace, Slack App Directory, Salesforce AppExchange, ServiceNow Store, Atlassian Marketplace.
    - Enterprise sales: targeting VP Sales/CS, Support Ops, Finance Ops, and CIO for security buy-in; land with 50–200 seat pilots.
    - Partners: MSPs and SIs for deployment and change management; co-sell with cloud providers and RPA vendors.
    - Content and community: occupation-specific playbooks, benchmark reports, webinars, and certification programs for admins and builders.
    - Field and frontline distribution: mobile app stores, device management partners, and industry associations (construction, retail, logistics).
  revenueStreams:
    - Per-seat subscriptions: Starter 15–20 USD per user per month, Pro 35–45 USD per user per month, Enterprise 60–90 USD per user per month with SSO, SCIM, DLP, and advanced governance.
