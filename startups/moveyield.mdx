leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile demand by day-of-week/season and ZIP code causes weekend
      over-booking and mid-week idle trucks, depressing contribution margins.
    - >-
      Most movers use static rate cards and manual discounts; they lack
      granular, data-driven pricing tied to truck capacity, crew availability,
      and travel time.
    - >-
      Lead-gen platforms (Angi, Thumbtack, etc.) commoditize quotes, triggering
      price wars and margin compression without improving fleet utilization.
    - >-
      Dispatchers juggle minimum hours, overtime, drive time, and no-shows using
      spreadsheets; there is no closed-loop system to match price to capacity in
      real time.
    - >-
      Compliance constraints (filed tariffs, posted rates, minimums) limit ad
      hoc price changes; lack of guardrails risks fines or chargebacks.
    - >-
      No reliable forecasting of job duration by service type/ZIP/crew, causing
      misquotes, unbillable hours, and cancellations.
    - >-
      Owners lack visibility into true RevPAR/truck, price elasticity, and promo
      ROI; experimentation is rare or unstructured.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven yield management that adjusts hourly rates, minimum hours,
      travel fees, and promos per date/truck/ZIP to hit target utilization and
      margin constraints.
    - >-
      Short-horizon demand forecasting (ZIP × service type × day-part) and
      job-duration models to price jobs to true time/cost and reduce
      overtime/cancellations.
    - >-
      Guardrailed optimization engine that respects filed tariffs, minimums, and
      franchise pricing policies; configurable floors/ceilings and approval
      workflows.
    - >-
      Promotion calendar and discount depth optimizer to pull demand from peaks
      to shoulder days; overbooking limits tied to historical no-show/cancel
      rates.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration with TMS/CRM to ingest quotes, bookings,
      calendars, and crew capacity; push recommendations or auto-apply rules
      with change logs.
    - >-
      A/B and holdout testing to measure incremental revenue and conversion
      uplift; transparent dashboards and weekly executive summaries.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase revenue per truck by 8–15% and lift utilization by 4–8 points in 90
    days with compliant, automated pricing that adapts by date, truck, and
    ZIP—no process change required, measurable via controlled experiments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-fleet pricing and demand dataset aggregated via TMS integrations
    enables superior elasticity estimates and seasonality baselines by ZIP;
    combined with a tariff-aware optimization engine and experiment framework,
    it delivers measurable uplift with regulatory safety—difficult to replicate
    quickly.
