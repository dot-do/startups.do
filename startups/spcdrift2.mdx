leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Out-of-control CTQ characteristics (e.g., overall length, powder charge
      weight, bullet runout, primer depth, neck tension, case head diameter) are
      detected hours or days after production, causing large scrap quarantines.
    - >-
      Manual SPC (clipboards/Excel/Minitab exports) delays decision-making;
      operators don’t get real-time feedback at the press/assembly station.
    - >-
      Changeovers, tooling wear, and powder lot switches introduce slow
      distribution drift missed by classic control charts, degrading velocity
      SD, pressure, and grouping consistency.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across gages, PLCs, vision systems, and ballistic labs; no
      unified, auditable lot genealogy that ties CTQs to ballistic outcomes and
      machine settings.
    - >-
      Audit readiness (ISO 9001/AS9100, defense QARs, SAAMI/NATO tolerances) is
      time-consuming; evidence collection across runs/lots is manual and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is inconsistent; gage bias/GRR issues
      pollute control limits and trigger false alarms.
    - >-
      Alarm fatigue: too many false positives from naive thresholds; operators
      ignore alarms or bypass checks.
    - >-
      Air-gapped/ITAR environments restrict cloud analytics; typical SaaS tools
      don’t fit on-prem OT networks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an on-prem/edge analytics node that ingests CTQ measurements and
      machine/vision signals in real time via OPC UA, Modbus/TCP, file drops,
      and gage APIs.
    - >-
      Use hybrid SPC: classic control charts (I-MR, X̄-R, EWMA, CUSUM) plus
      multivariate T2/PCA and streaming change-point detection to flag
      mean/variance shifts and concept drift early.
    - >-
      Ammo-specific templates: preloaded CTQ libraries and control plans per
      caliber and process step aligned to SAAMI/NATO specs and common tooling
      setups.
    - >-
      Closed-loop, human-in-the-loop alerts at the line HMI/andon (stack light,
      horn, on-screen SOP) with recommended actions tied to likely root cause
      (e.g., die wear counter threshold, feeder recalibration, primer seating
      force check).
    - >-
      Lot genealogy and electronic batch record (EBR): automatically link line
      settings, gage reads, and ballistic lab results to lots/sub-lots;
      one-click audit packages.
    - >-
      MSA toolkit: GRR studies, bias/linearity checks; auto-flag suspect gages
      and quarantine their data from control-limit calculations.
    - >-
      Ballistics correlation: integrate chronograph/pressure data to optimize
      control limits for velocity SD/ES and pressure consistency; suggest
      setpoint tweaks post-powder-lot changeover.
    - >-
      Offline-first, ITAR-compliant updates; optional enterprise server for
      cross-plant KPIs and benchmarking with air-gap-friendly sync.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Ammo-specific, on‑prem AI SPC that detects slow drift and out-of-control
    conditions in minutes, links CTQs to ballistic results, and guides operators
    to corrective actions—while meeting ITAR/CMMC constraints and reducing scrap
    15–30%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammo-specialized SPC/drift models and control-plan templates validated
    against real ballistic outcomes, delivered as ITAR-compliant, offline-first
    edge software with prebuilt OT/metrology connectors—reducing time-to-value
    from months to weeks and outperforming generic SPC tools in alarm precision
    and operator guidance.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality managers and process engineers in small‑arms ammunition plants who
    need every lot to meet spec, ship on time, and pass audits without
    firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual SPC, delayed feedback, and siloed data let subtle drifts
    (charge weight, neck tension, COAL, velocity/pressure) slip through—causing
    scrap, rework, and recall risk.

    Internal: Constant worry about being surprised by an out‑of‑control lot,
    audit fatigue, and nights spent chasing root causes.

    Philosophical: Ammunition must be safe and consistent—quality should be
    proactive, not reactive.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of high‑stakes, discrete manufacturing where a
    missed drift can become a safety issue. Our team blends manufacturing data
    science with SPC best practices (X‑bar/R, EWMA, CUSUM) to automate
    monitoring and provide auditable, secure records aligned to ISO/AS9100/SAAMI
    expectations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate gauges, vision/CMM, scales, test barrels/chronos,
    MES/ERP; define CTQ specs.

    2) Configure: Auto‑learn baselines, set control limits and drift detectors;
    validate with your team.

    3) Control: Monitor in real time, alert the right people, and guide
    containment/CAPA from one dashboard.

    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo and start a pilot on one line.
    Transitional: Download the SPC readiness checklist and ROI estimator.
  success: >-
    Stable processes, fewer surprises, and confident releases. Faster detection
    and correction, less scrap/rework, clean audit trails, on‑time delivery, and
    a reputation for safe, reliable ammunition.
  failure: >-
    Late drift detection, firefighting, and missed shipments. Costly scrap,
    failed audits, margin erosion, potential recalls, and damage to customer
    trust.
