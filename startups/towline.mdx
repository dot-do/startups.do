  problem:
    - >-
      Towing companies miss 10–30% of after-hours/overflow calls, directly
      losing high-margin jobs.
    - >-
      Dispatchers waste 2–5 minutes per call verifying location, service type,
      and pricing—leading to long hold times and caller abandonment.
    - >-
      Human answering services lack towing-specific knowledge (mile markers,
      rotation rules, weight classes) causing misquotes and misroutes (3–10% job
      fallout).
    - >-
      Small fleets (1–10 trucks) can’t staff 24/7 without burning out owners or
      overpaying; large fleets face variable spikes during weather events.
    - >-
      Location and quote inaccuracies create disputes and chargebacks; operators
      need consistent documentation and call recordings for compliance.
    - >-
      Integrations to Towbook/Omadi/Tracker, telematics, and payments are
      fragmented; multi-channel intake (voice/SMS/chat) is not unified.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI voice/SMS/webchat agent that greets, triages (breakdown vs accident vs
      impound vs roadside service), and gathers essentials (name, callback,
      vehicle, service type).
    - >-
      Location capture via SMS link (one-tap share),
      cross-street/mile-marker/exit lookup, address normalization, and geofence
      validation to coverage areas.
    - >-
      Dynamic quoting engine by service type: base hook fee + per-mile
      (loaded/unloaded), wait time, winch-out, off-road surcharge,
      heavy/medium/light duty, after-hours differentials, municipal caps;
      returns firm or pre-auth estimate depending on business rule.
    - >-
      Instant booking: creates job in dispatch software (Towbook/Omadi/Tracker),
      assigns priority, suggests closest truck/ETA; optional pre-auth payment or
      deposit capture.
    - >-
      Escalation to human dispatcher/owner on defined triggers (accident with
      injury, police rotation, heavy-duty, language barrier, angry caller,
      out-of-coverage).
    - >-
      Bilingual support (EN/ES to start) with configurable scripts for branding,
      disclaimers, and municipal compliance notes.
    - >-
      Full audit trail: call recordings/transcripts, location snapshot, quote
      breakdown, consent/logs, and reason codes for fallout/cancellations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 towing-specialized AI that answers calls/SMS/chat, verifies precise
    location, quotes accurately, and books jobs in under 90 seconds—with
    seamless human escalation. Reduce missed calls by 60%+, cut after-hours
    labor cost by 40–70%, and achieve 95%+ location accuracy and <5% quote error
    rate.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built towing domain models (mile-marker parsing, service-class
    detection, quoting rules) trained on proprietary transcripts and outcomes,
    plus deep integrations with leading tow dispatch systems that generic IVAs
    and human answering services lack. Accumulated quote-to-actual variance data
    enables uniquely accurate pricing and lower fallout.
