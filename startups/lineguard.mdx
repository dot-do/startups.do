  problem:
    - >-
      Leak detection on gas transmission lines must balance sensitivity and
      false alarms; existing CPM (computational pipeline monitoring) systems
      often struggle during transients (startups/shutdowns/compressor changes),
      causing alarm fatigue and slow responses.
    - >-
      Regulatory and ESG pressure (PHMSA 49 CFR Part 192, API RP 1130/1175,
      methane fee under IRA/MERP) require demonstrable performance,
      documentation, and continuous improvement—operators lack measurable,
      audit-ready evidence of detection performance.
    - >-
      Manual triage and inconsistent workflows slow time-to-detect and
      time-to-localize; incident routing is fragmented across SCADA, PI
      historians, emails, and work management tools.
    - >-
      Sensor drift, bad actors (frozen transmitters, mis-calibrations), and data
      latency degrade mass-balance accuracy; operators need automated data
      quality checks and uncertainty-aware scoring.
    - >-
      Retrofitting hardware-based solutions (e.g., fiber optic DAS) is expensive
      and slow; operators want software-first incremental gains without
      control-system risk (advisory-only).
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time stream processing of flows, pressures, temperatures,
      compressor/valve states, and gas properties to compute dynamic linepack
      and segment mass-balance deficits.
    - >-
      Transient-aware leak scoring using change-point detection,
      physics-informed priors, and Bayesian filters to separate operational
      transients from leak signatures.
    - >-
      Probabilistic leak localization using multi-end pressure/flow correlations
      and wave-speed cues; outputs confidence bands on location and estimated
      leak rate (as % of flow and MSCFD).
    - >-
      Automated data quality and uncertainty quantification (sensor drift
      checks, latency checks, plausibility bounds) to suppress spurious alarms.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations that route advisories to control room consoles and
      work management (e.g., PI Vision, Ignition, SCADA alarm lists read-only
      mirror, ServiceNow/Maximo), with playbooks aligned to API 1175.
    - >-
      Backtesting and reporting suite that quantifies true/false alarm rates,
      time-to-detect/localize, and minimum detectable leak (MDL) by operating
      mode for audits and continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Advisory-only AI that fuses mass-balance with transient-aware features to
    deliver faster leak likelihood and location scoring with lower false
    alarms—deployable via read-only SCADA/historian integration, audit-ready for

  unfairAdvantage: >-

    datasets with audit-ready backtesting, delivered through an advisory-only,

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline control-room and integrity teams who need continuous, trustworthy
    leak likelihood and location signals—without replacing existing systems.
  problem: >-
    External: Transient operations and noisy SCADA obscure real leaks;
    mass-balance alone over/under-alerts, risking safety, emissions, and
    compliance. Internal: Teams feel blind during starts/stops, face alert
    fatigue, and lack dispatch confidence. Philosophical: Operators deserve
    clear, defensible insights from the data they already collect.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pressure to detect early while avoiding costly false
    dispatches in dynamic gas networks. Authority: We apply proven mass-balance
    analytics enhanced with transient pattern cues, uncertainty bounds, and
    auditable scoring—integrated read-only with your historian and aligned with
    API 1130/1175 best practices.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Data readiness and risk mapping (tags, meters, topology,
    elevations). 2) Calibrate and validate in shadow mode on
    historical/simulated events; set sensitivities and routing. 3) Go-live
    advisory monitoring: deliver likelihood score, location window, and
    estimated rate; route to incident workflows; iterate via monthly reviews.
    Assurance: Read-only, advisory-only, no control logic changes; secure,
    auditable, and configurable; operator retains decision authority.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and scope a 60-day pilot on a
    representative segment. Transitional: Request the methodology brief and
    sample alert package.
  success: >-
    Earlier, more confident detection; fewer false alarms; faster triage and
    targeted field response; reduced gas loss and methane emissions; auditable
    reports for stakeholders; improved MTTA/MTTR; stronger regulator/insurer
    confidence and community trust.
  failure: >-
    Undetected or late leaks, unnecessary dispatches, higher gas loss and
    emissions, regulatory findings and fines, reputational damage, and avoidable
    downtime.

  problem:
    - Small leaks hide in noise; transients mimic leak signatures.
    - Manual checks are slow and inconsistent across shifts.
    - High false alarms erode trust and waste truck rolls.

    - Alerts don’t flow into the right SOC/field workflows.
    - Regulators expect measurable detection performance and auditability.
  solution:
    - Always-on mass-balance with transient-aware models to cut through noise.
    - Real-time leak likelihood scoring with confidence levels.
    - Estimated leak location along the line and leak rate range.
    - Smart alerting and auto-routing into your existing workflows.
    - 'Advisory-only: no control actions—zero operational risk.'

      (diameter, elevation, stations, valves).
    - Calibrate using 30–90 days of history; learn normal transient patterns.
    - >-
      Validate on historical events and simulated leaks; tune thresholds to
      targets.
    - >-
      Configure routing: alert tiers, recipients, ticketing/on-call
      integrations.
    - Go live in shadow mode; compare against existing alarms and refine.
