  title: AI Pre‑Underwriting Summarizer (Consumer/Auto/Personal)
  description: >-
    Summarizes loan files, computes key ratios, flags stipulations, and proposes
    decision drafts/counter-offers.
  targetUsers:
    - Underwriting
    - Lending Ops
    - Branch LOs

    - OCR (Textract)
    - Policy engine (simple rules)
    - Azure OpenAI/Claude for memo drafting

  problem:
    - >-
      Underwriters spend 20–40 minutes per file aggregating documents, computing
      DTI/PTI/LTV, and writing notes, creating bottlenecks during peak volume.
    - >-
      Manual ratio calculations and missing stipulations drive 10–20% rework
      rates and inconsistent decisions across underwriters and branches.
    - >-
      Loan Origination Systems (LOS) contain unstructured notes; managers lack
      standardized, audit-ready rationales for actions required by ECOA/Reg B
      and NCUA.
    - >-
      Indirect auto channels (e.g., dealer-arranged) create high-volume
      variability; staff struggle to keep SLAs for response times, hurting
      dealer/membership experience.
    - >-
      Staffing is tight: hiring experienced underwriters is costly (fully loaded
      $80–110k/FTE) and training cycles are long; backlogs increase pull-through
      drop-off and member churn.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure requires consistent documentation of reasons for
      approval/denial/counter-offer and auditable decision trails; manual
      processes are error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest application data and documents from LOS via native connectors;
      normalize and enrich with bureau and employer/income data when available.
    - >-
      Automatically compute key ratios (DTI, PTI, LTV/CLTV, residual income,
      verification of capacity) and check against CU policy thresholds and risk
      tiers.
    - >-
      Flag missing/invalid stipulations (proof of income, collateral docs, POI
      gaps, POF, POI frequency mismatches, ID, residence, insurance) with
      evidence citations.
    - >-
      Generate draft decision memos: approve/decline/counter‑offer with reasons,
      conditions, and alternative structures (e.g., lower amount, longer term,
      co‑signer).
    - >-
      Provide an explainability pane linking each recommendation to the specific
      document/extract and policy rule that triggered it (Reg B‑ready
      rationale).
    - >-
      Offer an underwriter console to review, edit, and finalize; track
      overrides and feedback to continuously improve models (human‑in‑the‑loop).
    - >-
      Deliver dashboards for managers: cycle time, rework rate, override rate,
      stip miss rate, SLA adherence, and fair lending documentation coverage.
    - >-
      Expose APIs and webhooks to push summaries and decisions back to LOS
      notes, tasks, and audit logs; support PDF export for audits.
    - >-
      Security/compliance by design: SOC 2 Type II, data residency in US, PII
      encryption at rest/in transit, role‑based access, detailed audit trails. 
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    1‑click, audit‑ready pre‑underwriting summaries that compute key ratios,
    flag missing stips, and draft decision/counter‑offer options aligned to your
    credit policy—cutting decision cycle time by 40%+ and reducing rework while
    improving consistency and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A CU‑tuned, explainable LLM+policy engine trained on diverse credit union
    policies and annotated decision trails, delivered through native LOS
    connectors and backed by audit‑grade rationale—hard to replicate quickly by
    generic AI vendors or LOS incumbents.
  customerSegments:
