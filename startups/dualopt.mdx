  title: Cost‑Optimal Dual‑Purpose Ration Formulation
  description: >-
    Optimizes rations for lactating, dry, and grower groups using on‑farm
    feeds/byproducts to meet milk and gain targets at lowest cost.
  targetUsers:
    - Owners/managers
    - Nutritionists

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Feed accounts for 55–70% of total production cost in dual‑purpose systems;
      price volatility and seasonal scarcity cause margin compression
    - >-
      Small and mid‑size ranches lack access to qualified nutritionists; rations
      often copied from neighbors or feed reps, leading to over/underfeeding
    - >-
      On‑farm feeds and crop byproducts are underutilized due to unknown
      nutrient values and inconsistent availability
    - >-
      Current tools are generic, not adapted to dual‑purpose goals that must
      balance milk yield and weight gain simultaneously
    - >-
      Limited connectivity, language barriers, and low digital literacy hinder
      adoption of complex software
    - >-
      No simple way to run least‑cost scenarios that respect fiber, energy, and
      protein constraints for lactating, dry, and grower groups
    - >-
      Inadequate monitoring of KPIs like Income Over Feed Cost (IOFC), feed cost
      per kg milk, and average daily gain (ADG)
    - >-
      Overreliance on feed mills for free rations creates bias toward their
      products rather than least‑cost on‑farm options
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile and web app that ingests on‑farm feed inventory, prices, and lab or
      library analyses
    - >-
      AI‑assisted setup for lactating, dry, and grower groups with targets for
      milk, body condition, and ADG
    - >-
      Least‑cost solver with nutrient constraints (NDF, peNDF, ME/NE, RDP/RUP,
      starch, Ca:P, max urea, fat limits, mycotoxin flags)
    - >-
      Local feed library for common crop residues and byproducts; seasonal
      availability modeling with alerts and substitutes
    - >-
      Scenario and sensitivity analysis: What if milk price drops 10% or maize
      rises 20%? Recommended ration adjustments
    - >-
      Outcome feedback loop: learns from recorded yields/gains to re‑tune
      constraints for each farm’s genetics, climate, and management
    - >-
      Offline‑first with SMS/USSD workflows for data entry and ration delivery;
      multilingual UI
    - >-
      Integration APIs for feed labs, milk meters, scales, co‑op ERPs;
      QR/printable ration sheets for pen feeders
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI‑driven, offline‑capable ration optimization that turns your own feeds and
    byproducts into the lowest‑cost, nutritionally sound diets for lactating,
    dry, and grower groups—boosting milk, gain, and IOFC with localized data and
    simple workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed‑loop dataset linking ration composition, local feeds, prices, and
    observed milk/gain outcomes across diverse tropical and subtropical
    systems—continuously improving farm‑specific recommendations. Combined with
    an offline‑first, multilingual stack and distribution via co‑ops, labs, and
    processors, this creates data network effects and defensible access to
    last‑mile farmers.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Dual‑purpose cattle ranchers and mixed crop–livestock farmers who need
    reliable, low‑cost rations for lactating, dry, and grower groups.
  problem: >-
    Ration balancing is complex and time‑consuming; prices and nutrients vary;
    guesswork causes overspending, waste, and missed milk/gain targets.
  guide: >-
    An AI ration formulator using proven dairy/beef nutrition models that turns
    your on‑farm feeds/byproducts into the lowest‑cost plan that still meets
    performance goals.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload feed inventory, nutrient analyses, and targets. 2) Get
    cost‑optimal rations per group with alternatives and sensitivity. 3)
    Implement, monitor results, and auto‑adjust as prices and inventory change.
  callToAction: Start with a free ration audit and setup call.
  success: >-
    Lower feed cost per liter/kg gain, stable milk and average daily gain (ADG),
    less waste, faster decisions, and stronger margins from the same land and
    herd.
  failure: >-
    Keep overpaying for feed, wasting byproducts, and missing production goals
    while margins tighten.

    title: Cost-Optimal Dual-Purpose Ration Formulation
    subtitle: >-
      AI that hits milk and weight-gain targets at the lowest feed cost using
      your own forages and byproducts.
    ctaText: Start optimizing rations
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - >-
      Feed is your biggest cost, yet rations are built on guesswork or
      spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Lactating, dry, and grower groups need different nutrition—but plans are
      one-size-fits-all.
    - >-
      On-farm feeds and byproducts are underused, raising reliance on expensive
      purchased feed.
    - Price swings and forage variability make rations outdated within days.
    - >-
      Overfeeding safety margins wastes money; underfeeding hurts milk and
      growth.
    - Limited access to nutrition expertise slows decisions and results.
  solution:
    - 'AI-driven ration plans tailored to lactating, dry, and grower groups.'
    - >-
      Optimizes cost using on-farm feeds first, then fills gaps with market
      options.
    - >-
      Balances nutrients to meet milk yield and average daily gain targets—no
      performance trade-offs.
    - 'Auto-adjusts as prices, inventories, or forage tests change.'
    - Delivers mixer-ready as-fed batch sheets for pens and groups.
  features:
    - 'Group-specific optimization: lactating, dry, and grower/heifer rations.'
    - >-
      On-farm feeds and byproducts prioritized; market feeds added only as
      needed.
    - >-
      Targets: daily milk, components, and average daily gain with intake
      constraints.
    - >-
      Nutrient balancing per NRC or custom limits (ME/NE, RDP/RUP, NDF/peNDF,
      minerals).
    - >-
      Forage variability handling: plug in lab/NIR results or use localized
      defaults.
    - 'Price and scenario analysis: what-if on costs, availability, and targets.'
    - Inventory-aware planning with seasonality and lot tracking.
    - >-
      Health guards: fiber and starch limits, DCAD/heat-stress checks, acidosis
      risk flags.
    - >-
      Clear outputs: dry matter and as-fed quantities, mixer batch sheets,
      pen-level splits.
    - >-
      Performance tracking and alerts when milk, gain, or intakes deviate from
      plan.
  steps:
    - 'Enter herd groups and targets (milk, ADG, intake).'
    - 'Add available feeds/byproducts, nutrient analyses, and current prices.'
    - 'Set constraints and preferences (use on-farm first, inventory limits).'
    - Run optimization to generate cost-minimized rations for each group.
    - >-
      Review and export mixer sheets; monitor results and auto-adjust as
      conditions change.
