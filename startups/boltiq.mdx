leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier and freight volatility erodes margins: FX swings of 3–8%/quarter
      and freight surcharges change monthly, but list prices are updated 1–2
      times/year, creating 150–300 bps unpriced cost increases.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: landed cost depends on supplier quotes, duties, FX, and
      freight; these live in spreadsheets, emails, and ERP, causing 2–4 week
      cycle times to roll price changes across customer tiers.
    - >-
      Conflicting price lists: duplicate, overlapping, or outdated lists across
      ERP, EDI, and B2B portals lead to mispriced orders and credits; 0.5–1.5%
      revenue at risk in credits/rebills.
    - >-
      Margin leaks go undetected: overrides, freight under-recovery,
      unit-of-measure errors (bolt vs yard), and minimum order waivers cause
      silent leakage of 50–200 bps.
    - >-
      Tiered pricing complexity: hundreds of matrices by
      customer/region/channel; manual maintenance scales linearly with SKUs and
      customers; teams can only touch the top 10–20% SKUs.
    - >-
      No elasticity or willingness-to-pay insight: list moves are blanket
      percentages; high-velocity SKUs could bear more, long-tail may need
      guardrails; 10–20% of SKUs are over- or under-priced by >5%.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit risk: lack of version control and approvals for price
      changes; customers challenge increases due to missing cost-to-price
      traceability.
    - >-
      Slow quote response and price realization: quotes take hours/days to
      validate correct price and freight; realization drops to 88–92% of target
      due to errors/overrides.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data consolidation: ingest supplier price updates (CSV/PDF/EDI),
      FX feeds, duties, and freight matrices to compute SKU-level landed cost by
      lane/incoterm.
    - >-
      Price optimization by customer tier: recommend list and tier adjustments
      by SKU/customer segment using guardrails (elasticity, floor margins,
      competitor bands).
    - >-
      List reconciliation engine: detect duplicates, overlaps, outdated or
      conflicting entries across ERP, EDI, and B2B portals; propose canonical
      lists and safe merges.
    - >-
      Margin leak detection: identify under-recovered freight/fuel, unauthorized
      overrides, UoM conversion errors, MOQ/price break anomalies, and contract
      non-compliance.
    - >-
      Scenario sandbox and approvals: simulate changes (e.g., +3% FX, new
      freight) and see margin/revenue impact by customer; route for approval
      with audit trails.
    - >-
      One-click publishing: push approved lists to ERP price matrices, EDI
      catalogs, and B2B/e-commerce portals; notify sales of notable customer
      impacts.
    - >-
      Monitoring and alerts: watch FX/freight thresholds, supplier updates, and
      margin KPIs; trigger targeted micro-adjustments instead of blanket
      increases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native pricing and list reconciliation built for piece goods and notions
    distributors: consolidate supplier/FX/freight to compute landed cost in real
    time, propose margin-safe price changes by customer tier, reconcile
    conflicting lists across systems, and surface margin leaks—delivering
    150–300 bps margin uplift and 50–80% faster price cycles with full
    auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized pricing IP and reconciliation models tailored to piece
    goods/notions (UoM nuances, dye lots, price breaks, incoterms), plus
    prebuilt ERP/EDI connectors that enable closed-loop publishing and rapid
    time-to-value; growing anonymized benchmarks on FX/freight pass-through and
    leak patterns create a data flywheel competitors lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Mid-market import-heavy wholesalers of piece goods, notions,
      trims, craft supplies, upholstery and home textile inputs (annual revenue
      $20M–$500M; 50–50,000 SKUs; multi-tier price matrices).
    - >-
      Secondary: Large enterprises in apparel/textile distribution with complex
      regional price lists and global sourcing.
