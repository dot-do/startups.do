  problem:
    - >-
      Official CPI releases are monthly with 2–6 week lags; monetary policy
      committees need higher-frequency reads to decide on rates, guidance, and
      communications.
    - >-
      Existing vendor models often lack explainability and audit trails; central
      banks must meet model risk management standards (e.g., SR 11-7, ECB TRIM,
      BoE MRM) and defend estimates to internal committees and the public.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous data sources (web prices, scanner data, fuel, FX, freight,
      PMIs, weather, taxes) are fragmented; ingestion, cleansing, and versioning
      are costly to build and maintain in-house.
    - >-
      Structural breaks (supply shocks, tax changes, price caps) degrade model
      stability; detecting regime shifts and recalibrating models is nontrivial.
    - >-
      Data sovereignty, security, and procurement constraints require
      on-premise/sovereign cloud deployments, role-based access, and full
      auditability.
    - >-
      Leadership needs actionable attribution (drivers by COICOP class/outlet)
      and scenario fan charts, not just point forecasts, to guide communications
      and risks.
    - >-
      Talent bandwidth: many central banks cannot hire/retain specialized
      ML/data engineering teams to build and operate weekly pipelines at
      production quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Produce weekly CPI nowcasts (headline/core and selected sub-indices) using
      an ensemble of Bayesian mixed-frequency models and ML with
      regime-switching and change-point detection.
    - >-
      Deliver calibrated fan charts (e.g., 50/70/90% intervals) and scenario
      overlays (tax changes, FX shocks, fuel price moves) with clear
      assumptions.
    - >-
      Provide driver attribution using Shapley-style contributions and
      decomposition by COICOP levels (divisions→classes→items), with source
      citations and archived snapshots of inputs.
    - >-
      Automate data ingestion: connectors for official series (SDMX),
      web-scraped prices (compliant scraping with robots and legal review),
      scanner data, fuel/power tariffs, FX, futures, freight, PMIs, weather,
      VAT/excise changes.
    - >-
      Quality control pipeline: anomaly detection, outlier handling,
      missing-data imputation, and reproducible data versioning with audit logs.
    - >-
      Governance-by-design: full lineage, model cards, backtests, challenger
      models, validation packs aligned to SR 11-7/ECB/BoE guidance; role-based
      access, segregation of duties.
    - >-
      Flexible deployment: on-premise, sovereign cloud (AWS GovCloud/Azure
      Government/region-locked), or managed service; API-first for BI
      integration (Power BI/Tableau) and secure export to research notebooks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflows: analyst notes, override with justification,
      and reproducible sign-off to support internal committees and public
      communications.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Auditable, weekly inflation nowcasts with driver attribution and
    drill-downs, tailored to each country’s CPI basket, deployable
    on-premise/sovereign cloud, and compliant with central-bank model risk
    standards—so policy makers can act with timely, explainable evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Audit-grade explainability down to COICOP item level with source citations
    and archived evidence, combined with deployment in sovereign/on-prem
    environments and a ready-to-use model risk documentation pack—capabilities
    that most vendors and in-house teams lack simultaneously.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Central bank policymakers and research teams (NAICS 521110) who need timely,
    defensible inflation insight to set rates and communicate with the public.
  problem: >-
    External: CPI is lagged; high-frequency signals are noisy and siloed; manual
    aggregation is slow. Internal: pressure to act with incomplete evidence and
    justify decisions. Philosophical: the public deserves transparent,
    evidence-based policy grounded in traceable data.
  guide: >-
    We understand the scrutiny and stakes of monetary policy. Our AI
    agent—Inflation Nowcasting and Drivers Explorer—was built by macroeconomists
    and ML engineers, validated on historical vintages, fully cited and
    explainable, and deployable securely (on‑prem/VPC).
  plan: >-
    1) Securely connect approved data sources. 2) Receive weekly CPI nowcasts,
    fan charts, and driver attribution with drill-downs and citations. 3) Review
    in a policy dashboard, export to briefs/speeches, and iterate with our team
    during a 4‑week pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a security-cleared demo and 4‑week pilot, or request a sample
    weekly report + methodology brief.
  success: >-
    Faster, defensible inflation read; clearer risk bounds; traceable drivers by
    sector and item; tighter policy meetings; improved public communication and
    credibility; fewer surprises.
  failure: >-
    Continue relying on lagged, fragmented signals; slower policy response;
    conflicting narratives; preventable forecast misses and credibility risks.
