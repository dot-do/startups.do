  problem:
    - >-
      Agents and brokers spend 20–60 hours per month reconciling commissions
      across 10–100+ suppliers/buyers; effort scales linearly with volume and
      formats.
    - >-
      Statement heterogeneity (PDF, Excel, EDI, portal HTML) leads to data-entry
      errors; 97%+ accuracy required to be useful, but manual processes
      typically hover at 92–95% line-level accuracy.
    - >-
      Commission short-pays and rate errors of 0.5–2.0% of gross commissions
      often go undetected due to volume and complex contract terms (tiers,
      brackets, retro, channel exclusions).
    - >-
      Dispute packets take 1–3 hours each to assemble (evidence, line-level
      diffs, contract citations), delaying recovery and hurting cash flow.
    - >-
      Lack of audit trail and SLA tracking causes stalled disputes, duplicate
      follow-ups, and write-offs within 60–120 days.
    - >-
      Onboarding new principals/customers is slow (2–8 weeks) due to mapping new
      statement formats and encoding commission rules.
    - >-
      Leaders lack visibility into true recovery rate, dispute cycle times, and
      supplier error hot spots, hampering negotiation leverage.
    - >-
      Compliance and data security requirements (SOC 2, PII handling) make DIY
      automation risky and expensive.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal ingestion of supplier/buyer statements (PDF/Excel/EDI/portal)
      with AI extraction and vendor-specific templates.
    - >-
      Commission rules engine encodes principal/buyer agreements (rates, tiers,
      retro adjustments, SKU/category exceptions, ship-to/bill-to logic,
      currency).
    - >-
      Automated reconciliation that compares expected vs. paid at line, order,
      and account levels; flags variances with root-cause codes (rate error,
      missing invoice, quantity mismatch, returns/chargebacks).
    - >-
      One-click dispute packet generation: cover letter, variance schedule,
      supporting documents (PO/invoice/remittance/contract excerpts), and
      submission guidance per counterparty.
    - >-
      Workflow and SLA tracking for disputes: owners, due dates, escalations,
      communications log, and outcomes for continuous learning.
    - >-
      Analytics: recovery rate, short-pay hotspots by supplier/buyer, recurring
      issues, and negotiation insights.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common ERPs/CRMs to push journal entries, accruals,
      and status updates.
    - >-
      Security-first platform (SOC 2 path), full audit trail, role-based access,
      PII masking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate commission reconciliation and dispute recovery for wholesale agents
    and brokers. Achieve 97–99% line-level match, recover 0.5–2.0% of annual
    commissions, and cut month-end close time by 70–90%. AI turns unstructured
    statements and complex contracts into auditable payouts and ready-to-send
    dispute packets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and a growing network effect: every mapped supplier
    format, contract pattern, and resolved dispute improves accuracy and
    guidance for all customers. Paired with a flexible commission rules engine
    and outcome feedback loops, this creates a defensible template/rules moat
    and faster time-to-value than generic AP/AR or SPM tools.
  customerSegments:

      (5–500 employees) in industrial/electrical, electronics components,
