  problem:
    - >-
      Missed or late RFIs/change orders cause lost revenue (typical finish
      carpentry shop misses $1,500–$5,000/month in unbilled extras due to
      undocumented scope drift).
    - >-
      Drafting a compliant RFI/CO is slow and inconsistent (30–90 minutes each
      for photos, plan markups, quantity breakdowns, pricing, and schedule
      impact wording).
    - >-
      Poor documentation leads to rejection by GCs/owners (lack of backup, wrong
      numbering, no schedule language).
    - >-
      Small shops lack standardized pricing libraries and contract language
      expertise.
    - >-
      Field-to-office handoff is broken (texts/photos scattered across phones;
      delays kill entitlement).
    - >-
      Existing project platforms are built for GCs and are heavy for subs;
      finish carpentry needs trade-specific templates and cost models.
    - >-
      Limited integrations create double data entry into Procore/Autodesk
      Build/QuickBooks/Buildertrend.
    - >-
      Language barriers and variability in writing quality reduce approval
      rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile-first capture: photo/voice note selects project; app auto-extracts
      context (location, drawing sheet, spec section).
    - >-
      AI drafting: converts input into formal RFI or CO with plan/PDF markups,
      itemized labor/materials, schedule impact, and contract references.
    - >-
      Pricing engine: region- and union-aware labor rates, productivity factors,
      and material markups; supports T&M and lump-sum.
    - >-
      Workflow & delivery: internal review/approval, automatic numbering,
      e-signature, email to GC/owner, and status tracking with reminders.
    - >-
      System of record: searchable log of RFIs/COs, attachments, audit trail,
      and integration sync to Procore/Autodesk Build/Buildertrend/QuickBooks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Capture a jobsite issue in 2 minutes; send a compliant, priced, and
    defensible RFI or Change Order in under 15 minutes—integrated with your GC
    and accounting tools—so you never leave money on the table.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A trade-specialized corpus of accepted RFIs/COs with pricing and schedule
    outcomes, powering fine-tuned templates that consistently pass GC scrutiny;
    coupled with deep integrations that push/pull to the systems subs already
    use—creating a feedback loop that improves acceptance rates and pricing
    accuracy over time.
