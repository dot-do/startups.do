  problem:
    - >-
      Manual punchlists consume 5–10 hours/week per PM/foreman, are
      inconsistent, and miss issues that lead to rework/back charges (1–3% of
      contract value).
    - >-
      Walkthrough photos/videos are captured but rarely structured into
      actionable tasks; evidence is scattered across phones, texts, and cloud
      drives.
    - >-
      Closeout drags due to unclear ownership, missed follow-ups, and lack of
      proof of completion, delaying payment draws and retainage release by 1–3
      weeks.
    - >-
      Trade-specific defects (e.g., missed firestopping, gaps in batt
      insulation, screw pops, unfinished seams, damaged boards, exposed vapor
      barriers) are hard to systematically detect at scale.
    - >-
      GCs increasingly demand digital punchlists and photo documentation tied to
      locations and plans; subs struggle to meet requirements without
      heavyweight GC platforms.
    - >-
      Field conditions (poor connectivity, 1000s of images, mixed 360/standard
      media) make existing generic tools slow or unusable on site.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Capture via mobile app or import from phone albums, 360 cameras
      (Ricoh/Insta360), OpenSpace/Autodesk Build exports.
    - >-
      Detect: AI models trained on drywall/insulation defects auto-tag issues
      (e.g., missing batt at penetrations, unsealed top plates, screw pops,
      un-taped joints).
    - >-
      Structure: Convert findings to tasks with location (room/level), severity,
      code/spec reference, and recommended fix; map to floorplan/area names used
      by the GC.
    - >-
      Assign & Drive: Auto-assign to crews/vendors; set due dates based on
      project schedule; escalate with SMS/email/app reminders; track
      acknowledgments.
    - >-
      Verify: Require photo/video evidence for closure; AI checks that fix is
      compliant (e.g., full cavity fill, proper tape/compound coverage) before
      manager sign-off.
    - >-
      Report & Handover: One-click PDF/CSV exports, Procore/Autodesk sync, audit
      trail for pay apps/retainage release and GC handover packages.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn jobsite photos and videos into a ready-to-assign punchlist tailored to
    drywall & insulation—then drive task closure with automated reminders and
    verifiable photo proof. Reduce closeout time 25–40%, cut rework/back charges
    15–30%, and get paid faster.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously expanding dataset and defect ontology specific
    to drywall/insulation, collected via closed-loop feedback from field users
    and verified by trade experts; on-device preview for low-connectivity sites;
    and deep integrations that output GC-ready deliverables with minimal change
    to foremen workflows.
