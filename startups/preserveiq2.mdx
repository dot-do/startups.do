  problem:
    - >-
      Wet-chemistry assays (e.g., digestion + ICP) are slow (24–72 hours),
      delaying shipment release and increasing WIP and storage costs.
    - >-
      Per-sample lab costs are high ($40–$120/sample) and scale with throughput;
      overtime and courier costs add variability.
    - >-
      Manual COA preparation is error-prone and inconsistent across sites;
      auditors demand traceable, standard-compliant documentation.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time feedback; OOS lots are often discovered after
      full production runs, causing scrap/rework and customer penalties.
    - >-
      Instrument and operator variability (moisture, species, surface treatment)
      cause inconsistent predictions when using generic NIR models.
    - >-
      Regulatory/standards compliance (AWPA/EN 351) requires auditable sampling,
      retention verification, and archival—difficult with spreadsheets/emails.
    - >-
      Existing chemometrics tools require in-house expertise, ongoing
      calibration maintenance, and offer limited OOS/outlier detection or drift
      alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      On-instrument or edge gateway app captures NIR/FTIR spectra at line-side
      and predicts preservative retention and penetration class in seconds.
    - >-
      Model-driven OOS flagging with uncertainty and outlier detection;
      auto-routes flagged samples for confirmatory lab assay.
    - >-
      Automated COA generator with e-signature, AWPA/EN 351 references, sampling
      records, instrument calibration status, and full audit trail.
    - >-
      Calibration transfer and standardization across instrument brands;
      site-specific model adaptation without retraining from scratch.
    - >-
      LIMS/ERP integration (APIs, CSV/SFTP, OPC UA) to embed results in release
      workflows; centralized dashboards across plants.
    - >-
      Drift monitoring (species mix, moisture, instrument health) with alerts
      and recommended recalibration/standard checks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, audit-ready retention verification and automated COAs for treated
    wood. Cut QC cycle time from days to minutes, reduce lab spend by 50–80%,
    and prevent OOS shipments with instrument-agnostic, validated NIR/FTIR
    models aligned to AWPA/EN 351.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-chemistry, multi-species spectral dataset paired with reference
    assays collected from diverse plants and instruments; validated
    calibration-transfer IP; and early acceptance by auditors through published
    equivalency studies and OEM-certified integrations—creating high switching
    costs and regulatory trust competitors cannot easily replicate.
