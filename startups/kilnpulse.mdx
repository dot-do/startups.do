leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of kilns, calciners, blowers, and pumps drive costly
      downtime (kiln/calciner outages frequently exceed $20k–$80k/hour due to
      lost throughput, energy waste, and restart scrap).
    - >-
      Maintenance is reactive or time-based; failure modes like refractory
      spalling, bearing wear, seal leakage, impeller erosion, and pump
      cavitation are detected late because alerts rely on static thresholds.
    - >-
      Historian and CMMS data exist (e.g., AVEVA PI, Aspen IP.21, SAP PM/IBM
      Maximo) but are siloed; work order history is unstructured, making it hard
      to learn from past failures.
    - >-
      Spare parts and contractor lead times are long; planners lack a reliable
      predicted failure window (P–F interval) to schedule work safely and
      efficiently.
    - >-
      Plants face stringent safety and environmental constraints (PSM/OSHA,
      emissions) that require early detection and planned interventions to avoid
      incidents and flare/vent penalties.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: Native connectors to AVEVA PI/Aspen IP.21/OPC-UA and
      CMMS (SAP/Maximo); automated tag mapping, asset hierarchy sync, and
      work-order parsing (NLP) to extract failure modes and repair actions.
    - >-
      Asset health models: Hybrid ML + physics-informed models for
      kilns/calciners (heat/mass balance, refractory condition proxies, drive
      torque trends) and rotating equipment (bearings/seals/impeller wear,
      cavitation, imbalance).
    - >-
      Predictive alerts: RUL and P–F interval estimates with confidence, anomaly
      root-cause candidates, and recommended actions; alert precision tuning by
      operating regime (startup/steady-state/transient).
    - >-
      Maintenance planning: Pushes prioritized notifications into CMMS, proposes
      job plans, parts lists, and target windows aligned to production schedules
      and supplier lead times.
    - >-
      Performance and risk: Quantifies avoided downtime cost, energy savings,
      and risk reduction; dashboards for MTBF/MTTR, alert quality
      (precision/recall), and value realized.
    - >-
      Change management: Operator rounds mobile app, explainability views for
      control room acceptance, and post-event learning loop to continuously
      improve models.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built predictive maintenance for thermal and rotating equipment in
    petroleum/coal product manufacturing that turns historian and work order
    history into weeks of actionable lead time, with explainable RUL estimates
    and maintenance-ready work orders that cut unplanned downtime 20–40% and
    maintenance costs 10–20% within 6–12 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-plant dataset of kiln/calciner and abrasive-service rotating
    equipment failures aligned to historian signals and work-order text,
    enabling earlier and more reliable P–F interval predictions than generalist
    APM tools; plus deep CMMS integration that outputs maintenance-ready job
    plans and parts recommendations.

  character: >-
    Maintenance, reliability, and operations leaders at NAICS 324199 plants who
    must keep kilns, calciners, blowers, and pumps running to hit production,
    safety, and cost targets.
  problem: >-
    - External: Unplanned downtime, thermal excursions, bearing and seal
    failures, fouling, and hidden degradation in rotating and thermal assets.

    - Internal: Teams stuck in firefighting; time-based PMs miss early warnings;
    hard to justify parts and labor without evidence.

    - Philosophical: You should not be surprised by failures when historian and
    work-order data already hold the signals.
  guide: >-
    We understand 24/7 high-temperature, abrasive service where one trip can
    stall the line. Our reliability engineers and data scientists use historian
    trends and work-order history to train asset-specific models, validated with
    your SMEs. Secure, IT-OT friendly integration and proven process-industry
    deployments build confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Read-only link to your historian and CMMS; define critical
    assets and failure modes. 2) Model: Clean and label with WO history;
    engineer features; train and validate predictive models with SMEs. 3) Act:
    Deploy advance alerts and recommended actions into maintenance workflow;
    review results in weekly huddles. 4) Scale: Add assets, refresh models,
    track ROI; deploy on-prem or VPC with cybersecurity controls.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery and start a 6-8 week pilot on 10
    critical assets. Transitional: Request the ROI calculator and pilot
    checklist.
  success: >-
    - Fewer unplanned outages; more planned work and shorter turnarounds.

    - Higher throughput and OEE with more stable kiln and calciner operation.

    - Lower maintenance and energy cost per ton; safer and compliant operations.

    - Data-backed confidence: remaining useful life estimates, spares forecasts,
    and audit-ready history.
  failure: >-
    - Continued surprise failures, lost production, and costly rush repairs and
    overtime.

    - Energy waste from degraded operation and higher emissions per ton.

    - Increased safety and compliance risk; eroding morale and customer trust.
