  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection of cartridge components is inconsistent, slow,
      and prone to misses, leading to customer returns and safety/compliance
      risks.
    - >-
      Rule-based machine vision systems require extensive tuning per
      SKU/lighting change and struggle with variable surface finishes (e.g.,
      annealing marks, lacquer, wash lines), causing high false-reject rates and
      downtime.
    - >-
      Dimensional checks (e.g., case length, primer depth, COAL) are often
      sample-based and off-line, leaving blind spots for in-process drift and
      mixed-lot contamination.
    - >-
      Lack of traceability and auditable acceptance decisions creates compliance
      risk with ISO 9001/AS9100 quality systems, SAAMI/C.I.P. specs, and defense
      contract requirements.
    - >-
      New SKU introductions and lot-to-lot variability require long setup times
      and expert vision engineers that are scarce within ammo factories.
    - >-
      Upstream variability (brass, projectiles, primers) increases defect rates;
      without automated sorting, good product is reworked and true defects
      escape.
    - >-
      Quality issues detected late (at final pack or in the field) are
      expensive: scrap, rework, chargebacks, and reputational damage.
    - >-
      Existing vision hardware vendors provide generic tools; plants need
      ammunition-specific defect taxonomies, metrics (PPM by defect class), and
      integrations to MES/PLC/SPC for real-time control.
  solution:
    - >-
      Provide an AI inspection service that accepts uploaded images/video for
      rapid trials/offline analysis and an on-prem/edge appliance for real-time
      inline inspection at production speeds.
    - >-
      Pre-trained ammunition models (cases, projectiles, primers) fine-tuned
      with customer data to detect dents, splits, crush, folds, burrs,
      plating/lacquer defects, headstamp defects, primer seating anomalies,
      projectile tilt/pull-out, sealant smears, etc.
    - >-
      Calibrated 2D/3D vision workflows to estimate key dimensions from images
      (e.g., case length, mouth out-of-round, rim thickness, primer depth/tilt)
      with MSA support and automatic calibration routines.
    - >-
      Acceptance Criteria Engine: encode SAAMI/C.I.P./customer-specific
      tolerance windows and cosmetic standards; per-defect-class severity rules
      and auto-disposition (accept/reject/rework/bin).
    - >-
      SPC + Feedback Control: send defect counts and dimensions to SPC; push
      alerts to PLC/MES when trends exceed control limits to trigger tool
      changes or parameter tweaks.
    - >-
      Traceability and Audit: per-part decision logs, images, model versioning,
      and operator annotations tied to lot/line/SKU; ITAR/EAR-aware data
      handling with on-prem or GovCloud options.
    - >-
      Integration SDK and connectors for common cameras (Basler, FLIR, IDS),
      PLCs (Rockwell, Siemens), MES/SCADA (Ignition, Sepasoft, SAP ME), and data
      lakes.
    - >-
      Operator UX: simple pass/fail UI, live overlays, defect heatmaps, quick
      threshold tweaks with permissions, and one-click golden sample updates.
    - >-
      Changeover Toolkit: recipe management per caliber/SKU with automatic
      lighting/exposure tuning and model selection; target changeover <60
      minutes without a vision PhD.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Ammunition-specific AI visual inspection that plugs into your existing
    cameras and lines to deliver 100% inspection for cosmetic and dimensional
    anomalies, configurable to your acceptance criteria, with auditable
    decisions, SPC feedback, and rapid SKU changeovers—cutting scrap and escapes
    while improving OEE within weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammunition-specific datasets and pretrained models with proven defect recall

    Quality and production leaders at small‑arms ammunition plants who need
    reliable, scalable, documented inspection of cases, projectiles, and
    primers.
  problem: >-
    Manual visual checks are slow and inconsistent, miss subtle
    cosmetic/dimensional defects, create bottlenecks, and risk escapes that lead
    to rework, recalls, safety concerns, and weak audit trails.

    Start a 2‑week pilot with your parts: book a 30‑minute demo and upload a
    sample set and criteria.
  success: >-
    Achieve 100% inspection coverage, consistent quality, reduced scrap, faster
    release, and lot‑level traceability that supports compliance and customer
    confidence.
  failure: >-
