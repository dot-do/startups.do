  problem:
    - >-
      Shoe retailers lose revenue when 10–30% of SKUs are disapproved or limited
      in Google Merchant Center (GMC) due to missing GTINs, policy violations,
      or image/price mismatches.
    - >-
      Manual feed QA is time-consuming (5–20 hrs/week per 10k SKUs) and
      error-prone, delaying reactivation and shrinking impression share.
    - >-
      Generic feed tools are rules-based and do not read/act on live GMC
      Diagnostics, leaving gaps between detection and resolution.
    - >-
      Footwear-specific data complexity (sizes, gender, color, variants,
      seasonal drops) increases title and attribute errors, compressing CTR and
      conversion.
    - >-
      Retailers struggle to keep up with Google policy changes (e.g., image
      overlays, inaccurate availability), leading to repeat suspensions and
      wasted ad spend.
  solution:
    - >-
      Directly ingest GMC Diagnostics and Alerts via API and webhooks; detect
      disapprovals/limitations within 5 minutes (MTTD).
    - >-
      Auto-fix common issues using footwear-tuned rules + AI: normalize titles
      (Brand + Model + Gender + Size + Color), fill missing variant attributes,
      validate availability/price, and enrich GTINs via catalog lookups.
    - >-
      Run image QA (background, size, text overlays, watermarks) and auto-swap
      to compliant images or request retakes via workflow.
    - >-
      Resubmit corrected items through Content API with audit trail, rollback,
      and versioning; escalate to human-in-the-loop when confidence <0.8.
    - >-
      Continuously A/B test title/attribute variants to improve CTR and query
      matching for product_type taxonomy.
    - >-
      Weekly feed health reports with revenue-at-risk calculations and policy
      change briefings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on GMC diagnostics agent for footwear that auto-fixes 80%+ of feed
    issues within 15 minutes, reduces disapprovals to <2%, and lifts Shopping
    CTR 5–15% via title/attribute optimization—without adding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization: proprietary footwear GTIN/brand-model mappings and
    size normalization rules, trained on multi-retailer outcomes. Closed-loop
    learning from GMC results improves fix precision over time. End-to-end
    autonomy (diagnose → fix → resubmit) reduces latency vs. rule-only feed
    tools. Fast SLAs and safety guardrails (confidence thresholds +
    audit/rollback) de-risk automation.
