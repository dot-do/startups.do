leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Regulatory change volume and complexity are increasing across
      jurisdictions (EU REACH/CLP, UK REACH, TSCA, CEPA, AICIS, K-REACH, KKDIK,
      CSCL, MEE China, GHS variants), overwhelming small regulatory teams.
    - >-
      Manual monitoring of regulatory updates and mapping to CAS/product
      portfolios is time-consuming (often 10–20 hours/week/analyst) and
      error-prone, leading to late actions and compliance gaps.
    - >-
      Lack of clear prioritization (what to do, by when, for which
      SKU/site/market) causes missed deadlines, emergency reformulations, halted
      shipments, or costly withdrawals.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (ERP, SDS authoring, PLM, LIMS) and supplier
      documentation gaps make it hard to cascade changes to BOMs, labels, SDS,
      and registrations.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks forward-looking visibility of regulatory risk to revenue
      (e.g., PFAS restrictions), making it difficult to plan portfolio strategy
      and inventory risk mitigation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Regulatory Change Radar: Continuous ingestion of official sources; NLP
      extraction of substance lists, thresholds, effective dates, obligations,
      and impacted jurisdictions.
    - >-
      Portfolio Mapping Engine: Synonym- and ID-aware linker maps regulations to
      CAS/EC/REACH numbers, mixtures, and site SKUs; handles concentration
      thresholds and GHS/CLP classes.
    - >-
      Impact Matrix: Risk scoring by severity, likelihood, affected
      revenue/SKUs, compliance deadlines; shows who must act (Reg, QA, Ops) and
      by when.
    - >-
      Action Playbooks: Jurisdiction-specific steps (e.g., TSCA PMN/SNUR
      screening, ECHA notifications, SDS/label updates, SCIP/Poison Centre
      submissions) with checklists and evidence templates.
    - >-
      Scenario & Watchlists: Simulate proposed rules (e.g., PFAS, microplastics)
      against portfolio to estimate revenue-at-risk and data needs.
    - >-
      Workflow & Audit Trail: Assign owners, due dates, approvals; generate
      auditor-ready evidence packs and management reports.
    - >-
      Integrations: APIs/connectors to SAP S/4HANA Product Compliance/EH&S,
      Oracle, Sphera, Enablon, Cority, UL WERCS, Lisam, 3E, PLM/LIMS; CSV/SFTP
      for lightweight setups.
    - >-
      Supplier Engagement: Automated requests for updated declarations/CoAs when
      rules impact components; track response SLAs and non-responder risk.
    - >-
      Localization & Explainability: Machine translations with human-in-the-loop
      summaries; citations to official texts and change diffs for defensible
      decisions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on AI that translates global regulatory change into a prioritized,
    auditable action plan for your exact CAS/product portfolio—cutting
    monitoring time by 60–80%, reducing late-compliance risk, and protecting
    revenue with weeks of advance notice.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned chemical regulatory knowledge graph that links multi-lingual
    synonyms, CAS/EC identifiers, group definitions, and concentration
    thresholds to specific SKUs/BOMs—combined with human-in-the-loop expert
    validation and prebuilt Action Playbooks per jurisdiction. This yields
    faster, more accurate, and auditable impact assessments than generic news
    monitors or static list-checkers.
