leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-cost, low-yield exploration: Gold/silver drill programs often exceed
      $100–$300 per meter with <10% drill holes intercepting economic
      mineralization.
    - >-
      Data overload and fragmentation: Satellite, geophysical, geologic, and
      geochemical datasets sit in silos; target generation is manual and
      subjective.
    - >-
      Slow targeting cycles: 3–9 months to compile data, build a GIS, and
      generate a rank-ordered target list; seasonality compresses field windows.
    - >-
      Uneven data quality: Varying resolutions, cloud cover, inconsistent
      geochem assays, and differing coordinate systems degrade model
      reliability.
    - >-
      Pressure to reduce surface disturbance/ESG impact: Need to narrow
      footprints and show data-driven rationale for work permits and engagement.
    - >-
      Talent shortage: Senior structural geologists and GIS modelers are scarce
      and expensive; juniors need decision support.
    - >-
      Inconsistent decision trail: Boards and investors want transparent,
      auditable rationale compliant with NI 43‑101/JORC for exploration
      targeting (without implying resource/reserve).
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion and harmonization of multi-sensor remote sensing,
      public geoscience, and client geochem/geophysics into a unified spatial
      data cube.
    - >-
      Prospectivity modeling using explainable ML that outputs a ranked target
      list with confidence bands and key evidence layers (structure, alteration,
      geochem anomalies).
    - >-
      Economic and access filters overlay (land status, protected areas,
      infrastructure, slope/elevation) to prioritize drill-ready, permitted
      targets.
    - >-
      Drill-collar suggestion and lineament-aligned targeting zones with
      uncertainty ellipses; export to ArcGIS/MapInfo/QGIS.
    - >-
      Continuous model updates as new assays or field mapping arrive; alerting
      when target ranking shifts materially.
    - >-
      Validation loop: back-testing against known deposits and blind tests;
      optional rapid field validation via partner geologists.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce exploration time and cost by ranking the highest-probability
    gold/silver targets through explainable fusion of satellite, geologic,
    geophysical, and geochemical evidence—cutting areas of interest by 70–90%
    and doubling anomaly hit rates within 6–8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary training corpus of gold/silver targets and outcomes
    (including negative results) fused with multi-sensor remote sensing and
    geochem, enabling deposit-style-specific models with transfer learning, plus
    strong explainability that fits NI 43‑101/JORC decision support. Early
    partnerships with imagery providers and labs create data-network effects and
    defensibility.

  character: >-
    Exploration VPs, geoscience leads, and project generators at gold and silver
    miners (NAICS 212220) who must decide where the next exploration dollar
    goes.
  problem: >-
    External: Exploration data is fragmented (satellite, geology, geochem),
    noisy, and slow to interpret.

    Internal: Teams lack confidence in which prospects deserve drilling and how
    to justify that choice.

    Philosophical: Capital should follow the best-evidenced targets, not the
    loudest opinions.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pressure of committing scarce meters under tight
    seasons, budgets, and board scrutiny.

    Authority: Our team blends remote sensing, structural geology, and machine
    learning to fuse satellite, geologic, and geochemical evidence into
    explainable target rankings used by exploration teams.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Ingest and fuse your AOI with public datasets to build evidential layers
    (alteration, structure, lithology).

    2) Rank targets with explainable AI; deliver maps, scores, and traceable
    evidence.

    3) Validate in the field, iterate, and focus meters on the
    highest-probability targets.

    Agreement plan:

    - Private workspace; your data stays your data.

    - Transparent features and weights; every score is auditable.

    - Start with a low-risk pilot on one district before scaling.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct CTA: Schedule a 30-minute discovery call and submit an AOI to receive
    a ranked target list and evidence maps.

    Transitional CTA: Request a sample report for a known district and a demo of
    the explainability dashboard.
  success: >-
    A defendable, prioritized target pipeline; higher probability of discovery
    per meter drilled; faster path to resource definition; reduced spend on
    low-likelihood holes; and audit-ready rationale for investment committees
    and partners.
  failure: >-
    Budgets spread thin over low-probability prospects, missed concealed
    deposits, avoidable dry holes, and competitors securing the best ground
    first.
