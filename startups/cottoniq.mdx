  problem:
    - >-
      Timing and rate uncertainty: Cotton N and K demand shifts quickly with
      growth stage and weather; mistimed topdress or over/under rates reduce
      lint yield and quality (e.g., leaf burn, rank growth, boll shed).
    - >-
      Fragmented data: Soil and tissue lab reports arrive as PDFs/CSVs with
      inconsistent ranges and units; growers and advisors spend 30–60 minutes
      per sample normalizing and interpreting results.
    - >-
      Static thresholds: Many interpretations use fixed sufficiency ranges that
      ignore phenology, temperature/soil moisture, and field vigor variation,
      leading to generic recommendations.
    - >-
      Operational friction: Turning insights into variable-rate prescriptions
      (VRA) requires GIS skills and format conversions (shapefile/ISOXML),
      delaying action by days during critical windows.
    - >-
      Economic pressure and risk: Fertilizer prices and application passes are
      costly; growers need proof that in-season N/K spending is ROI-positive
      while managing environmental scrutiny and N loss risks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated parsing and normalization of soil and tissue reports from major
      labs (OCR + API), mapping results to standardized units and
      phenology-adjusted sufficiency curves.
    - >-
      Growth stage engine that blends planting date, heat units, NDVI/NDRE
      trends, and scouting inputs to estimate NAWF/stage and expected N/K uptake
      trajectory.
    - >-
      Recommendation engine that generates in-season N and K rates and timing by
      zone, accounting for yield goal, soil texture/CEC, residual N/K,
      irrigation/rain forecast, and operational constraints.
    - >-
      VRA outputs in shapefile, ISOXML, and John Deere/Trimble/Ag Leader
      formats; zone creation ties to persistent management zones or on-the-fly
      vigor zones.
    - >-
      Alerting and what-if tools: “Apply in next 72 hours” notifications;
      simulate rate changes on predicted yield and cost.
    - >-
      Program analytics: Track applied vs recommended, yield response by zone, N
      use efficiency (lb lint per lb N), fiber quality impacts, and
      season-over-season benchmarks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, field-specific N and K recommendations that fuse lab results,
    satellite/drone imagery, weather, and cotton growth stage—delivered in
    hours, not days—with one-click variable-rate prescriptions and measurable
    ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Cotton growers and agronomists (NAICS 111920) seeking precise, in-season
    nitrogen and potassium management to maximize lint yield and ROI while
    protecting soil and water.
  problem: >-
    They juggle soil and tissue lab PDFs, imagery, and growth-stage notes
    without a unified interpretation, making N/K timing unclear—leading to
    guesswork, wasted inputs, and yield risk. They feel rushed and uncertain,
    and believe growers shouldn’t have to gamble with plant nutrition.
  guide: >-
    We understand the narrow windows for N/K in cotton. Our AI, built on cotton
    agronomy and calibrated to your labs and imagery, interprets reports and
    growth stage to deliver clear, field-ready prescriptions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect lab accounts or upload reports and link imagery; set crop and
    growth stage. 2) The AI fuses data to recommend N and K rates, timing
    windows, and variable-rate zones. 3) Export prescriptions to
    equipment/retailer and receive in-season updates as new data arrives.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on two fields, or book a 15-minute demo and download a
    sample prescription.
  success: >-
    Apply the right rate at the right time, lift lint yield, cut N/K waste and
    passes, prevent hidden deficiencies, document 4R stewardship for buyers and
    programs, and make confident decisions all season.
  failure: >-
    Missed windows, over- or under-application, lost lint and profit, nutrient
    losses and compliance risk, extra passes, and constant second-guessing.

    title: Turn Lab Numbers into Winning N & K Decisions
    subtitle: >-
      AI interprets soil/tissue tests, imagery, and growth stage to deliver
      in-season nitrogen and potassium rates and timing for cotton.
    ctaText: Start Free Trial
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - 'Lab reports give numbers, not clear in-field actions.'
    - 'N and K needs shift fast with weather, growth stage, and soil variability.'
    - Late or mis-timed applications cut yield and fiber quality.
    - Over-application wastes cash and risks lodging or leaf burn.
    - Manual map-making and rate setting are slow during peak season.
  solution:
    - Parse soil/tissue lab reports and translate them into precise N & K recs.
    - >-
      Fuse satellite/drone imagery with growth stage to target hot spots and
      timing.
    - Auto-generate variable-rate prescriptions and simple flat-rate plans.
    - Flag deficiency risk early and suggest the next tissue test window.
    - Track outcomes and refine recommendations as new data arrives.
  features:
    - Auto-ingest lab PDFs/CSVs; unit normalization and QC checks.
    - NDVI/NDRE imagery fusion for spatial variability and trend detection.
    - Growth stage-aware engine that adjusts rates by phenology and heat units.
    - Field-specific N & K rate and timing with agronomic rationale.
    - 'Variable-rate Rx export (SHP, ISOXML) and printable task sheets.'
    - 'Economic view: cost per acre and marginal return estimate.'
    - Weather-aware timing windows and rain/irrigation fit suggestions.
    - Deficiency risk alerts and sampling reminders by zone.
    - Multi-field batch processing with saved templates and defaults.
    - 'Audit trail: what changed, why, and when—ready for advisor review.'
  steps:
    - Upload or email your soil/tissue lab reports.
    - Select field boundaries and connect imagery (or use built-in satellite).
    - Confirm current growth stage (or let the model estimate).
    - 'Review recommended N & K rates, timing windows, and rationale.'
    - Export VRA prescriptions or download flat-rate guidance.
    - 'Apply, monitor imagery, and sync new tissue results.'
    - Repeat mid-season to stay on target and protect yield.
