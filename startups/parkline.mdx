  problem:
    - >-
      RV parks and campgrounds miss 20–50% of calls during peak/after-hours,
      losing bookings and frustrating guests.
    - >-
      Staff spend 3–5 minutes per call answering repetitive questions (site
      size, hookups, pet policy) instead of on-site operations.
    - >-
      High rate of unqualified inquiries (rig too long, wrong amperage,
      slide-outs, toad) leads to misbookings and last-minute cancellations.
    - >-
      No consistent 24/7 coverage; owners juggle personal phones, resulting in
      burnout and poor guest experience.
    - >-
      Legacy answering services can’t check live availability, take payment, or
      modify/cancel in the park’s PMS.
    - >-
      Inconsistent communication of rules, deposits, and cancellation policies
      causes disputes and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into call drivers and conversion metrics; decisions are
      made without data.
    - >-
      Seasonal demand spikes overwhelm front desks; hiring/training temporary
      staff is costly and time-consuming.

      sub-2 second response time.

      automatic confirmation and pre-arrival messages.
    - >-
      Policy-aware conversations: deposits, cancellation windows, quiet hours,
      pet rules, amenity schedules, weather/fire restrictions.
    - >-
      After-hours coverage and overflow handling during peak; intelligent warm
      transfer to staff for edge cases.
    - >-
      Upsell engine for add-ons (early check-in, extra vehicle, firewood,
      propane, golf cart, premium Wi-Fi) and longer-stay offers.

      conversion, missed-call recapture), and knowledge base controls.
