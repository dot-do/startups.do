  problem:
    - >-
      Static, once-a-year price lists miss seasonal and event-driven demand
      swings, leading to 5–15% revenue left on the table.
    - >-
      Branch managers price by gut and competitor gossip, not data;
      cross-location price inconsistencies cause margin leakage and customer
      confusion.
    - >-
      Minimum rental periods (4-hr vs day vs weekend) aren’t tuned to demand
      patterns, reducing booking conversion and asset utilization.
    - >-
      No simple way to test pricing safely; lack of guardrails and A/B testing
      prevents learning and rapid iteration.
    - >-
      RMS reports are backward-looking; they don’t forecast future demand by
      SKU/location or recommend actionable price updates.
    - >-
      Regional demand drivers (weather, holidays, local events, construction
      seasonality) are not integrated into pricing decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration with RMS to ingest 24–36 months of rental history, price
      tables, discounts, availability, and calendars by location/SKU.
    - >-
      Demand forecasting per SKU/location/day (52-week horizon) using
      seasonality, weather, holidays, local events, and macro signals.
    - >-
      Price and minimum-rental optimizer that respects brand guardrails
      (floors/ceilings, margin targets, competitor sensitivity) and outputs
      publish-ready price tables.
    - >-
      A/B testing and rollout controls: test subsets of SKUs/locations, measure
      conversion/utilization impact, and auto-promote winning strategies.
    - >-
      Capacity/utilization recommendations: inter-branch transfers, fleet
      right-sizing (buy/sell), and weekend/holiday pricing calendars to reduce
      stockouts and idle time.
    - >-
      Explainable recommendations with “why” (e.g., weather shift, event spike,
      historical elasticity) and one-click approve/publish back to RMS and
      website.
    - >-
      Impact dashboard: revenue lift, utilization, stockouts, forecast accuracy
      (MAPE), booking conversion, and price realization with ROI calculations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase rental revenue 5–12% and improve dollar/time utilization within 90
    days through explainable, guardrailed AI that forecasts demand and
    automatically recommends price and minimum-rental adjustments—integrated
    directly into your RMS with manager control and clear ROI attribution.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, privacy-preserving cross-client rental demand and elasticity
    dataset tied to SKU categories and local demand drivers, plus deep RMS
    integrations and explainable guardrails purpose-built for rental
    (minimum-period dynamics, weekend/holiday calendars). This combination
    creates defensible accuracy, faster time-to-value, and trust that generic
    pricing vendors and RMS reporting modules lack.
  customerSegments:

    - >-
      Secondary: Independent single-location rental shops looking to
      professionalize pricing without hiring a data team.
    - >-

      seeking category-specific uplift or pilot regions; OEM dealer-run rental
      programs; big-box tool rental networks.

      retargeting with pilot offer; email sequences offering a free diagnostic
      using 12 months of historical data.

      SKUs with explicit success criteria and gain-share option.
  revenueStreams:
    - >-
      Subscription: $1,200 per location per month (includes up to 2,000 active
