leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Roof/strata falls remain a top safety and production risk in underground
      coal; existing monitoring often provides descriptive alarms, not
      predictive risk scoring.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across convergence meters, microseismic arrays, and support
      load sensors, making manual integration slow and inconsistent across
      shifts.
    - >-
      High false-alarm rates erode trust and lead to alarm fatigue; conversely,
      missed precursors result in costly unplanned stoppages and incidents.
    - >-
      Limited and variable underground connectivity complicates reliable
      real-time analytics and alerting at the face and in the control room.
    - >-
      Compliance reporting (MSHA/State regulators/insurers) is manual and
      retrospective, consuming engineering time without improving prevention.
    - >-
      Site-to-site geology and support practices vary, making it difficult to
      transfer rules or thresholds; mines need adaptive, site-calibrated models.
    - >-
      Proving ROI for new safety tech is difficult without quantified links to
      reduced downtime and incident likelihood.
    - >-
      Integrating with OEM hardware and mine IT/OT (OPC UA, Modbus/TCP,
      historian systems) is non-trivial and can delay deployments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data fusion layer that ingests convergence, microseismic/acoustic,
      and support load data (plus operational context like face advance rate)
      and harmonizes timestamps/locations.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models trained on multi-mine, multi-panel datasets to
      predict elevated roof fall risk with calibrated probabilities and
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Tiered alerting (advisory/amber/red) with clear precursors (e.g.,
      acceleration in convergence rate, event energy clustering, rising bolt
      load variance) and expected lead time.
    - >-
      Edge/on-prem analytics for low-latency processing underground or on
      surface servers; cloud sync for fleet-level analytics, benchmarking, and
      updates.
    - >-
      Operator-facing dashboards for control room and geotech engineer
      workflows, with map overlays, panel/roadway timelines, and shift reports.
    - >-
      Automated compliance and post-event forensics reporting; model
      explainability (feature contributions) to support engineering decisions.
    - >-
      Open APIs and connectors to mine OT/IT (OPC UA, Modbus/TCP, REST) and
      major historians; sensor-agnostic drivers for common OEMs.
    - >-
      Structured pilot program and site calibration toolkit to set baselines,
      thresholds, and success criteria within 6–12 weeks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Physics-informed, multi-sensor AI that fuses convergence, microseismic, and
    support load data to deliver early, trustworthy roof fall risk alerts with
    explainability—reducing unplanned downtime and improving safety while
    fitting into existing mine sensors and networks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-mine, multi-sensor labeled dataset combined with physics-informed
    models and OEM integrations yields higher predictive power and lower
    false-alarm rates than single-sensor or rules-based systems. Edge-capable,
    low-latency analytics and regulator-ready reporting further raise switching
    costs once deployed.

    Underground coal mine managers, superintendents, and ground-control
    engineers who must keep crews safe and production on plan.
  problem: >-
    External: Disparate convergence, microseismic, and support data hide early
    roof-fall risk; responses are reactive and costly. Internal: Fear of missing
    weak signals and endangering crews. Philosophical: No one should be
    blindsided by preventable roof failures.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pressure of stopping collapses with incomplete, noisy
    signals and tight schedules. Authority: Built by geotechnical engineers and
    data scientists; field-proven pilots in underground coal; secure,
    interoperable, auditable analytics.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Site assessment and data audit; 2) Connect convergence,
    microseismic, and support feeds; 3) Calibrate models to your geology and
    support regime; 4) Activate real-time risk scores and alerts; 5) Weekly
    hazard reviews. Agreement: 90-day pilot, clear alert protocol, your data
    stays yours.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and start a 90-day pilot. Transitional: Request a
    baseline risk report and case study.
  success: >-
    See roof/strata risk earlier, target support proactively, help reduce
    incidents and downtime, document compliance, and make confident shift
    decisions with a single dashboard and measurable ROI.
  failure: >-
    Missed signals lead to a roof fall, injuries, shutdowns, emergency rehab
    costs, regulatory scrutiny, and loss of trust with crews and stakeholders.
