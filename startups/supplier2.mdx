leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Corn and resin volatility creates 5–15% quarterly swings in ingredient and
      packaging costs, but most tortilla manufacturers award to 1–2 suppliers on
      annual cycles without structured split/timing optimization.
    - >-
      Lack of consolidated internal/external data (supplier scorecards, OTIF,
      COAs, ERPs, CME corn futures, resin indices, FX USD/MXN, freight) prevents
      data-driven award decisions.
    - >-
      Overreliance on single-source masa or film suppliers increases disruption
      risk from weather, capacity outages, recalls, or transportation
      constraints.
    - >-
      Procurement teams spend excessive time (10–20 hrs/week per buyer) on
      manual data prep for bids, and still miss early warning signals (basis
      changes, WASDE revisions, MX harvest conditions).
    - >-
      Contracts often lack index-linkage and optimal volume tiers; organizations
      pay price variance premia of 1–3% and miss early-buy windows.
    - >-
      Limited forward coverage discipline leads to stockouts or high-cost spot
      buys; service-level penalties cascade to major retail/foodservice
      customers.
    - >-
      Plant-level variability (yields, scrap, run-rates) isn’t reflected in
      sourcing; suppliers are not allocated based on plant constraints, MOQ,
      capacity, or logistics lanes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate internal data (ERP/AP, POs, receipts, supplier scorecards,
      quality/COA, OTIF, plant usage) with external signals (CME corn futures &
      basis, USDA/WASDE, MX crop/FX USD–MXN, resin indices like HDPE/LDPE,
      paperboard, freight/energy).
    - >-
      Forecast price paths and risk bands (P10/P50/P90) for corn, masa, resin,
      and paper with 1–9 month horizons; convert to expected cost per SKU per
      plant.
    - >-
      Optimize split awards: allocate volumes across qualified suppliers to
      minimize expected total cost + risk penalty subject to constraints
      (capacity, MOQs, service levels, quality scores, logistics lanes).
    - >-
      Recommend buy timing and forward coverage ladder (e.g., 3/6/9-month
      tranches) to lock value when prices fall within target bands; simulate
      impact on COGS and cash flow.
    - >-
      Design index-linked contracts with volume tiers and floors/ceilings;
      validate clauses against historical data to quantify variance reduction.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if shocks (yield loss, port delay, supplier
      outage) with Monte Carlo to identify resilient allocations and safety
      stock.
    - >-
      Alerts and workflows: early warnings on basis widening, FX swings, resin
      outages, and supplier performance drift; surface actionable award/timing
      tasks to buyers.
    - >-
      Audit-ready reporting to measure realized savings, forecast error,
      contract coverage, and service-level improvements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut COGS 2–5% and reduce supply disruption risk by algorithmically
    recommending optimal split awards and buy timing across corn/masa and
    packaging, using supplier performance, market indices, and plant-level
    constraints—implemented in weeks and measurable on your P&L.

    plant uptime.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile corn and freight markets; supplier performance
    variability; tight lead times/MOQs; fragmented data; hard volume/contract
    commitments.

    - Internal: Pressure to hit COGS and service targets; uncertainty on optimal
    split awards and buy timing; spreadsheet fatigue and slow decisions.

    - Philosophical: Buying staple inputs shouldn’t feel like gambling with
    cost, quality, or uptime.

    integrates supplier scorecards, market indices, and commitments to recommend
    optimal split awards and timing. Proven in pilots to reduce total landed
    cost and stockout risk while improving supplier performance.
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan: 1) Connect ERP/MRP, contracts, and supplier scorecards. 2)
    Set risk, service, and budget targets. 3) Receive AI recommendations for
    split awards and buy windows. 4) Run guided bids and issue award letters. 5)
    Monitor KPIs and re-optimize monthly.

    - Agreement Plan: SOC 2–aligned data handling; keep your systems and
    approvals; start with one category; cancel anytime.

    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 2-week pilot in
    corn/masa/packaging.

    - Transitional: Download the category playbook and benchmark your current
    split-award strategy.
  success: >-
    Lower and more predictable COGS; optimized split awards and purchase timing;
    fewer expedites and line stops; captured rebates and freight efficiencies;
    stronger supplier partnerships; auditable, data-backed decisions; clear risk
    visibility in S&OP.
