  title: Material Nesting and NC Program Prep
  description: >-
    Optimize sheet/plate nests and prepare machine-ready NC files with remnant
    usage recommendations.
  targetUsers:
    - CAM Programmers
    - Machine Operators
    - Production Planners
  triggers:
    - Parts list released to CAM
    - New remnant added to inventory
  inputs:
    - DXF/STEP flat patterns
    - Material grade/thickness; kerf/lead-in/out rules
    - Stock sizes and remnant catalog
    - Machine type/post (laser/plasma/oxy-fuel)
  steps:
    - Import and clean geometry; map layers/features
    - Auto-nest parts across sheets and remnants for utilization/priority
    - Simulate cut paths; estimate pierces/cut time
    - Generate NC via post-processor; export nests and labels
    - Flag contour issues for human check
  tools:
    - CAD kernel (OpenCascade)
    - Nesting solver (DeepNest CLI/NestLib)
    - Post-processing via vendor posts or RPA
    - Time estimator (heuristics)
  outputs:
    - Nested DXF/PNG with utilization
    - NC code files (.ESSI/.MNC/.Gcode)
    - Time and pierce estimates
    - Remnant usage report
  pricingModel:
    - Per-nest/per-sheet fee
    - Monthly unlimited with fair use
    - One-time setup for posts and rules
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 3.5
    modelCapability: 3
    overall: 3.5
  risks:
    - Machine-specific quirks not captured in posts
    - Liability for scrap if parameters wrong
    - Inconsistent CAD layer conventions
  dependencies:
    - Post processors and machine parameters
    - Remnant database accuracy
    - 'Shop rules for micro-joints, tabs, etch/marking'

  problem:
    - >-
      Material waste: Typical plate shops average 75–85% nest yield; 2–7% of
      material value is lost due to suboptimal nesting and remnant underuse.
    - >-
      Programmer time sink: 1–3 hours per job for manual nesting, lead-in/out,
      common-line checks, and post-processing, creating bottlenecks and schedule
      risk.
    - >-
      Inconsistent remnant tracking: Remnants are poorly cataloged; usable
      offcuts go unutilized, leading to unnecessary new sheet pulls and higher
      inventory carrying costs.
    - >-
      NC errors and rework: Incorrect post settings (kerf, pierce height, THC,
      bevel angles) and controller quirks lead to scrap, recuts, and machine
      downtime.
    - >-
      Pierce and cut inefficiency: Excess pierces and non-optimized toolpaths
      increase consumable spend, cut time, and heat distortion risk.
    - >-
      Fragmented data flow: CAD/BOM → nesting → NC → ERP/MES lacks closed-loop
      feedback; actual cut performance is not used to improve future nests.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven auto-nesting that learns from past jobs and actual cut outcomes
      to maximize yield and reduce pierces/cut length.
    - >-
      Automated NC program preparation with controller-specific post processors
      (e.g., Hypertherm EDGE Connect, ESAB Vision, Messer Global Control, Burny,
      Siemens 840D, Fanuc for laser/waterjet) and machine capability
      constraints.
    - >-
      Remnant intelligence: detect, generate, label, and recommend remnant use;
      maintain a live remnant inventory with geometry, thickness, grade, and
      location.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware nesting: grain direction, heat zones, bevel, part
      priority, common-line/chain cutting, micro-tabs, lead-in/out libraries,
      torch collision clearance.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optimization: ingest cut logs (pierce time, cut speed, arc
      voltage, consumable life) to adapt toolpaths and parameters per
      machine/material.
    - >-
      Lightweight integrations: CAD/DXF/DWG/STEP import, ERP/MES (Epicor,
      JobBOSS2, ProShop, NetSuite, Odoo) connectors, barcode/QR for remnant
      tagging, edge agent for on-prem file drops.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase material yield by 3–8%, cut time by 5–15%, and release
    machine-ready NC in minutes—not hours—while automatically tracking and
    reusing remnants. Guaranteed ROI within 90 days or cancel anytime.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, per-machine learning from real cut data and consumable states
    across a diverse fleet, producing parameter and path strategies that
    outperform rule-based nesting. Over time, the anonymized outcomes dataset
    and validated post library create a compounding advantage difficult for new
    entrants to replicate.
