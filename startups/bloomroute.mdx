  problem:
    - >-
      Florists spend 1–3 hours daily manually planning routes (spreadsheets,
      Google Maps), causing delays and errors, especially on peak days
      (Valentine’s, Mother’s Day).
    - >-
      Missed time windows (funerals, business hours) and inaccurate ETAs create
      customer complaints, refunds, and negative reviews.
    - >-
      Drivers lack clear manifests and optimized sequences, reducing stops per
      hour and increasing miles driven and overtime costs.
    - >-
      Address quality issues (apartment numbers, funeral home names vs recipient
      names) lead to failed deliveries and reattempts.
    - >-
      No automated, compliant ETA SMS updates; shops call or text manually,
      consuming staff time and creating inconsistent customer experience.
    - >-
      Existing route tools are generic; they don’t integrate with florist
      POS/wire systems or handle florist-specific constraints (card handling,
      cooler staging, multi-drop to hospitals/funeral homes).
    - >-
      Seasonal surges overwhelm teams; temporary drivers need simple, foolproof
      tools and paper fallback manifests.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven route optimization tuned for florist workflows
      (funerals/hospitals time windows, cooler staging, driver shifts, vehicle
      capacity).
    - >-
      Automated ETA SMS and delivery confirmations with compliant opt-out;
      two-way messaging to handle access codes/leave-at-door permissions.
    - >-
      Driver manifests (mobile and printable) with clear sequence, turn-by-turn
      links, item counts, recipient/contact, and special instructions.
    - >-
      One-click import from florist POS/wire systems with address cleanup and
      de-duplication (e.g., multiple deliveries to the same funeral home).
    - >-
      Peak-day “Valentine’s Mode”: batching, wave planning, temporary driver
      onboarding, and extended live support.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: on-time rate, ETA accuracy, stops per hour, miles per
      stop, reschedules/failed deliveries.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Florist-first routing and ETA SMS that cuts planning time by 70%, increases
    stops per driver by 20–30%, and hits >95% on-time delivery—even on
    Valentine’s Day—through AI optimization, florist-specific constraints, POS
    integrations, and automated, branded ETA texts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Florist-specific routing intelligence (e.g., funeral/hospital directory time
    windows, multi-drop heuristics, peak-day batching) combined with deep POS
    integrations and holiday surge playbooks—backed by proprietary performance
    data that continually improves ETA accuracy and route density for florists.
