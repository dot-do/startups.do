leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Climate variability makes local nectar flows increasingly unpredictable;
      many flows now start 1–3 weeks earlier/later than historical norms,
      causing mistimed supering and splits.
    - >-
      Mistimed supering or splits result in missed honey yields (often 10–30%
      loss), congestion-driven swarming, or wasted labor/equipment when expected
      flows don’t materialize.
    - >-
      Commercial and migratory operators lack a data-driven way to plan yard
      moves across regions; decisions rely on anecdote and coarse regional
      calendars.
    - >-
      Existing tools are reactive (hive scales detect flow after it begins) or
      too coarse (regional bloom calendars/weather apps), not predictive at the
      yard level.
    - >-
      Small and mid-sized operations lack resources to fuse weather, phenology,
      and satellite data into actionable management timing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse numerical weather forecasts, historical weather, satellite vegetation
      indices (NDVI/EVI), soil moisture, land cover, and phenology to predict
      nectar flow onset, peak, and end at 1–5 km resolution.
    - >-
      Calibrate models with ground-truth from hive scales and beekeeper-reported
      events; define a flow event as sustained hive weight gain (e.g., ≥1.0
      kg/day for ≥3 consecutive days) to produce labeled training data.
    - >-
      Deliver forecasts via web/mobile dashboards, SMS/push alerts, and an API;
      include confidence intervals and species-level bloom likelihood where
      available.
    - >-
      Provide prescriptive recommendations (e.g., add supers 3–5 days before
      likely onset; defer splits if dearth risk ≥60%; move yards during
      predicted lull) and scenario planning tools.
    - >-
      Continuously retrain models with fresh seasons and regional tuning;
      monitor model drift and performance by eco-region.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hyperlocal 3–21 day nectar flow forecasts with confidence scores and
    prescriptive actions that increase honey yield 10–20% and reduce swarming
    20–40% by timing supering, splits, and yard moves precisely.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, fast-growing ground-truth dataset from integrated hive scales
    and verified beekeeper logs enables region-specific calibration that
    competitors without device integrations cannot match. Combined with
    prescriptive management guidance co-developed with commercial beekeeper
    advisors, OEM partnerships, and first-mover focus on hyperlocal predictive
    nectar flow, this creates defensible performance and distribution
    advantages.

  character: >-
    Beekeepers (sideliners and commercial) who want to time supering, splits,
    and moves by yard—not by guesswork.
  problem: >-
    Nectar flows shift by microclimate and bloom timing, leaving beekeepers
    guessing—risking missed supers, swarms, and lost yield when hard work
    shouldn’t be wasted by uncertainty.
  guide: >-
    Nectar Flow Forecaster understands the stress of timing decisions; our AI
    blends local weather, phenology, and satellite vegetation indices to deliver
    clear, yard-level forecasts you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Add your yards (GPS or map), 2) Get 7–30 day nectar-flow forecasts and
    alerts, 3) Act—super, split, or move on the optimal dates.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free trial—add your yards and receive your first forecast and alert
    within minutes.
  success: >-
    You super and split at the right time, curb swarming and emergency feeding,
    boost honey yield, optimize labor and equipment, and run a calmer, more
    profitable apiary.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing, miss peak flows, over/under-super, trigger swarms, waste feed
    and miles, and watch revenue slip while colonies stress.

      Predict local nectar flows from weather, phenology, and satellite
      indices—so you super and split at the right time.
    ctaText: Forecast my flow
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - Nectar flows vary by microclimate; calendars miss local timing.
    - Mistimed supering leaves honey on the flowers.
    - Late splits increase swarming risk and queen loss.
    - Weather apps don’t translate to forage availability.
    - Hard to plan crews and migratory routes without flow timing.
    - 'Guesswork wastes feed, fuel, and labor.'
    - No easy way to compare flow timing year over year.
  solution:
    - Yard-level flow windows 1–4 weeks ahead.
    - 'AI blends weather, phenology, and satellite vegetation indices.'
    - Clear flow intensity score with confidence range.
    - Species-level bloom tracking for your forage mix.
    - 'Alerts before the window opens, peaks, and closes.'
