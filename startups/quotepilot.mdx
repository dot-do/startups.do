leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive via inboxes and industry portals (ILS, PartsBase, ShipServ,
      SAM.gov) and require manual parsing; typical quote turnaround is 4–24
      hours, hurting win rate on time-sensitive buys.
    - >-
      Pricing and lead-time rules are tribal and inconsistent; margin leakage of
      1–3 pts from over-discounting, stock-outs, or misapplied expedite fees is
      common.
    - >-
      20–35% of RFQs never receive a quote due to backlog or missing data;
      duplicate/irrelevant RFQs waste rep time.
    - >-
      CRM hygiene is poor: follow-ups are missed, attribution is incomplete, and
      insights into win/loss drivers are lacking.
    - >-
      Compliance and auditability (ITAR/EAR, export screenings, end-use/end-user
      checks) are manual and error-prone, increasing risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal RFQ ingestion: connectors for IMAP/O365/Gmail,
      ILS/PartsBase/ShipServ/SAM.gov, CSV/PDF parsing; de-duplication and spam
      filtering.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned parsing engine: LLM+rules extract part numbers, NSNs,
      quantities, conditions, buyer terms, Incoterms, and due dates with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Inventory and supplier sourcing: sync with ERP/warehouse; supplier catalog
      APIs; alternates/substitutes mapping via a parts knowledge graph.
    - >-
      Pricing and lead-time logic: rules+ML optimizer using cost, MOQ, currency,
      freight, historical win rates, expedite fees; margin guardrails by
      customer/region.
    - >-
      Quote generation and submission: branded PDFs, EDI/portal auto-submit,
      buyer-specific T&Cs; multi-currency/tax; BOM/kitting support.
    - >-
      Workflow and approvals: role-based thresholds; exception queue for
      low-confidence items or margin break; 2-click human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      CRM automation: auto-create opportunities/activities in
      Salesforce/HubSpot/AvSight; schedule cadenced follow-ups and reminders.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: export screening (denied parties, embargoed
      countries), ITAR/EAR flags, end-use attestations, and tamper-proof audit
      logs.
    - >-
      Analytics: quote speed, win rate by segment, margin uplift, follow-up
      effectiveness, buyer response time heatmaps; A/B test cadences.
    - >-
      Security and deployment: SOC 2 Type II roadmap, SSO/SAML, data residency
      options (US/EU), VPC single-tenant option for enterprise.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs into accurate, margin-optimized quotes in under 60 seconds with
    full audit trail, portal/email coverage, and automatic CRM
    follow-ups—improving win rate 10–25% and recovering 1–2 margin points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific RFQ corpus, connectors to niche industry systems, and a
    parts knowledge graph that improves match/alternate recommendations—combined
    with compliance-grade auditability—create high switching costs and
    defensibility versus generic CPQ/RPA tools.
