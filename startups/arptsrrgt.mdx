  problem:
    - >-
      Fan/blower and air-purification OEMs face 8–12 week design cycles per
      iteration due to CFD setup, meshing, and multipoint validation.
    - >-
      Prototyping and lab tests (AMCA 210/ISO 5801) are costly ($30k–$150k per
      build/test) and slow, limiting iteration speed and innovation.
    - >-
      Engineering teams struggle to jointly optimize efficiency, pressure rise,
      and noise (dB) under constraints (geometry envelopes, manufacturability,
      structural limits, motor curves).
    - >-
      CFD compute/licensing bottlenecks and limited optimization expertise
      prevent full-factor DOE and robust design exploration.
    - >-
      Generic optimization tools lack fan-specific parameterizations, acoustics
      integration, and AMCA/ISO correlation workflows, producing low trust and
      adoption.
    - >-
      Data/IP security concerns and complex CAD/CAE toolchains reduce
      willingness to externalize or automate workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Audit and scope: Collect duty points, constraints, CAD parameters, and
      target KPIs; define operating envelope and lab-test correlation targets.
    - >-

      (backward-curved/forward-curved/radial/axial impellers and scroll
      housings) with manufacturability rules.
    - >-
      DOE + active learning: Run 150–500 cloud CFD cases (RANS/URANS; optional
      LES for acoustics seeds) using Latin Hypercube + adaptive sampling to
      minimize runs.
    - >-
      Surrogate training: Fit Gaussian Processes/Polynomial
      Chaos/physics-informed NNs with uncertainty quantification; target ±2–3%
      error in pressure rise, ±1–2 percentage points in efficiency, ±1.5–2 dB in
      SPL at key operating points.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization: Use NSGA-II/gradient-enhanced methods to
      maximize efficiency and pressure rise while minimizing noise and mass;
      enforce constraints (geometry envelopes, stress, fan laws, motor curves).
    - >-
      Validation: Confirm top candidates with high-fidelity CFD; optional lab
      test (AMCA 210/ISO 5801, ISO 5136 duct acoustics) for correlation reports.
    - >-
      Handoff and deployment: Deliver CAD deltas, performance maps, surrogate
      model/API for reuse, and a validation dossier; integrate with customer
      PLM/CAE for ongoing use.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut design iteration time 50–80% and deliver 2–5 percentage-point efficiency
    gains and 1–3 dB noise reductions by training physics-informed surrogate
    models on cloud CFD and optimizing multi-objective performance under
    real-world constraints—validated to AMCA/ISO standards.
