leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Event-driven ridership spikes (sports, concerts, conventions) create
      overcrowding, long dwell times, missed trips, and safety risks when
      service uplift is under-planned.
    - >-
      Planning is manual and slow (spreadsheets, calls, emails), often finalized
      <48 hours before events, yielding suboptimal train lengths, headways, and
      bus bridging.
    - >-
      Agencies lack an integrated view of demand signals (ticket sales, venue
      calendars, social buzz, historical APC/AVM data, weather), reducing
      forecast accuracy.
    - >-
      Operational constraints (crew rules, HOS/union agreements, consist/rolling
      stock availability, turnback capacity, maintenance windows) are not
      systematically modeled.
    - >-
      Over- and under-provision are common: overspend on overtime and empty runs
      or suffer reputational damage from crowding and delays.
    - >-
      Passenger communications are fragmented and reactive; alerts are late or
      vague, reducing trust and uptake of public transit for events.
    - >-
      Hard to quantify ROI of special event uplift (cost per additional rider,
      revenue/cost recovery, crowding reduction), limiting budget approvals.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest external signals (venue calendars, ticketing sales pace, city
      permits, social media intensity, weather) and internal data (APC/AVM,
      historical ridership, GTFS/NeTEx, rolling stock/crew availability).
    - >-
      Forecast event-driven demand at station/stop and OD-pair level by
      15-minute intervals with uncertainty bands; target MAPE ≤15% for major
      events after calibration.
    - >-
      Optimize uplift using a constraint-based solver: propose extra trips,
      consist lengths, turnbacks, headway adjustments, and bus bridging that
      respect crew rules, rolling stock, track capacity, and maintenance
      windows.
    - >-
      Auto-validate crew/vehicle feasibility (hours-of-service, relief points)
      and generate draft rosters compatible with scheduling tools (HASTUS,
      Trapeze, Optibus).
    - >-
      Produce costed scenarios (overtime, fuel/energy, access charges) and
      benefit estimates (additional riders carried, crowding reduction, wait
      time saved) with ROI ranking.
    - >-
      Generate comms packages: GTFS/GTFS-RT/NeTEx updates, SIRI-SX alerts,
      stop/station signage scripts, website banners, social posts, and push
      notifications, with A/B templates.
    - >-
      Day-of-event monitoring and re-optimization using live APC/AVL and gate
      counts; issue micro-adjustments (short turns, trip inserts, platform
      staffing alerts).
    - >-
      Create a reusable playbook library by venue/type (e.g., soccer 60k, arena
      20k, parade route) with benchmark KPIs to accelerate future planning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that turns event signals into accurate demand forecasts and prescriptive,
    constraint-feasible uplift plans (extra trips, train length, headways,
    crew/vehicle rosters) plus ready-to-publish passenger comms—delivered in
    hours, not weeks—cutting crowding incidents up to 30% and reducing
    overtime/empty miles by 10–15%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-venue, cross-city event-demand dataset and calibrated models
    combined with a transit-specific, constraint-feasible optimization engine
    and deep integrations to leading scheduling and passenger info systems—plus
    a team of ex-operators and pre-qualified public-sector security/compliance
    posture—enable faster, more accurate, and truly actionable uplift plans than
    generic tools or manual methods.
