  problem:
    - >-
      Masters and dispatchers must synthesize marine weather, tides/currents,
      Local/Notices to Mariners (LNM/NtM), ice bulletins, and AIS traffic
      manually, consuming 20–60 minutes per sailing and leading to inconsistent
      decisions.
    - >-
      Nearshore weather on coasts and Great Lakes changes rapidly; missing a
      30–60 minute departure window can cascade into schedule delays, overtime,
      and missed connections.
    - >-
      Fuel burn is sensitive to sea state, current, and speed profile; operators
      lack an easy way to optimize for both punctuality and economy, leading to
      3–10% avoidable fuel cost.
    - >-
      Existing tools are siloed (ECS/ENC, weather viewers, AIS screens); few
      provide an integrated, route-specific risk score and auditable go/no-go
      rationale aligned to Safety Management Systems (SMS) and USCG/Transport
      Canada expectations.
    - >-
      Great Lakes and seasonal ice conditions, shoaling, dredging, and temporary
      restrictions are dynamic; operators struggle to maintain up-to-date
      constraints across crews and shifts.
    - >-
      Public agencies and insurers are increasing expectations for documented
      risk assessments; many operators lack a consistent, data-backed process
      and audit trail.
    - >-
      Unexpected congestion (bridge openings, harbor events, regattas) disrupts
      ETAs; dispatch lacks predictive insight to re-sequence departures or
      adjust speed proactively.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion engine that ingests NOAA/NWS, Environment and Climate Change
      Canada (ECCC), NOAA CO-OPS tides/currents, Great Lakes ice forecasts (NOAA
      GLERL, Canadian Ice Service), ENC/NTM/LNM, and terrestrial/satellite AIS.
    - >-
      Per-sailing risk score with contributing factors (wind/sea, visibility,
      current set/drift, traffic density, ice, NtM hazards) and confidence
      intervals; configurable to operator-specific risk thresholds and SMS.
    - >-
      Go/no-go and departure window recommendations for the next 0–72 hours,
      with uncertainty-aware suggestions and what-if tools for departure
      offsets.
    - >-
      Speed profile and route alternative optimization that meets time windows
      while minimizing exposure to adverse conditions and fuel burn; outputs
      per-leg recommended speeds and expected ETAs.
    - >-
      Real-time traffic-aware adjustments: AIS-based conflict prediction,
      overtaking/crossing risk alerts on planned tracks, and harbor congestion
      forecasts.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready audit trail: store advisory inputs, decisions, overrides,
      and notes per voyage for 24+ months; exportable for USCG Subchapter T/K,
      company SMS, and insurer reviews.
    - >-
      Crew- and dispatcher-facing interfaces: bridge tablet/PC and dispatch
      dashboard; API for integration with ECS, dispatch/scheduling, and public
      ETA feeds.
    - >-
      Alerting: SMS/email/push for window changes, new NtMs on route, ice
      restrictions, and forecast threshold crossings.
    - >-
      Offline-aware onboard module caching forecasts, tides, and AIS snapshots
      for last-mile resilience.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A route-specific, auditable decision-support co-pilot that fuses weather,
    tides/currents, LNM/NtM, ice, and AIS to recommend go/no-go, departure
    windows, speed profiles, and alternatives—cutting planning time by 50%,
    improving on-time performance by 10–20%, and reducing fuel burn 3–8% while
    strengthening SMS compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, labeled dataset of nearshore passenger sailings with decisions
    and outcomes across diverse routes and seasons, enabling uniquely
