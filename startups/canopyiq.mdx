leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Nursery and tree producers lose 5–15% of annual revenue to preventable
      pest/disease incidents due to delayed detection and misdiagnosis.
    - >-
      Shortage of trained scouts and plant pathologists causes slow response
      times (often 1–3 days from detection to action).
    - >-
      Existing consumer plant-ID apps lack accuracy and label-based treatment
      guidance for professional ornamental crops; enterprise ag tools focus on
      row crops, not ornamentals/trees.
    - >-
      Compliance burden: growers must follow EPA/state labels, REI/PHI, WPS
      recordkeeping; current workflows are manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Scouting data is fragmented across photos, texts, and paper, making it
      hard to learn from past outbreaks or measure ROI of treatments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile + web app for rapid photo-based triage with risk scoring
      (High/Urgent, Medium/Monitor, Low/Benign).
    - >-
      Top-3 diagnosis with confidence; automatically suggests differentials and
      “rule-in/rule-out” checks (symptoms to verify, quick tests).
    - >-
      Auto-generated, label-aligned treatment options/playbooks filtered by
      crop, growth stage, PHI/REI, state restrictions, and inventory on hand;
      includes cultural/mechanical/biological options.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop expert review network (licensed PCAs/CCAs/ornamental
      specialists) with SLA-based escalation for urgent cases.
    - >-
      Closed-loop outcomes tracking: verify post-treatment results with images,
      quantify efficacy, and refine future recommendations per site.
    - >-
      Offline capture + batch sync for low-connectivity fields; multi-language
      UI (English/Spanish).
    - >-
      APIs/integrations to nursery management and inventory systems to check
      product availability and log applications for compliance.
    - >-
      Benchmarking dashboards: hotspots by block/house, time-to-action, loss
      avoided, spray optimization.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From photo to compliant action in minutes: AI triages plant health images,
    prioritizes urgency, and produces label-aligned, crop-safe treatment
    playbooks tailored to each nursery’s inventory and regulations—reducing
    loss, labor, and risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rapidly compounding, specialty dataset and playbook library for
    ornamentals/tree crops—validated with Extension partners—and a
    compliance-grade label engine tightly integrated with growers’
    inventory/workflows. Network effects improve accuracy by region/crop, making
    replication costly for generalist competitors.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Professional nursery stock and field/tree producers (ornamental
      shrubs, shade trees, fruit/nut tree nurseries, Christmas tree farms). US:

      distributors/retailers offering value-added advisory to their grower
      customers.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    IPM leads, nursery/greenhouse and tree production teams who want rapid,
    reliable pest/disease triage and clear next steps.
  problem: >-
    External—look‑alike symptoms, scarce expertise, and time pressure make
    triage slow and inconsistent. Internal—fear of missed outbreaks and
    misapplication. Philosophical—growers shouldn’t lose crops or margins to
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to scout accurately, act fast, and stay
    label‑compliant. Our AI, developed with horticulture experts and aligned to
    extension/IPM guidance, gives clear, confident triage and actionable
    playbooks—privacy‑first and human‑in‑the‑loop.
  plan: >-
    1) Snap: Upload photos + context (crop, stage, location). 2) Triage: Get
    likely issues, urgency, and confidence. 3) Act: Review label‑aware playbooks
    and assign tasks. 4) Track: Log actions, monitor results, and refine. Always
    confirm labels and local regs before application.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct—Start a pilot with your crops; request pricing and onboarding.
    Transitional—Try the sandbox with sample images; download a sample triage
    report.
  success: >-
    Faster, consistent decisions; earlier detection and containment; fewer
    losses and re‑sprays; targeted, compliant treatments; audit‑ready
    documentation; quicker training for seasonal staff; protected schedules and
    ship dates.
  failure: >-
    Delayed diagnosis, spread across blocks, misapplied chemicals, compliance
    risk, higher costs and crop loss, rework, and unhappy customers.

    - 'Snap or upload plant photos (leaf, stem, canopy, pest close-ups).'
    - 'AI triages: likely issue, confidence, urgency, and spread risk.'
    - >-
      Review the proposed, label-compliant action plan with rates and safety
      notes.
    - 'Approve to create work orders, schedule crews, and check inventory.'
    - 'Execute treatment, log automatically, and get follow-up re-scan reminders.'
