  problem:
    - >-
      High setup/changeover losses: decorators require 45–90 min wash-ups per
      color; diameter tooling changes on bodymakers take 4–8 hours; end
      conversion dies 1–3 hours. Plants lose 8–15% of available hours to
      changeovers; poor sequences add 10–30% unnecessary changeovers.
    - >-
      Due date risk and expediting: demand spikes (promotions/seasonality) and
      constrained assets (decorators, seamers) drive OTD to 85–92%. Expedited
      freight and overtime add 1–3% to COGS.
    - >-
      Manual, siloed scheduling: planners juggle Excel, ERP/MES screens, and
      tribal rules. Schedules break with unplanned downtime; re-sequencing is
      slow and local-optimal (single machine), not cross-line/global.
    - >-
      Color/ink kitchen constraints ignored: limited ink mixing capacity, pot
      life, dark-to-light sequencing, and wash-up policies aren’t embedded,
      causing extra wash-ups and quality risks (residual color, startup scrap).
    - >-
      Ends-body line imbalance: ends conversion/lining and body lines are
      scheduled independently, creating WIP/shortages and starving seamers or
      overproducing ends.
    - >-
      Tooling and change parts conflicts: limited die sets, seamer chucks/rolls,
      decorator plates; maintenance intervals and cleaning cycles cause hidden
      capacity losses when not co-optimized.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: order/due dates in ERP, real-time states in
      MES/PLC/historian, tooling in EAM—no unified model to optimize against
      constraints and dynamic events.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimizer that sequences orders to minimize
      color/diameter changeovers while meeting due dates and inventory policies
      across bodymakers, decorators, seamers, and ends.
    - >-
      Digital twin of can lines with changeover-dependent setup times (color,
      coating, diameter/height, tooling), maintenance windows, tooling
      availability, and ink kitchen constraints (pot life, tank limits, mixing
      time).
    - >-
      Cross-resource synchronization: links body lines with seamers and ends
      conversion to avoid starvation/overproduction; enforces WIP buffers and
      storage limits.
    - >-
      Real-time rescheduling: reacts to downtime, quality holds, ink shortages,
      or rush orders; produces a feasible revised Gantt within minutes.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: planners simulate sequences (e.g., add shift, swap
      color order, defer order) with projected OTD, changeover hours, and
      overtime impacts.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP (orders/due dates/BOM), MES/PLC/historian (states,
      rates), EAM (tooling/PM), LIMS/ink management; prebuilt connectors for SAP
      PP, Siemens Opcenter, OSIsoft PI, Ignition.
    - >-
      Operator-facing dispatch lists and changeover instructions; planner UI
      shows KPIs (OTD risk, changeover minutes, run lengths) and constraint
      explanations for transparency.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase usable capacity 2–5% and reduce changeover time 20–40% by
    optimizing sequences across bodymakers, decorators, seamers, and ends, while
    lifting OTD to 95–98% within 90 days—without adding equipment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt can-industry changeover models (color-to-color, diameter/height,
    ink kitchen policies) and OEM-validated connectors enable rapid pilots (<4
    weeks) and reliable gains. The explanation engine builds planner trust by
    showing trade-offs, and anonymized industry benchmarks guide target setting.
    Partnerships with key OEMs/ink suppliers reduce integration friction
    competitors face.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations leaders and schedulers at metal can plants who must hit due dates
    while minimizing costly color and diameter changeovers across bodymakers,
    decorators, seamers, and end lines.
  problem: >-
    - External: SKU proliferation, volatile demand, and complex changeovers
    across linked assets create bottlenecks, downtime, and scrap.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting with spreadsheets, low trust in the plan,
    and stressed crews.

    - Philosophical: Time should be spent making cans, not washing up and
    swapping tooling.
  guide: >-
    We understand canmaking constraints. The Changeover-aware Scheduling
    Assistant is built for NAICS 332431, using changeover matrices for color,
    diameter, varnish, and tooling, and integrates with ERP/MES. Pilots show
    fewer changeovers and higher OEE with reliable, shop-floor-ready schedules.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders, routings, and asset calendars via ERP/MES or CSV.

    2) Configure changeover rules and constraints (crew, cooldown, setup,
    maintenance windows).

    3) Auto-generate an optimized finite schedule with what-if simulation;
    publish to lines and refresh as conditions change. Start with a 2-week pilot
    on one value stream.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 2-week pilot on one line.

    - Transitional: Download the Canmaking Scheduling Readiness Checklist and
    ROI calculator.
  success: |-
    - 15 to 30 percent fewer changeovers and wash-ups
    - 5 to 12 percent higher OEE and steadier throughput
    - On-time, in-full above 98 percent with fewer expedites
    - Lower ink/solvent use and scrap from color flips
    - Calmer shifts, less overtime, and a plan the floor trusts
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing unplanned changeovers, idle assets, and missed due dates

    - Expedited freight, excess WIP, overtime, and quality risks from rushed
    setups

    - Frustrated customers and eroding margins
