  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers struggle to keep up with continually changing standards
      (e.g., DLC revisions, Title 24 cycles, IECC/ASHRAE 90.1 adoptions by
      state), causing rework and delays.
    - >-
      Manual compliance checks of spec sheets, LM-79/LM-80/TM-21 data, IES
      files, and control features are slow (2–6 hours per SKU submission) and
      error-prone, leading to failed submissions or costly redesigns.
    - >-
      Disparate regional utility rebate rules and eligibility criteria (often
      tied to DLC categories and minimum efficacies) change quarterly; sales
      teams miss incentives or quote the wrong amounts.
    - >-
      Inconsistent product data across PLM/PIM, spec sheets, and QPL entries
      leads to out-of-date or contradictory information in the field and poor
      first-pass yield on program submissions.
    - >-
      Lack of early warning on upcoming code/standard changes (e.g., DLC
      effective dates, Title 24 updates) results in late engineering changes,
      stranded inventory, and missed launch windows.
    - >-
      No unified, auditable trail tying product attributes to compliance claims
      exposes the business to legal risk and credibility loss with utilities,
      specifiers, and AHJs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rules engine encodes DLC categories (SSL/NLC), Title 24 Part 6,
      IECC/ASHRAE 90.1 requirements; auto-evaluates SKUs from product data, IES
      files, and lab reports.
    - >-
      Document intelligence parses PDFs and IES files (LM-79, LM-80, TM-21, spec
      sheets) to extract required parameters (efficacy, CRI, CCT, THD/PF,
      controls readiness) and map to rules.
    - >-
      Regional rebate engine matches SKUs to utility programs by
      ZIP/state/province, shows incentive amounts and terms, and flags missing
      prerequisites (e.g., DLC listing).
    - >-
      Checklist and submittal builder auto-generates DLC application checklists,
      Title 24/IECC compliance statements, and sales-ready submittal packages
      with evidence attachments.
    - >-
      Change monitoring and alerts for upcoming standard and program changes
      with SKU impact analysis and work plans to maintain compliance before
      effective dates.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations to PLM/PIM/ERP/CPQ (e.g., Arena, Propel, Windchill,
      Salsify, Salesforce CPQ) to keep a single source of truth and push
      compliance statuses to sales tools.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One system to make every SKU rebate-ready and code-ready: from spec sheet to
    DLC/Title 24/IECC compliance report and regional rebate map in minutes, with
    an auditable trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Continuously updated, versioned rules graph tied to a large corpus of real
    manufacturer SKUs, lab reports, and program outcomes, enabling
    high-accuracy, defensible compliance decisions and first-pass approvals;
    deep PLM/CPQ integrations that embed compliance and rebates directly in the
    manufacturer’s workflow; rapid-change alerting with SKU-level impact
    forecasts.

  character: >-
    Product, compliance, and sales engineering teams at
    commercial/industrial/institutional lighting fixture manufacturers (NAICS
    335132) who must prove code compliance and capture rebates to win specs and
    bids.
  problem: >-
    DLC, Title 24, and IECC rules change constantly and vary by region; utility
    programs are fragmented. Manual checks and spreadsheets cause misses—lost
    incentives, delayed launches, rework, and risk of noncompliant submissions
    that cost deals.

    We understand the grind of certifications and submittals. Our AI rules
    engine maps your fixtures to DLC/Title 24/IECC categories and regional
    utility programs—backed by continuously updated rules, verified data
    sources, audit trails, and lighting‑industry expertise.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload spec sheet/BOM and target region. 2) Instantly get category
    matches, pass/fail flags, application checklists, and available rebates. 3)
    Export application‑ready packets or push via API to PLM/CPQ. Ongoing: change
    alerts, version control, and compliance history.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial or book a 20‑minute demo. Transitional: Download
    a sample compliance report and rebate map, or run the ROI calculator on one
    SKU.
  success: >-
    Fast, confident submittals; captured rebates by region; higher win rates and
    margins; shorter time‑to‑quote; fewer reworks; scalable launches across
    codes and utilities.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing—submit noncompliant packages, forfeit incentives, suffer
    rework cycles, slip launch dates, and lose deals to compliant competitors.
