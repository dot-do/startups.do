leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts of ACQ/CA, borates, or creosote cause unplanned downtime and
      missed shipments; many plants face 2–6 stockout events/year.
    - >-
      Price volatility in copper derivatives and petrochemicals leads to 3–10%
      annual swings; most plants lack tools to hedge or time buys against market
      indices.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheet forecasting yields 20–35% MAPE, causing overstock (cash
      tied up) or shortages (expedites).
    - >-
      Lead-time variability (5–30+ days) and supplier MOQs complicate reorder
      points; policies are static and not revisited often.
    - >-
      Multi-plant organizations cannot see aggregate demand or rebalance
      inventory quickly, leading to excess safety stock by site.
    - >-
      Procurement cycle times are slow (2–5 days) and compliance-heavy for
      HAZMAT POs; approvals and documents are fragmented.
    - >-
      No unified view that merges sensor/tank levels, ERP, production plans, and
      external signals (weather, housing starts, LME copper).
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-integrated forecasting: Merge ERP usage, production plans,
      recipes/retention rates, tank/silo sensors, and external signals (LME
      copper, diesel/freight, housing starts, weather seasonality).
    - >-
      Dynamic inventory policy: Service-level targeted safety stock and reorder
      points per SKU/site, recalculated weekly with lead-time variability and
      MOQs/rounding.
    - >-
      Auto-procurement agent: Drafts supplier-specific POs with price tiers,
      delivery windows, HAZMAT docs; routes through configurable approvals;
      pushes to ERP.
    - >-
      Price-risk timing & alerts: Buy-window recommendations vs indices and
      supplier quotes; simulate impact of earlier/later buys and hedging
      thresholds.
    - >-
      Multi-plant pooling: Suggests inter-site transfers and consolidated buys
      to hit price breaks and reduce total safety stock.
    - >-
      Compliance & audit: Auto-attach SDS/COAs, UN numbers, packaging/transport
      notes; approval trails; user permissions; SOC 2 controls.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: Demand spikes, new shifts, recipe changes, supplier
      outages; simulate service levels, cost, and days of supply impacts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI for wood preservation that forecasts preservative demand,
    optimizes reorder points, and auto-drafts compliant POs—cutting stockouts to
    near-zero, reducing working capital 10–20%, and smoothing price risk with
    data-driven timing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical depth: models incorporate treatment recipes, retention targets,
    tank dynamics, and HAZMAT compliance with supplier- and route-level
    lead-time variability—plus IoT telemetry. Network effects from aggregated
    (anonymized) demand/lead-time/price signals improve recommendations over
    time. Co-sell distribution via preservative suppliers and certified ERP
    connectors lowers acquisition cost and switching friction.

    Plant managers and procurement leaders at wood‑treatment facilities who need
    uninterrupted, compliant preservative supply at the best cost.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile lead times, price swings, and unpredictable usage;
    compliance demands. Internal: low trust in spreadsheets and fear of
    stockouts or overbuying. Philosophical: critical infrastructure shouldn’t
    depend on guesswork.

    team blends wood‑preservation expertise with proven ML forecasting; secure,
    ERP‑integrated, and trusted by leading treaters.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect usage, inventory, and supplier data. 2) Generate site‑specific
    forecasts and reorder points. 3) Auto‑draft POs and sourcing recommendations
    with human approvals. 4) Monitor exceptions, supplier risk, and savings.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot with your last 12 months of data. Transitional:
    Request a sample forecast, ROI estimate, and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Right‑sized inventory, zero avoidable stockouts, lower total cost, optimal
    PO timing and quantities, audit‑ready records, confident planning, and more
    throughput with less firefighting.
  failure: >-
    Stockouts halt treating schedules, rush premiums and price spikes erode
    margin, audits flag gaps, crews idle, contracts slip, and cash gets trapped
    in excess inventory.
