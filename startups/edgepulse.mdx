  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned grinder spindle/bearing failures create 6–16 hours of downtime
      per event at $8,000–$25,000 per hour; failures often show precursors
      (vibration, temperature, current) that are not captured or acted on.
    - >-
      Heat-treat oven drift (thermocouple degradation, uneven load, element
      failure) produces off-spec hardness and microstructure, leading to 1–3%
      batch scrap/rework ($5,000–$30,000 per batch) and customer quality claims.
    - >-
      Coater (PVD/CVD) vacuum pump/seal failures and chiller faults cause 1–2
      days of lost capacity, forcing expensive outsourcing or missed ship dates.
    - >-
      Setter misalignment and wear increase scrap and rework on tooth geometry
      and set angle, degrading cut performance and creating potential safety
      risk.
    - >-
      Maintenance teams are understaffed and rely on calendar-based PM; there is
      no continuous condition monitoring across grinders, setters, ovens, and
      coaters.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous equipment (vintage PLCs, different OEMs) lacks a unified
      view; logs are siloed and not integrated with CMMS/EAM for proactive work
      orders.
    - >-
      OEM monitoring options are siloed to their own machines and rarely cover
      mixed-fleet plants or cross-process correlations (grinding → heat treat →
      coating).
    - >-
      Data sensitivity and shop-floor connectivity constraints (air-gapped
      cells; legacy controls) limit adoption of generic cloud analytics
      solutions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turnkey sensor kits for grinders, setters, heat-treat ovens, and coaters
      (tri-axial vibration, current, temperature, vacuum, cycle counters) with
      safe, non-invasive installation.
    - >-
      Edge gateway with OPC UA/Modbus/MQTT connectivity and on-edge feature
      extraction for low-latency alerts; optional air-gapped mode with weekly
      USB sync.
    - >-
      Asset-specific AI models pre-trained on blade/tool process signatures to
      detect anomalies and forecast failures (1–14 day horizon) with recommended
      maintenance actions.
    - >-
      Cross-process analytics: link grinder condition to downstream heat-treat
      scrap trends and coating rejects to identify systemic issues.
    - >-
      CMMS/EAM integration (SAP PM, Maximo, eMaint, Fiix, UpKeep): auto-create
      work orders with severity, parts recommendations, and estimated
      time-to-failure.
    - >-
      Role-based dashboards (Ops, Maintenance, Quality) with mobile alerts
      (SMS/Teams/Email) and escalation policies; anomaly explainability for
      technician trust.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability reporting: capture cycle, temperature, and
      vibration histories for PPAP/ISO/AS audits and customer returns analysis.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment playbook: 2–4 weeks to go-live, starting with 10–20
      critical assets; ROI reporting at 30/60/90 days.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime 25–40% and scrap 5–15% in grinding, heat-treat,
    and coating within 90 days using retrofit sensors and AI models tuned to saw
    blade and hand tool processes—payback in under 6 months, compatible with
    mixed-vintage equipment and secure edge/cloud options.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical depth: a curated, proprietary failure-mode library and
    physics-informed models specifically for grinders, setters, heat-treat
    ovens, and coaters used in saw blade and hand tool manufacturing, plus OEM
    data interfaces and retrofit kits that work across mixed-vintage fleets.
    This yields faster time-to-value (≤30 days to first save), higher model
    accuracy, and defensible switching costs via historical traceability and
    CMMS workflows.

  character: >-
    Ops and Maintenance leaders at NAICS 332216 plants who must keep grinders,
    setters, heat‑treat ovens, and coaters running to hit OEE, scrap, and
    delivery targets.
  problem: >-
    Unplanned failures and process drift create scrap, rework, and missed
    shipments. Teams are stuck firefighting with siloed
    vibration/current/temperature/cycle data and tribal knowledge—when machines
    should warn before they fail.
  guide: >-
    We understand plant‑floor pressure. Our OT‑savvy engineers and data
    scientists deploy AI that explains anomalies, integrates with
    PLC/SCADA/CMMS, and proves value fast—without disrupting production.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest vibration, motor current, temperature, and cycle logs
    from grinders, setters, ovens, and coaters; 2) Learn: build asset‑specific
    anomaly detection and failure‑forecast models; 3) Act: deliver prioritized
    alerts, RUL, and checklists into your CMMS and daily huddles. Pilot quickly,
    no rip‑and‑replace, secure and vendor‑agnostic.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a line assessment or start a 60–90 day pilot. Transitional:
    download the readiness checklist and ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    Predictable uptime, lower scrap, stabilized processes, longer asset and
    tooling life, safer operations, reliable promise dates, and audit‑ready
    traceability driven by data—not firefighting.
  failure: >-
    Recurring breakdowns, oven drift and coating defects that scrap batches,
    rushed changeovers, overtime and expediting, missed deliveries, and eroding
    customer trust.
