  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts of top-selling paint bases, rollers, and seasonal SKUs
      during spring/summer peaks lead to lost sales and rush orders.
    - >-
      Excess and aged inventory (e.g., slow-moving wallpaper patterns, niche
      sheens) ties up working capital and reduces GMROI.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven purchasing consumes 10–20 hours per week per
      store and is error-prone (ignores vendor pack sizes/MOQs and lead-time
      variability).
    - >-
      POS/ERP reorder points are static and not tuned to local seasonality,
      promotions, or weather; safety stock is guesswork.
    - >-
      Tint colorant forecasting is overlooked, causing tint shortages that halt
      fulfillment despite adequate base inventory.
    - >-
      Multi-store balancing is ad hoc; transfers are underused, causing
      simultaneous stockouts and overstock across locations.
    - >-
      Vendor lead times and pack sizes vary by supplier and region; ordering
      rules are inconsistently applied across buyers.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true demand drivers (weather shifts, housing
      turnover, local projects) limits proactive ordering.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven forecasts at SKU/store level with weekly horizon (12–26 weeks)
      leveraging seasonality, promotions, weather forecasts, and lead-time
      variability.
    - >-
      Auto-generated PO drafts with service-level targets (e.g., 95% fill),
      safety stock, vendor pack rounding, MOQs, price breaks, and order cadence
      rules.
    - >-
      Colorant usage forecasting linked to base paint sales to prevent tint
      outages; alerts for near-term shortages.
    - >-
      Store-to-store transfer recommendations before reordering to rebalance
      inventory and reduce working capital.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow: buyers review only items with forecast variance,
      supplier constraints, or budget conflicts; everything else auto-approves.
    - >-
      Weather-responsive demand: pre-emptive increases for exterior products
      when favorable windows appear (temperature/humidity) and throttling for
      adverse weather.
    - >-
      Dead stock detection and clearance recommendations (markdowns, bundles,
      return-to-vendor options where applicable).
    - >-
      Performance cockpit showing service levels, WAPE/MAPE by category, turns,
      GMROI, and weeks-of-supply by class.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI forecasting and auto-reorder suggestions built specifically for paint and
    wallpaper retailers. TintWise AI uses store/SKU-level seasonality, local
    weather signals, vendor constraints, and colorant usage to cut stockouts
    25–40%, reduce excess inventory 10–25%, and automate 70–90% of purchasing
    decisions within 3–6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific models that incorporate tint colorant usage, vendor
    pack/MOQ idiosyncrasies, and weather-driven demand—plus prebuilt POS/vendor
    integrations. Aggregated, privacy-preserving demand patterns across
    retailers accelerate cold-start accuracy and enable benchmarks competitors
    can’t replicate quickly.
