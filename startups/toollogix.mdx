  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime costs: A single critical tool outage can cost
      $50k–$500k per day in lost output and scrap; many failures are still
      detected only after alarms or process excursions.
    - >-
      Low early-warning sensitivity: Existing FDC/SPC limits often miss weak
      signals (e.g., rising pump current ripple, RF reflected power drift) that
      precede failures by days to weeks.
    - >-
      High false alarm fatigue: Alarm floods (>1,000/day on complex tools)
      reduce technician trust; precision is often <60% in real-world conditions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: SECS/GEM events, EDA (Interface A) traces, OEM
      proprietary logs, and chiller/RF/pump telemetry live in silos; correlation
      across subsystems is manual and slow.
    - >-
      Skilled labor shortage: Senior equipment engineers are scarce; time spent
      manually reviewing logs can exceed 6–8 hours per week per tool family.
    - >-
      Reactive spares planning: Parts are stocked based on rough MTBF or tribal
      knowledge, tying up capital and still missing urgent needs.
    - >-
      OEM warranty/service risk: OEMs carry significant warranty and service
      costs from early-life failures without timely detection and root cause
      attribution.
    - >-
      Security/compliance barriers: Many fabs restrict cloud connectivity;
      solutions requiring continuous cloud streaming are non-starters.
    - >-
      Model drift and process changes: Frequent recipe/tool updates shift
      baselines, degrading static models without robust drift management.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive ingestion of existing logs: SECS/GEM events, EDA
      E120/E125/E164 traces, OEM subsystem logs (vacuum, RF, chillers, robotics)
      without additional sensors.
    - >-
      Domain-specific feature library: 1,000+ engineered features (e.g., pump
      current ripple %, base pressure decay slope, RF reflected power drift,
      temperature control error dynamics).
    - >-
      Multimodal models: Combine time-series, events, and recipes to detect weak
      signals and correlate across subsystems (e.g., RF fault driven by chiller
      flow drop).
    - >-
      Early warning scores with lead-time targets: Alerts aim for 7–21 days
      advance notice for pumps/chillers, 3–10 days for RF/matches, with
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Actionable guidance: Prescribes checks, parts, and estimated time to
      failure; links to BOM/part numbers and technical procedures.
    - >-
      Automated drift management: Adaptive baselining per tool/recipe and
      champion-challenger model governance to maintain precision/recall after
      process changes.
    - >-
      Root cause and post-mortem: Annotates failures to grow a cross-OEM failure
      signature library and closes the loop with technician feedback.
    - >-
      CMMS/MES integration: Create work orders and planned downtime windows in
      SAP PM/Maximo; log findings to MES/FDC (e.g., PDF Solutions Exensio).
    - >-
      Deployment flexibility: Air-gapped on-prem appliance or private cloud;
      data never leaves site unless explicitly allowed.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    On-prem, multi-vendor anomaly detection that turns native tool logs into
    7–21 day early failure warnings and actionable part/maintenance
    recommendations—reducing unplanned downtime 20–40% with <1 false alert per
    asset per week.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-vendor failure signature library and pre-trained models
    purpose-built for semiconductor subsystems, deployable fully on-prem without
    adding sensors. Deep SEMI standards integration (SECS/GEM, EDA) and proven
    precision/lead-time targets reduce time-to-value to weeks, not quarters.
    Co-development with subsystem OEMs enables access to proprietary telemetry
    fields and service procedures, improving actionability beyond generic PdM
    platforms.

    Equipment engineering and service managers in semiconductor machinery (NAICS
    333242) responsible for uptime, yield, and SLAs.
  problem: >-
    Weak failure signals in vacuum pumps, RF generators, chillers, robotics, and
    chambers hide in time-series and event logs; issues only surface as alarms
    or tool-down events, causing scrap, missed shipments, and costly dispatches.
  guide: >-
    We understand every minute of tool-down time is expensive. Our AI analyzes
    exported tool logs with domain-validated models to surface early failure
    signals and provide clear, actionable recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Securely export or stream logs via API/SFTP; 2) We detect anomalies,
    estimate remaining useful life, and rank risks by tool and failure mode; 3)
    You receive prioritized alerts, parts lists, and step-by-step actions, then
    close the loop with feedback.
  callToAction: >-
    Launch a 30-day pilot on a target tool family—upload one week of logs to get
    a live risk dashboard, recommended interventions, and an ROI summary.
  success: >-
    Predict failures days to weeks early; cut unplanned downtime and scrap;
    right-size spares; improve MTBF, OEE, and on-time delivery; boost customer
    trust and margin.
  failure: >-
    Continue reacting to alarms and breakdowns—paying for expedited parts,
    overtime, warranty claims, missed orders, and avoidable yield loss.
