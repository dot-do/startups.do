leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Delayed lab turnaround (typically 1–6 hours) for Mooney viscosity and Tg
      leads to late detection of off-spec product, causing scrap/rework and lost
      throughput.
    - >-
      High variability in feedstock and reactor conditions (temperature
      profiles, initiator levels, agitation, residence time) makes manual
      control unable to anticipate quality drifts.
    - >-
      Grade changes and startups have elevated OOS risk due to transient
      dynamics; lack of real-time inferential quality limits proactive actions.
    - >-
      Existing inferential models are either generic (poor accuracy), static
      (drift over time), or hard to maintain (no MLOps) leading to loss of trust
      by operators and quality teams.
    - >-
      Unplanned lab reruns and confirmatory tests extend cycle times and consume
      technician capacity.
    - >-
      Quality systems (IATF 16949/ISO 9001) require traceable decisions; current
      spreadsheets and ad hoc models lack auditability and governance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy on-prem/edge AI service connected to DCS/PLC and historian
      (PI/IP.21/PHD) to infer Mooney and Tg every 1–5 minutes with confidence
      intervals and OOS risk scores.
    - >-
      Provide early-warning alarms and recommended setpoint moves (feed-forward
      guidance) during steady-state and transitions (grade changes/startups).
    - >-
      Implement robust MLOps: data drift detection, auto-recalibration workflows
      gated by quality approval, versioned models with full audit trail.
    - >-
      Operator-facing HMI widgets and web dashboards for trend, what-if
      simulation, and operator notes aligned to batch/lot IDs.
    - >-
      Quality integration: automatic attachment of predictions and uncertainties
      to lots in LIMS/MES with electronic sign-off policies to support IATF/ISO
      audits.
    - >-
      Rapid rollout playbook: 6–8 week pilot per unit using historical data +
      live shadow mode, then controlled cutover with success criteria and ROI
      tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, real-time predictions of Mooney and Tg from plant signals—60–180
    minutes before lab results—so operators can prevent off-spec batches,
    shorten cycle times, and increase first-pass yield with validated,
    maintainable soft sensors purpose-built for synthetic rubber.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Transfer-learning library and physics-informed features purpose-built for
    Mooney/Tg in synthetic rubber, enabling faster cold-start with high
    accuracy; validated uncertainty estimates aligned to lab MSA; and an
    audit-ready MLOps framework that quality teams can own without data-science
    staff.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, process engineers, and quality leaders in synthetic rubber
    (NAICS 325212) who must hit Mooney viscosity and Tg specs every run while
    increasing throughput and reducing lab delays.
  problem: >-
    Lab properties are measured offline and late; process drift and grade
    switches cause variability and OOS before anyone knows. Teams are stuck
    firefighting, waiting on lab results, and absorbing rework, scrap, and lost
    capacity. Quality shouldn’t be discovered hours later—it should be known in
    real time.
  guide: >-
    We understand reactors, finishing lines, and QC labs in polymer plants. Our
    team blends chemical engineering with industrial ML to build validated soft
    sensors from your historian and LIMS, with transparent models, data
    governance, and secure deployment aligned to industry best practices. We
    help operators trust predictions and QA approve their use.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess data readiness and define target grades/methods for Mooney/Tg. 2)
    Build and backtest soft sensors; set acceptance criteria with QA. 3) Deploy
    real-time predictions with early warnings and operator guidance in
    DCS/portal; iterate via MLOps.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute discovery and select a pilot line.
    Transitional: Request the one-page brief and ROI checklist.
  success: >-
    Real-time Mooney and Tg predictions let teams catch drift early and adjust
    before OOS. Shorter cycle times and fewer lab holds; less reblend and scrap;
    higher throughput and service levels. A calmer control room and confident QA
    signoff.
  failure: >-
    Without early quality, OOS batches persist, rework and delays grow, margins
    erode, and audits flag preventable deviations. Operators keep firefighting
    blind and customers lose confidence.
