leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Lengthy alloy and process development cycles (6–18 months) slow NPI and
      tie up capital in trials and WIP.
    - >-
      Trade-off management is hard: hitting target conductivity (e.g., 70–95%
      IACS) while achieving required strength/elongation and formability often
      requires many iterations.
    - >-
      High scrap and rework (3–8% typical in changeovers) from out-of-spec
      conductivity, hardness, or formability; first-pass yield is inconsistent.
    - >-
      Energy-intensive heat treatments and over-processing add 5–15% avoidable
      energy cost per tonne.
    - >-
      Limited use of plant data and physics together: CALPHAD used by R&D, but
      not integrated with MES/SCADA or shop-floor constraints, causing scale-up
      gaps between lab and line.
    - >-
      Volatility in alloying element costs (e.g., Sn, Ni, Cr, Ag) makes recipes
      expensive and margins unpredictable; no automated cost-performance
      optimization.
    - >-
      Compliance risk (RoHS/REACH/ELV lead/cadmium limits; DFARS;
      customer-specific specs) is checked late, causing redesigns and delays.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge concentrated in veteran metallurgists; turnover creates
      knowledge gaps and repeat mistakes.
    - >-
      Qualification with downstream OEMs (EV, electronics, HVAC, aerospace)
      requires stable processes and data packages that are time-consuming to
      produce.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and model build: unify historical plant runs
      (MES/SCADA/PI), lab test results, and CALPHAD thermodynamics/kinetics into
      a copper-specific digital twin.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization: automatically generate alloy compositions
      and heat-treatment schedules to meet targets for conductivity, strength,
      elongation, formability, and cost under compliance and process
      constraints.
    - >-
      Heat-treatment advisor: prescribes time–temperature–atmosphere schedules
      (solution, aging, precipitation) with uncertainty bounds, tuned to
      specific furnaces and line speeds.
    - >-
      Cost and supply sensitivity: optimize against current and forecasted
      alloying element prices and availability; suggest cost-equivalent
      substitutes within spec windows.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: real-time checks against RoHS/REACH/ELV and customer
      specifications (e.g., Pb/Cd limits), with audit-ready documentation.
    - >-
      Scale-up guardrails: model corrections for line-specific quench rates,
      coil sizes, extrusion ratios, and work hardening; alerts for drift and
      seasonal effects.
    - >-
      Experiment planner: minimal set of confirmation runs via DoE to de-risk
      before full-scale production; auto-generated qualification data packs for
      OEMs.
    - >-
      Integration: connectors to Thermo-Calc/Pandat, Ansys Granta MI, OSIsoft
      PI/AVEVA, SAP/Oracle, and QMS for closed-loop control and traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut alloy and heat-treatment development time by 50%, increase conductivity
    at target strength by 1–3% IACS, and lower scrap/energy 10–20% by unifying
    CALPHAD physics with plant data and AI to deliver production-ready copper
    alloy recipes and heat-treatment schedules that meet cost and compliance
    constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A copper-focused, production-grade dataset and physics-informed AI stack
    that fuses CALPHAD with real plant behavior (work hardening, quench rates,
    coil geometry, furnace dynamics), delivered with OEM/PI/MES integrations and
    compliance-by-design. Network effects grow as more plants contribute
    de-identified data, improving accuracy and optimization speed in ways
    generic materials AI or standalone CALPHAD cannot match.

  character: >-
    Plant managers and metallurgical/process engineers at copper rolling,
    drawing, extrusion, and alloying operations (NAICS 331420) who must hit
    property specs at the lowest cost and risk.
  problem: >-
    Balancing conductivity, strength, formability, cost, and compliance is slow,
    trial-and-error work; volatile metal prices and tight customer specs create
    rework and delays; fragmented know-how leads to off-spec lots,
    over-alloying, and margin squeeze.
  guide: >-
    Alloy Recipe and Heat-Treatment Optimizer is a CALPHAD+AI service built on
    copper-specific databases and expert metallurgical oversight. We validate
    against your shop data and industry standards, integrate with ERP/LIMS, and
    safeguard IP—so recommendations are trusted and actionable.
  plan: >-
    1) Define target specs, process routes, and constraints. 2) Ingest
    historical compositions, process windows, and cost/compliance limits. 3) Run
    CALPHAD/AI to propose chemistries and heat-treat schedules optimized for
    properties and cost. 4) Review with your team and run a focused pilot. 5)
    Implement, monitor, and continuously refine with a digital recipe twin.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a technical scoping call or start a paid pilot on a
    priority grade/line. Transitional: Request a sample optimization report or a
    free feasibility screen with anonymized data.
  success: >-
    First-pass qualification with predictable properties; fewer trials and
    faster NPI; leaner, lower-cost chemistries and heat-treats; reduced scrap
    and energy; assured RoHS/REACH/ASTM compliance; captured know-how and a
    maintainable digital recipe twin.
  failure: >-
    Prolonged trial cycles, off-spec shipments, over-alloying and wasted metal,
    missed quotes and delivery dates, compliance surprises, and loss of tribal
    knowledge to turnover.
