  problem:
    - >-
      Slow time-to-quote: manual quoting takes 45–120 minutes per inquiry;
      response times >24 hours reduce close rates and cause lead drop-off.
    - >-
      Margin leakage: inconsistent markups, currency slippage, and out-of-date
      supplier rates often erode 2–5 percentage points of gross margin per
      itinerary.
    - >-
      Fragmented supplier data: contracts and rates live in PDFs, spreadsheets,
      emails, portals—difficult to search and standardize for pricing and
      availability.
    - >-
      Inconsistent branding and quality: proposals vary by sales agent; brand,
      tone, and inclusions are not standardized; revision/version control is
      painful.
    - >-
      Poor upsell/cross-sell: limited, manual prompting of upgrades, add-ons,
      and experiences; missed revenue per itinerary.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: operators lack visibility into quote turnaround time,
      quote->book conversion, margin by segment, and supplier performance.
    - >-
      Seasonality and staffing: onboarding and training new sales consultants is
      slow; quality drops during peaks; time zone coverage for inbound leads is
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      Multi-currency, tax, and compliance complexity: error-prone FX conversion,
      VAT/GST handling, and supplier terms management across destinations.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI intake and qualification: parse inbound emails/forms/WhatsApp to
      extract traveler preferences, dates, budget, party details, and
      constraints.
    - >-
      Constraint-based itinerary builder: auto-assemble routes, lodging,
      activities, and transfers from your supplier catalog and contracts;
      respects seasonality, opening hours, and travel times.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing and margin control: apply contract rates, FX, taxes, and
      tiered markups with guardrails (min/max margin per category); simulate
      profitability.
    - >-
      Branded proposal generator: produce multi-language, multi-currency, fully
      branded proposals with day-by-day detail, imagery, maps,
      inclusions/exclusions, and T&Cs.
    - >-
      Upsell engine: algorithmically suggest premium room categories, private
      guides, add-on experiences, and insurance; A/B test recommendations.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop editor: drag-and-drop editor to tweak routes, swap
      suppliers, adjust pace; version control and approval workflows.
    - >-
      One-click quote delivery and follow-up: personalized email/portal links,
      read receipts, auto-reminders, and chatbot Q&A to handle clarifications.
    - >-
      Integrations: sync leads and quotes with CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce),
      supplier systems (Wetu/Tourplan/Rezdy), payments (deposit links via
      Stripe/Adyen), and calendars.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboards for TTFQ (time-to-first-quote), conversion, margin
      by segment, supplier win rate, and consultant productivity.
    - >-
      Learning loop: model improves from accepted/rejected proposals, margin
      outcomes, and supplier performance; content library improves over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate a priced, branded itinerary proposal with controlled margins and
    upsell options in under 5 minutes—directly from an inbound
    inquiry—integrated with your supplier contracts, content, and CRM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound learning on a proprietary corpus of itineraries, supplier
    performance, and conversion outcomes—improving routing, pacing, and upsell
    recommendations over time—combined with deterministic margin controls, deep
    integrations into operator systems, and high switching costs from custom
    templates, mapped supplier catalogs, and policy rules.
