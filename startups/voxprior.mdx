  problem:
    - >-
      Customer feedback and product usage data are fragmented across ticketing
      systems, call recordings, user forums, field service notes, and instrument
      telemetry, making it hard to form a single, quantifiable view of customer
      needs.
    - >-
      Product teams struggle to quantify impact: they cannot easily tie issues
      and feature requests to installed base size, revenue at risk, or service
      cost, leading to anecdotal prioritization and misallocated R&D spend.
    - >-
      Long feedback-to-release cycle (often 6–12 months) with many duplicate or
      low-impact items; lack of auditable traceability from VOC to backlog
      decisions challenges GxP/ISO quality practices and executive review.
    - >-
      Support costs and renewal risk increase when recurring issues aren’t
      rapidly surfaced and resolved at root cause across instrument models and
      software versions.
    - >-
      Generic VOC or product analytics tools miss lab-instrument domain
      specifics (modalities, methods, consumables, firmware/software versions),
      limiting accuracy and actionability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion connectors for Salesforce/Service Cloud, Zendesk,
      ServiceMax, ServiceNow, SAP C4C; call platforms (Five9, Genesys, Amazon
      Connect); forums (Discourse, Salesforce Communities); and telemetry from
      instrument gateways/IoT (AWS/Azure IoT, OPC-UA, vendor-specific logs).
    - >-
      Domain-tuned LLM/NLP that classifies, clusters, and deduplicates issues
      and feature requests using an analytical-instrument ontology
      (chromatography, MS, spectroscopy, method parameters, firmware/software
      versions, accessories, consumables).
    - >-
      Impact scoring engine that quantifies revenue at risk and value: ties
      issues to installed base, ARR/renewals, NPS, contract penalties, and
      service cost; supports ICE/RICE/WSJF with configurable weights.
    - >-
      Backlog orchestration: pushes prioritized epics/stories with impact
      evidence into Jira, Azure DevOps, or Polarion; maintains a CFR Part
      11–style audit trail from VOC signal to roadmap decision and release.
    - >-
      Root-cause and cohort analysis linking telemetry signatures to support
      themes; version/regression detection to catch firmware/software-specific
      spikes quickly.
    - >-
      Reporting and executive dashboards: top drivers by product line and
      region, effort vs. impact matrix, trend alerts, ROI tracker, and
      quality/CAPA linkage.
    - >-
      Privacy, security, and deployment options: SOC 2 and ISO 27001–aligned
      controls, PII/PHI redaction, on-premises/hybrid data plane for sensitive
      logs, data residency options (US/EU).
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Product, service, and R&D leaders at analytical laboratory instrument
    manufacturers (NAICS 334516) who need a clear, quantified voice-of-customer
    to decide what to build next.
  problem: >-
    External: Customer feedback is scattered across tickets, service calls,
    forums, and device telemetry; prioritization is slow, biased, and
    disconnected from impact.

    Internal: Teams feel flooded with anecdotes, argue opinions, and lack
    confidence in roadmap choices; support escalations and delays drain focus.

    Philosophical: Companies that enable critical science should have objective,
    transparent customer demand signals—not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand multi-instrument portfolios, regulated lab
    environments, long service lifecycles, and the pain of reconciling
    conflicting requests.

    Authority: Purpose-built NLP for technical text, telemetry analytics, and
    privacy-first pipelines; clear scoring models that tie requests to revenue,
    risk, quality, and uptime.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect: Securely ingest tickets, call transcripts, community posts, and
    telemetry from your existing tools.

    2) Mine & quantify: Cluster themes, de-duplicate requests, and score impact
    by customer segments, install base, ARR, risk, and effort.

    3) Prioritize & act: Generate a ranked backlog with rationale, trade-offs,
    and release simulations; push to your PM/ALM tools.

    Agreement plan:

    - Data security commitments, PII redaction, and auditability; short pilot on
    one product line; success criteria defined up front.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery and start a 6–8 week pilot on a
    target instrument family.

    Transitional: Download the VoC maturity checklist and sample prioritization
    scorecard.
  success: >-
    Faster, defensible roadmap decisions; higher feature adoption; fewer
    escalations and warranty costs; improved NPS/CSAT; clearer trade-offs across
    quality, compliance, and revenue; visible impact per release and closed-loop
    learning from the field.
  failure: >-
    Roadmaps driven by anecdotes; missed market windows; rising support burden;
    building low-impact features while critical needs linger; avoidable churn
    and lost deals; hidden quality and compliance risks persisting in the field.
