leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers operating in 5+ states spend 40–120 hours/month reconciling
      ship-to jurisdiction excise taxes across state, county, and city rules.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheets and legacy tools lead to 1–3% calculation errors and
      missed rule changes, creating penalty exposure ($5k–$50k/year) and audit
      risk.
    - >-
      Each jurisdiction has unique forms, tax bases (per-stick, per‑mL, ad
      valorem), exemptions, schedules, and due dates; building filing-ready
      workpapers is time-consuming and brittle.
    - >-
      ERP/OMS data lacks clean product tax attributes (e.g., stick count, mg/mL,
      wholesale vs. floor price), causing exception backlogs and delayed
      filings.
    - >-
      Teams struggle to produce audit-ready evidence (data lineage, versioning,
      sign-offs), increasing the cost and duration of audits by weeks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from ERP/OMS/WMS and carriers; AI classification
      enriches items with required excise attributes (e.g., sticks, ounces, mL,
      nicotine concentration, wholesale price).
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-aware tax engine computes excise by destination
      state/county/city with rule-effective dating, exemptions, and product-type
      logic.
    - >-
      Filing packs auto-generate: jurisdiction schedules, cross-footed
      workpapers, and exportable PDFs/CSVs mapped to official forms; optional
      managed e-filing where available.
    - >-
      Exception management: variance flags, data quality rules, missing
      attributes, and customer exemption validation with workflows and
      approvals.
    - >-
      Compliance calendar and notice management: due dates, reminders, and
      rule-change alerts with one-click re-computation for retroactive rate
      updates.
    - >-
      Audit-ready evidence binder: full data lineage, versioned rules,
      role-based sign-off, and reproducible computations for sampling and
      auditor inquiries.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Close your excise month in 1 day, not 1 week: AI-mapped,
    ship-to-jurisdiction tax computation with filing-ready PDFs/CSVs and an
    audit-proof evidence binder across 50 states + D.C. and key localities.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
