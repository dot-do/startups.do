leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Primary HTS hit lists include high artifact rates (PAINS/aggregators,
      autofluorescence, plate/batch effects), leading to 40–80% false positives
      in confirmatory assays and wasted budget/time.
    - >-
      QSAR models trained on heterogeneous HTS outcomes often fail to
      generalize; lack of uncertainty quantification and applicability-domain
      (AD) awareness causes overconfident, wrong prioritizations.
    - >-
      Teams lack standard, reproducible feature engineering and plate-level QC
      pipelines; manual triage is slow and inconsistent across projects.
    - >-
      Follow-up capacity is constrained; without data-driven enrichment,
      confirmatory testing costs and timelines balloon (weeks to months).
    - >-
      Integration gaps with LIMS/ELN and chemistry toolchains create friction
      and rework; auditability and traceability are insufficient for decision
      reviews.
    - >-
      Limited in-house ML/cheminformatics expertise to build and maintain robust
      models with drift monitoring, AD, and active learning at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated feature engineering for HTS outcomes: chemical
      descriptors/fingerprints, plate/batch covariates, assay-context features,
      artifact/PAINS flags.
    - >-
      Model training with uncertainty: conformal prediction and calibrated
      probabilities to rank by both predicted effect and confidence.
    - >-
      Applicability-domain aware prioritization: distance- and density-based AD
      plus domain-specific covariates to exclude out-of-domain recommendations.
    - >-
      Plate- and batch-effect correction: well/edge effects, signal drift,
      control normalization, and blind-spot detection to reduce artifacts before
      modeling.
    - >-
      Active learning for confirmatory selection: propose minimal, diverse,
      high-value subsets to maximize enrichment per confirmation dollar.
    - >-
      Seamless integration: connectors to common LIMS/ELN (e.g., Dotmatics,
      Benchling), SD file workflows, and cloud/on‑prem deployment with full
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Monitoring and model governance: drift detection, periodic re-training,
      versioning, and traceable decisions for internal reviews and partner
      reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase confirmatory hit rate and reduce wasted assays with
    applicability-domain aware QSAR triage, plate/QC-aware feature engineering,
    and uncertainty-calibrated prioritization—without de novo design or IP risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A production-grade, applicability-domain aware triage stack that jointly
    models chemical, plate, and assay-context features with conformal
    uncertainty—validated on public HTS sets and packaged with integrations and
    governance so teams realize measurable enrichment within one campaign.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Biotech R&D and screening teams who must rapidly triage HTS hits and choose
    confirmatory candidates with confidence and traceability—without de novo
    design.
  problem: >-
    - External: HTS yields thousands of noisy hits with artifacts, PAINS, and
    batch effects while confirmatory budget and time are limited.

    - Internal: Uncertainty and decision fatigue; skepticism of black-box AI;
    pressure to justify selections.

    - Philosophical: Hit selection should be data-driven, transparent, and
    reproducible so good science isn’t derailed by noise.
  guide: >-
    We understand you can’t afford to chase noise or black-box recommendations.
    HTS Hit Triage & QSAR Prioritizer applies proven QSAR, applicability-domain
    estimation, and calibrated uncertainty with transparent validation. Designed
    for NAICS 541714 workflows, we emphasize reproducibility, clear
    documentation, and seamless integration with your cheminformatics stack.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    - Scope & intake: objectives, assay context, controls, plate maps,
    structures, metadata.

    - Curation & features: standardize/annotate compounds, artifact filters,
    plate normalization, rich descriptors/fingerprints.

    - Train & validate: cross-validated QSAR/ML, calibration,
    applicability-domain mapping, bias checks.

    - Prioritize & deliver: rank by confirmability, diversity, and AD coverage;
    provide report + notebook/API.


    Agreement plan:

    - NDA + data governance; you own your data, models, and IP.

    - Secure deployment (on-prem or private cloud).

    - Timeboxed pilot with clear success criteria and acceptance metrics.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Start a 4-week pilot on your latest HTS campaign.
    - Transitional: Request a sample prioritization report and methods brief.
  success: >-
    - Confident, explainable hit lists that respect applicability domain and
    uncertainty.

    - Reduced spend on false positives; more diverse, mechanism-relevant
    chemistry entering confirmation.

    - Faster path from screen to SAR and lead hypotheses.

    - Audit-ready, reproducible decisions that build stakeholder trust and
    momentum.
  failure: >-
    - Budget burned on artifacts and me-too chemotypes.

    - Weeks lost to manual triage and debate; missed competitive windows.
