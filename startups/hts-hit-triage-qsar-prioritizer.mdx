  vision: "Transform HTS hit discovery with AI-driven, uncertainty-aware compound prioritization"
  mission: "Eliminate false positives and accelerate drug discovery through applicability-domain aware QSAR triage"
  purpose: "Higher quality hits, faster confirmatory assays, reduced discovery costs"
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Primary HTS hit lists include high artifact rates (PAINS/aggregators, autofluorescence, plate/batch effects), leading to 40–80% false positives in confirmatory assays and wasted budget/time"
    - "QSAR models trained on heterogeneous HTS outcomes often fail to generalize; lack of uncertainty quantification and applicability-domain (AD) awareness causes overconfident, wrong prioritizations"
    - "Teams lack standard, reproducible feature engineering and plate-level QC pipelines; manual triage is slow and inconsistent across projects"
    - "Follow-up capacity is constrained; without data-driven enrichment, confirmatory testing costs and timelines balloon (weeks to months)"
    - "Integration gaps with LIMS/ELN and chemistry toolchains create friction and rework; auditability and traceability are insufficient for decision reviews"
    - "Limited in-house ML/cheminformatics expertise to build and maintain robust models with drift monitoring, AD, and active learning at scale"
  solution:
    - "Automated feature engineering for HTS outcomes: chemical descriptors/fingerprints, plate/batch covariates, assay-context features, artifact/PAINS flags"
    - "Model training with uncertainty: conformal prediction and calibrated probabilities to rank by both predicted effect and confidence"
    - "Applicability-domain aware prioritization: distance- and density-based AD plus domain-specific covariates to exclude out-of-domain recommendations"
    - "Plate- and batch-effect correction: well/edge effects, signal drift, control normalization, and blind-spot detection to reduce artifacts before modeling"
    - "Active learning for confirmatory selection: propose minimal, diverse, high-value subsets to maximize enrichment per confirmation dollar"
    - "Seamless integration: connectors to common LIMS/ELN (e.g., Dotmatics, Benchling), SD file workflows, and cloud/on‑prem deployment with full audit trails"
    - "Monitoring and model governance: drift detection, periodic re-training, versioning, and traceable decisions for internal reviews and partner reporting"
  uniqueValueProp: "Increase confirmatory hit rate and reduce wasted assays with applicability-domain aware QSAR triage, plate/QC-aware feature engineering, and uncertainty-calibrated prioritization—without de novo design or IP risk"
  unfairAdvantage: "A production-grade, applicability-domain aware triage stack that jointly models chemical, plate, and assay-context features with conformal uncertainty—validated on public HTS sets and packaged with integrations and governance so teams realize measurable enrichment within one campaign"
  customerSegments:
    - "Mid-size biopharma (50–1,000 R&D FTE) running in-house or partnered HTS campaigns seeking higher confirmatory hit quality"
    - "Large pharma therapeutic area teams needing scalable, AD-aware prioritization across multiple screening modalities"
    - "CROs/CDMOs offering HTS and secondary screening that want to boost hit quality and throughput for sponsors"
    - "Academic screening centers and non-profit consortia needing standardized triage and reproducible QSAR for diverse assays"
    - "AI-native or virtual biotechs that do not do de novo design but need robust triage and prioritization of purchased libraries"
  channels:
    - "Direct enterprise sales to mid-size biopharma therapeutic units and CRO BD teams with 6–8 week paid pilots"
    - "Partnerships with CROs to embed triage as a value-add service; revenue share or bundled pricing for sponsors"
    - "Cloud marketplaces (AWS/GCP) listings to ease procurement for VPC deployments"
    - "Co-marketing with LIMS/ELN vendors and cheminformatics tool providers (Benchling, Dotmatics, ChemAxon) via connectors and joint webinars"
    - "Conference presence and workshops at SLAS, BIO, ACS, ELRIG; publish comparative case studies with independent screening centers"
    - "Founder-led thought leadership: benchmarking on public HTS datasets (PubChem, ChEMBL) and reproducible notebooks for credibility"
    - "Targeted outbound to teams with recent HTS publications/grants; ABM campaigns based on disclosed assay modalities and targets"
  revenueStreams:
    - "Subscription SaaS (annual): Starter $60–100k (single team/assay), Pro $120–200k (multi-assay, integrations), Enterprise $250–500k (multi-site, on‑prem/VPC, SSO)"
    - "Usage-based compute/storage overage for large campaigns (e.g., $0.20–0.40 per vCPU-hour, $20–35/TB-month)"
    - "Professional services: onboarding, custom integrations, bespoke model development ($180–250/hour or scoped SOW)"
    - "Paid pilots: $50–75k for 6–8 weeks with predefined success criteria and conversion credits to subscription"
    - "CRO embedded model licensing: annual platform fee plus per-campaign seats; optional success-linked bonus based on confirmed hit uplift"
    - "Training and enablement packages: $5–15k per cohort for internal upskilling and governance workshops"
  costStructure:
    - "Salaries: ML engineers/cheminformaticians, data scientists, software engineers, solutions architects, sales/CS, security/compliance"
