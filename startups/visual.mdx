  problem:
    - >-
      Stamp/label errors (missing AWPA Use Category, retention, plant code,
      third‑party inspector mark) trigger returns, fines, and rework; 0.5–2.0%
      of treated shipments in North America face compliance issues annually,
      costing $150–$600 per affected load.
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection is inconsistent and slow; a single outbound load
      typically requires 20–40 minutes to spot‑check 10–20 bundles, causing
      bottlenecks at gate and late trucks.
    - >-
      Surface defects (excessive checks, splits at ends, crushed corners,
      preservative exudation, wrong end‑tag color coding) are often missed,
      leading to claims and reputational damage with big‑box and utility buyers.
    - >-
      QA documentation is incomplete or non‑auditable; photo evidence is
      scattered across devices, lacking time/GPS stamps and secure trails
      required by third‑party inspectors (e.g., TPI, PFS TECO, SPIB) and large
      retailer/vendor compliance portals.
    - >-
      Treating standards change and vary by customer/spec (AWPA U1/E1 Use
      Categories UC3A/UC3B/UC4A/UC4B, retention levels, preservative type
      CA/ACQ/MCA); line staff struggle to keep acceptance criteria current
      across SKUs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Smartphone app guides the user to capture 3–5 images per bundle
      (stamp/label close‑up, end‑tag, surface overview, ends).
    - >-
      On‑device preprocessing and cloud vision models OCR the stamp/label to
      extract Use Category, preservative, retention, plant code, inspector mark,
      date/lot, and color coding; validates against customer/spec library and
      current AWPA tables.
    - >-
      Computer vision flags surface defects exceeding customer thresholds (e.g.,
      end splits > 1× board thickness or >10% length, crushed edges >10 mm,
      excessive checking by density/area, tag/sticker missing or unreadable).
    - >-
      Real‑time pass/fail with reason codes and corrective prompts (re‑tag,
      reject, rework, re‑inspect); auto‑creates a tamper‑evident audit record
      (GPS/time/user/load, image hashes).
    - >-
      Exports a consolidated inspection report (PDF/CSV/API) linked to load ID
      and packing list; syncs with ERP/yard systems; exceptions routed to
      supervisors with SLA timers.
    - >-
      Dashboards track defect trends by product line, shift, tank, and supplier
      to enable process improvement (e.g., end‑sealing, handling practices).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pocket‑fast, audit‑grade verification for treated wood: instant smartphone
    checks of stamps and surface defects, mapped to AWPA/contract specs, with
    tamper‑evident photo trails and ERP integration—cut inspection time by 60%
    and reduce shipment claims by 50%+ within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    (stamps, retention levels, Use Categories) co‑developed with inspection
    agencies and early adopter plants, plus tamper‑evident audit trails that
    meet third‑party audit requirements—hard for generic vision or horizontal QA
    apps to replicate quickly.
