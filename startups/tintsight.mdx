  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers struggle to choose paint/wallpaper colors and finishes from
      online chips or in-store swatches; decision paralysis reduces conversion
      and delays purchase.
    - >-
      Retailers lack brand-agnostic, high-fidelity visualization that maps to
      real SKUs and finishes; existing tools are either manufacturer-locked or
      not integrated with cart/POS.
    - >-
      High sample costs (sample pots, peel-and-stick) and high return/exchange
      rates due to color mismatch and finish selection errors.
    - >-
      Inconsistent associate expertise across stores leads to uneven
      recommendations and lost sales, especially during peak traffic.
    - >-
      Ecommerce for paint/wallpaper has poor UX for configuration (coverage,
      quantities, tools), resulting in low online conversion and low attach
      rates.
    - >-
      Retailers have limited data on shoppers’ color intent and project scope,
      reducing effectiveness of follow-ups and marketing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload-or-scan photo; AI segments surfaces, normalizes lighting, and
      recommends 3–5 palettes and 2–3 finish options per surface based on room
      context and retailer’s catalog.
    - >-
      Real-time visualization (photo + optional live AR) with accurate color
      mapping (ΔE ≤ 2.0 target) and texture/finish rendering (matte, eggshell,
      satin, semi-gloss).
    - >-
      Cart-ready bundles: auto-calculate coverage, primer need,
      tape/rollers/brushes, paste/liners for wallpaper; 1-click add-to-cart or
      quote request.
    - >-
      Brand-agnostic SKU mapping: supports multiple paint/wallpaper brands with
      store-controlled assortments and pricing; honors MAP and dealer
      exclusives.
    - >-
      Lead capture and follow-up: email/text of mockups, saved palettes, sample
      options; pushes to CRM/POS for reminders and associate follow-up.
    - >-
      In-store kiosk mode with QR handoff to shopper’s phone; printable or
      digital project sheet for pros/clients.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase paint/wallpaper conversion 10–25% with photo-based color and finish
    recommendations that instantly visualize on the shopper’s room and convert
    to cart-ready, quantity-accurate bundles—brand-agnostic, store-branded, and
    integrated to POS/ecommerce.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Brand-agnostic, SKU-accurate visualization with proprietary
    spectral-to-display color mapping and finish-aware rendering, integrated
    directly to cart/POS with coverage/bundle logic—and co-op-enabled
    distribution via paint brands and dealer networks.
