  problem:
    - >-
      Quoting inaccuracy: cycle time estimates often vary ±20–40%, leading to
      lost bids or margin erosion.
    - >-
      Inconsistent feeds/speeds rely on tribal knowledge; parameter selection
      changes by programmer/shift and isn’t captured systemically.
    - >-
      Suboptimal cutting conditions increase cycle time by 10–30% and tool costs
      by 5–15%.
    - >-
      Difficulty selecting the right tool for a
      feature/material/tolerance/finish, especially for small shops with diverse
      work.
    - >-
      Manual iteration to meet tolerance and surface finish targets (Ra)
      increases programming time and trials on the machine.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop learning from actual production data (tool wear,
      spindle load, alarms), so settings don’t improve over time.
    - >-
      Vendor calculators are biased to their tool families and not integrated
      with CAM, machine limits, or shop constraints.
    - >-
      High-mix/low-volume turning makes it hard to standardize process
      parameters across materials (e.g., 4140, 17-4PH, Inconel).
  solution:
    - >-
      CAM-integrated AI recommender for turning: suggests tool, SFM (G96/G97),
      feed/rev, depth of cut (ap), multi-pass strategies (rough/finish) per
      feature (OD/ID, face, groove, thread, bore, drill).
    - >-
      Optimization modes: Throughput (maximize MRR within power, rigidity, and
      chatter limits) and Cost (minimize cost/part factoring tool life, insert
      cost, and changeover).
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML: blends machining physics (cutting force, power,
      temperature, chip thinning, stability lobes) with empirical data from
      actual runs (spindle load, tool life, scrap).
    - >-
      Cycle time estimator: per-operation and part-level time with setup, tool
      changes, and probing; accuracy target ±10% after calibration.
    - >-
      Tolerance/finish-aware: maps GD&T and Ra to recommended nose radius,
      insert grade/geometry, lead angle, and finishing passes.
    - >-
      Risk scoring: confidence score per recommendation; guardrails for small
      diameters/overhangs, interrupted cuts, hard materials, thin walls.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingests machine and tool-wear data to auto-tune
      recommendations by material, tool, and machine model.
    - >-
      Tooling marketplace integration: cross-vendor catalogs (Sandvik,
      Kennametal, Seco, Iscar, Walter, etc.) with in-stock/lead time filters.
    - >-
      Quoting workflow: exports costed cycle times with markup, machine rate,
      and tool amortization to ERP/CPQ; scenario compare by machine/cell.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins: Mastercam, Fusion 360, Esprit, Siemens NX; ERP/MES
      connectors; optional on-prem gateway for air-gapped shops.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    1-click, data-driven turning parameters and cycle-time digital twin that
    chooses the right tool, feeds/speeds, and pass strategy per feature to hit
    tolerance/finish at lowest cost or highest throughput—improving quoting
    accuracy to within ±8–10% and cutting average cycle time by 10–20% within 60
    days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, physics-informed ML trained on real production turning data
    across multiple shops and tool brands—embedded directly in CAM and quoting

  character: >-
    Process planners, CNC programmers, and estimators at precision turned‑part
    manufacturers who must hit cost and delivery on high‑mix turning.
  problem: >-
    Choosing tools and feeds/speeds per feature and estimating cycle time is
    slow and inconsistent across materials and machines—creating quote risk,
    delays, and margin erosion. It shouldn’t require tribal knowledge to make
    good machining decisions.

    Cycle‑Time + Cutting Parameter Recommender (Turning) is your AI
    guide—trained on cutting data, tooling catalogs, and shop constraints—to
    deliver proven, physics‑aware recommendations with clear rationale.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload part/CAD or features, material, machine, and tooling library. 2)
    Get per‑feature tool picks, feeds/speeds, and cycle‑time with cost vs.
    throughput optimization. 3) Validate and export to CAM/Machine; start with a
    low‑risk pilot and ROI review.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14‑day pilot or book a 30‑min demo. Transitional: Download a
    sample report and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Confident quotes, consistent parameters, 10–30% faster cycles, higher
    throughput and OEE, fewer crashes/scrap, captured know‑how, on‑time
    delivery, and stronger margins.
  failure: >-
    Avoid late jobs, over/under‑machining, tool breakage, rework,
    tribal‑knowledge bottlenecks, and profit bleed from inconsistent cutting
    parameters.
