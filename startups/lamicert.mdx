  problem:
    - >-
      Manual creation of CoAs and compliance packs consumes 30–90 minutes per
      order, tying up 1–3 FTEs per plant and delaying shipments.
    - >-
      Supplier raw-material CoAs arrive in varied formats (PDF scans, emails,
      portals), causing data-entry errors and mismatches to internal specs and
      customer-specific requirements.
    - >-
      Keeping regulatory statements current (REACH SVHC updates, RoHS
      exemptions, UL Yellow Card status, Prop 65, aerospace flammability) is
      error-prone and scattered across SharePoint folders and spreadsheets.
    - >-
      ERP/LIMS/MES systems rarely produce customer-specific CoAs and pack
      bundles without heavy customization; custom code is brittle and costly to
      maintain.
    - >-
      Audit readiness is weak: incomplete traceability, missing supplier CoAs,
      inconsistent version control, and poor e-signature/audit trail practices.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly demand digital submissions (portal/EDI) and faster
      turnaround; missed SLAs trigger chargebacks and supplier scorecard hits.
    - >-
      High mix/low volume orders require frequent template changes by customer,
      region, and application (automotive, aerospace, electrical), creating
      template sprawl and rework.
    - >-
      Quality teams lack visibility into right-first-time rates, document
      currency, and cycle time KPIs to drive continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered ingestion of supplier CoAs, test results, and regulatory
      statements from PDFs, emails, and portals; high-accuracy OCR and structure
      extraction tailored to plastics industry formats.
    - >-
      Rules engine maps data to customer-specific templates and tolerances;
      validates against internal specs, BOM composition, and regulatory
      requirements (REACH/RoHS/UL).
    - >-
      Automated CoA and compliance pack assembly (PDF/JSON/EDI) per order,
      including e-signatures, audit trails, and customer delivery via email,
      portal, or EDI/API.
    - >-
      Real-time regulatory content management: track SVHC changes, RoHS
      exemptions, UL Yellow Card statuses; notify of impact and auto-update
      statements.
    - >-
      Dashboards/KPIs: cycle time, right-first-time, supplier coverage, document
      currency, and audit readiness scores.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box connectors for SAP/Oracle/Epicor/Plex/QAD, common LIMS
      (LabWare/LabVantage), and lab instruments for direct test result
      ingestion.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate customer-specific CoAs and audit-ready compliance packs in minutes,
    not hours—97% straight-through automation, 70% cycle-time reduction, and a
    single source of truth for REACH/RoHS/UL statements, with seamless
    ERP/LIMS/MES integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized plastics-focused document AI trained on thousands of supplier
    CoA formats and OEM-approved templates, coupled with prebuilt integrations
    and a curated regulatory content library (UL/REACH/RoHS). Network effects
    improve extraction accuracy and template coverage as more suppliers and
    customers onboard, creating a defensible data moat and faster time-to-value
    than generic QMS/LIMS or custom ERP solutions.

    QA/Compliance leaders at laminated plastics plate, sheet (except packaging),
    and shape manufacturers who must deliver customer‑specific CoAs and
    compliance packs quickly and accurately.
  problem: >-
    External: CoAs and compliance packs are manually assembled from test
    results, supplier CoAs, and REACH/RoHS/UL statements across changing specs
    and customer formats. Internal: You worry about missed line items, version
    mistakes, and shipment delays. Philosophical: Quality products shouldn’t be
    held back by paperwork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the stress of audits, OEM demands, and last‑minute document
    requests. Authority: Built with plastics compliance experts; aligns with ISO
    workflows; integrates with LIMS/ERP; supports REACH, RoHS, UL files; proven
    in laminated plastics operations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data sources and ingest supplier CoAs and regulatory statements.
    2) Configure specs, customer templates, and rules per SKU, lot, and region.
    3) Auto‑compile, review, e‑sign, and deliver CoAs and compliance packs with
    full traceability. You stay in control—AI drafts, you approve.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download
    sample CoA/compliance templates and the audit‑readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Same‑day CoAs, audit‑ready documentation, faster releases, fewer holds,
    higher customer confidence, and a searchable compliance record across lots,
    SKUs, and customers.
  failure: >-
    Manual compilation persists, causing rework, audit findings, shipment holds,
    compliance risk, and lost business when customers demand proof.
