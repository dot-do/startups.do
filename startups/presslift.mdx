leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Low CTR on article cards, homepages, and newsletters due to suboptimal
      headlines/decks; typical baseline CTR variance by editor/style >30%.
    - >-
      Inconsistent or missing SEO metadata (title, description, schema) harms
      crawlability and SERP CTR, especially for time-sensitive news.
    - >-
      Manual headline brainstorming and testing consumes 5–15 minutes per story
      and rarely includes structured A/B testing due to tooling and time
      constraints.
    - >-
      Experimentation is ad hoc; lack of statistically valid tests leads to
      noisy decisions and missed compounding gains.
    - >-
      Integration friction: generic A/B tools add latency, require engineering
      time, or break CMS/workflows; newsrooms need “editor-first” tools.
    - >-
      Editorial trust and brand voice concerns with AI outputs; legal/compliance
      risks (hallucinations, sensitive topics) deter adoption.
    - >-
      Publishers struggle to quantify ROI per experiment and translate uplift
      into revenue/subscription outcomes.
  solution:
    - >-
      LLM-assisted variant generation for headlines, decks, and meta tags
      triggered within CMS; respects style guides, banned terms, and tone per
      section.
    - >-
      Real-time CTR propensity and SEO visibility scoring using publisher
      historical data and news-topic features.
    - >-
      One-click A/B/n and multi-armed bandit testing on headlines/decks for
      article pages, homepages, and section fronts.
    - >-
      Automated SEO metadata optimization (title length, entities, schema, news
      sitemaps, canonical hints) with rollbacks and approvals.
    - >-
      Edge-based experiment delivery (CDN workers) to avoid origin latency; no
      client-side flicker.
    - >-
      Unified analytics tying uplift to outcomes (subscriber conversions, ad
      revenue proxies, engaged minutes).
    - >-
      Governance: human-in-the-loop review, audit log, topic sensitivity
      filters, and brand safety guardrails.
    - Multilingual support for bilingual markets and international desks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase article CTR by 8–15% and organic SERP clicks by 5–12% within 90
    days by generating, scoring, and A/B testing headline, deck, and SEO
    metadata variants that match your stylebook—integrated directly in your CMS
    with <20 ms added latency and full editorial governance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Newsroom-tuned scoring models plus an edge-based experiment delivery that
    adds <20 ms latency, combined with deep CMS plugins and governance designed
    for editors. Over time, aggregated anonymized performance data across
    beats/sections produces superior priors and faster wins that generic A/B or
    writing tools cannot match.
