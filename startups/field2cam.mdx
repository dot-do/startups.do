  title: Field Template QA & CAM-Ready Prep
  description: >-
    Cleans and validates laser templates, applies shop standards, and outputs
    CAM-ready DXF plus a checklist.
  targetUsers:
    - Templaters
    - CAD/CAM programmers
    - Production managers
  triggers:
    - New template files uploaded
    - Template fails CAM checks

    - Laser template files (DXF/CSV/PCD)
    - 'Shop standards (overhangs, radii, seam rules)'
    - Sink/faucet model library
    - Backsplash and edge profile preferences
  steps:
    - Ingest and validate geometry; detect gaps/self-intersections
    - >-
      Auto-apply overhang, corner radii, wall offsets; flag out-of-tolerance
      conditions
    - Place sinks/faucets from library; check clearances
    - Suggest seam locations and support requirements
    - 'Generate clean layers, labels, and notes; export CAM-ready DXF'
    - Produce QA checklist for human sign-off
  tools:
    - ezdxf/Shapely
    - Rule engine for shop standards
    - Parts library management
    - Optional APS viewer for markup
  outputs:
    - Cleaned DXF with layers by operation

  pricingModel:
    - Per template file
    - Monthly subscription + usage
    - Setup fee to encode shop standards

  problem:
    - >-
      Field laser templates arrive noisy (gaps, duplicate lines, splines vs
      arcs, mislayered entities, mixed units), taking 10–25 minutes per top to
      clean before CAM and causing avoidable shop downtime.
    - >-
      Shop standards (overhangs, edge profiles, sink reveals, minimum corner
      radii, miter angles, faucet spacing, rodding rules) are applied
      inconsistently by different drafters, leading to variability and remakes.
    - >-
      Machine/CAM mappings differ by cell (layer names, colors, tool codes,
      compensation), and exporting the same job to Park, BACA, Breton, or
      waterjet often requires tedious remapping and rechecking.
    - >-
      Critical QA checks (closed polylines, min tool radius, collision/kerf
      relief, slab size fit, backsplash logic, appliance clearances) are not
      systematically enforced, increasing risk of field return trips and scrap.
    - >-
      Communication gaps between templaters, drafters, and shop floor lead to
      missing notes/photos, version-control confusion, and incomplete job
      packets.
    - >-
      Hiring/training experienced CAD drafters is hard; variability and ramp-up
      time slow throughput during growth spurts or seasonality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest DXF/DWG from LPI/Prodim/Faro and normalize geometry (units, layers,
      splines→arcs, join, dedupe).
    - >-
      Rules engine encodes shop standards (overhangs, edge profiles, min radii,
      sink reveals, faucet spacing, miter logic, rodding, backsplash).
    - >-
      AI feature recognition snaps sinks/cooktops/fixtures to a curated library
      with manufacturer offsets and clearances.
    - >-
      One-click export profiles per machine/CAM (layer/color/tool code mapping
      for Park, BACA/Easystone, Breton, Alphacam, Slabsmith, Intermac, Flow).
    - >-
      Digital QA checklist with severity scores, annotated screenshots, and
      sign-offs; outputs PDF/JSON attached to job in ERP.
    - >-
      Dashboard quantifies time saved, common violations, checklist completion,
      and correlations with remake rate; alerts for outliers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn noisy field laser templates into shop-standard, machine-ready DXFs with
    an auditable QA checklist in under 60 seconds—cutting CAD cleanup time by
    70–90% and reducing remake incidents by 30–50%, vendor-neutral across
    templating systems and CNC/CAM stacks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-vendor template dataset tied to observed shop outcomes (time-to-CAM,
    remake incidents) enabling machine-specific rule packs and predictive QA;
    deep integrations with LPI/Prodim, Moraware/ActionFlow, and major CNC/CAM
    stacks; ‘CAM-ready or we fix it’ SLA with audited checklists builds trust
    and switching costs; on-prem/air-gapped connector meets security-sensitive
    shops others can’t serve.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Stone fabrication shops (NAICS 327991)—CAD/CAM leads, templaters, and
    production managers who need every field template clean and CAM‑ready to
    keep sawjets and routers on schedule.
  problem: >-
    External: Laser templates arrive messy—splines, gaps/duplicates, wrong
    layers, open polylines, off‑standard overhangs and sink/faucet layouts.
    Internal: Hours lost fixing files, bottlenecks before cut, remakes, and
    missed install windows. Philosophical: Craftsmen should build stone, not
    babysit bad geometry; machines should cut, not wait.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived the 5 pm template crunch. Our AI service cleans and validates
    laser templates, applies your shop standards by material/edge/appliance, and
    returns CAM‑ready DXF plus a QC checklist. Proven on thousands of shop files
    and designed to drop into your existing DXF‑based CAM workflow.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload DXF/DWG from your laser capture. 2) AI auto‑corrects and
    validates: layer map, arc‑fit, close polylines, radii, offsets, seams,
    sink/faucet rules—then outputs CAM‑ready DXF with a change log checklist. 3)
    Review, approve, and push straight to sawjet/router. Options: per‑shop
    standards, SLA, secure handling.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial—upload 5 templates today. Transitional: Book a
    15‑minute onboarding or download a before/after DXF and sample checklist.
  success: >-
    Predictable throughput, standardized CAM‑ready files, fewer remakes, on‑time
    installs, more slabs per shift, and a QC audit trail that keeps crews
    aligned and machines cutting.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: idle machines, overtime, re‑templating trips, chipped
    parts and misfits, chargebacks, and blown lead times due to bad geometry and
    inconsistent standards.
