leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      End-to-end lot genealogy is fragmented across ERP, MES/SCADA, QA
      spreadsheets, and paper travelers, causing hours-to-days of manual
      trace-back during incidents.
    - >-
      Blending, rework, repack, and kitting operations break lineage, making it
      hard to propagate “suspect lot” flags from components
      (powder/primer/brass/bullets/packaging) to finished goods and shipped
      pallets.
    - >-
      Recall packages (affected SKUs, lot ranges, customers, COAs, shipping
      ASNs, plant records) take days to assemble, delaying containment,
      increasing liability and costs.
    - >-
      Quality escapes are detected late; without continuous monitoring, suspect
      component lots may pass multiple work centers and ship before detection.
    - >-
      Audit and contract compliance (ISO 9001/NIST 800-171/CMMC/ITAR, SAAMI
      conformance) require provable traceability and immutable records that are
      costly to produce on demand.
    - >-
      Smaller and mid-sized manufacturers lack internal data engineering
      resources to build and maintain robust, validated genealogy and
      recall-readiness systems.
    - >-
      Retailer/distributor-specific recall communication and
      proof-of-notification are manual and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Event-driven genealogy engine that captures every material transformation
      (receive → stage → blend → load → test → pack → ship), maintaining lineage
      through blends/rework/returns.
    - >-
      AI-assisted data reconciliation that infers missing links, flags anomalies
      (out-of-sequence travelers, off-route material, yield anomalies), and
      auto-corrects common data entry errors with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Continuous suspect-lot propagation: when a component lot is flagged, the
      system computes all affected WIP/finished goods/pallets/customers in near
      real time and triggers containment workflows.
    - >-
      One-click Recall Package Builder: compiles affected SKUs and lots,
      COAs/COCs, QC/ballistics test data, batch records, traveler scans,
      shipping ASNs/EDIs, customer lists, and regulator-facing templates within
      minutes.
    - >-
      Recall Drill Simulator: runs quarterly tabletop drills against real plant
      data; produces time-stamped readiness scorecards for auditors and
      insurers.
    - >-
      Secure integrations: connectors for ERP/MES/SCADA/LIMS/WMS, PLC data via
      OPC UA/MQTT, barcode/RFID/vision systems; on-prem or GovCloud deployment
      to meet ITAR/CMMC requirements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Sub-minute lot trace and sub-60-minute recall packages for ammunition
    manufacturers. Continuous suspect-lot monitoring that propagates through
    blends, rework, and shipments—delivered in an ITAR-compliant,
    factory-integrated platform. Reduce recall-response time by 90%+, shrink
    recall scope by 30–60%, and cut genealogy admin labor by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    An ammunition-specific genealogy ontology and propagation engine pre-tuned
    for blends/rework and ballistics test data, plus a growing, anonymized
    dataset of recall drills and incident patterns across plants. Combined with
    certified connectors and ITAR-compliant deployment options, this yields
    faster time-to-value and proven recall-readiness benchmarks competitors
    lack.

  problem: >-
    - Villain: Fragmented data and manual traceability create blind spots.

    - External: Mixed components, subcontracted processes, and supplier
    variability make lot genealogy hard.

    - Internal: Anxiety about not finding suspect rounds fast and triggering
    brand-damaging, costly recalls.

    - Philosophical: Manufacturers should focus on making safe, reliable
    ammunition—not chasing spreadsheets.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure to prove control over every lot,
    answer audits quickly, and keep customers safe.

    - Authority: Built by manufacturing data specialists with defense and QMS
    experience; integrates with existing ERP/MES/QMS to deliver minute-level lot
    genealogy and rapid recall packs.
  plan: >-
    - Process plan: 1) Connect data (ERP/MES/QMS/LIMS, machine counters,
    supplier COAs) 2) Auto-build end-to-end genealogy with component-to-finished
    mapping 3) Monitor, flag suspect lots, and generate a complete recall
    package in minutes.

    - Agreement plan: Security-by-design with role-based access; cloud or
    on‑prem options; low-lift pilot and clear success criteria before full
    rollout.
