  problem:
    - >-
      High cost and long turnaround times (24–96 hours) for multilingual
      captions/subtitles across large catalogs and day-and-date releases
    - >-
      Inconsistent quality and style compliance across vendors and languages;
      frequent rejections by OTT platforms due to timing, CPS, and line-length
      violations
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone packaging and delivery (IMSC1/TTML/SCC/VTT/SRT) to
      disparate ingest specs (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, broadcasters)
    - >-
      Scaling issues for spikes in demand (marketing cutdowns, seasonal drops,
      catalog refreshes) without predictable SLAs
    - >-
      Security/compliance concerns when sending pre-release content to large
      freelancer pools; need for SOC 2/GDPR-compliant processing and
      watermarking
    - >-
      Lack of centralized QC and automated checks; too much human review for
      basic style issues, speaker IDs, SDH tags, and profanity rules
    - >-
      Poor diarization and domain terminology handling leads to audible/visual
      mismatch and brand risk
    - >-
      Inefficient versioning across platforms (frame rates, safe areas, burnt-in
      vs sidecar, CEA-608/708 embedding)
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-first pipeline: ASR with domain-adapted language models + diarization +
      SDH enrichment (music, sound effects, profanity)
    - >-
      Neural MT with custom glossaries and translation memories per client/show;
      LLM-based context repair and punctuation
    - >-
      Automated QC/style engine mapping Netflix, Amazon, Disney, BBC, EBU, FCC
      79.1, and client-specific rules (CPS, CPL, line breaks, timing)
    - >-
      One-click packaging and delivery to IMSC1, TTML, DFXP, WebVTT, SRT,
      SCC/MCC, STL, SMPTE-TT; IMF and MXF caption embedding
    - >-
      Live and near-live captioning with <3s latency; automatic handoff to human
      captioners for critical events
    - >-
      Secure processing in client-dedicated VPCs, watermarking, and role-based
      access; SOC 2 Type II roadmap and GDPR compliance
    - >-
      Collaboration UI with version control, frame-accurate timeline,
      shot-change segmentation, and human post-editing
    - >-
      APIs/SDKs for MAM/CMS integration (Avid, Adobe, Resolve,
      Telestream/Vantage, AWS MediaConvert, Aspera/Signiant)
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: WER/CER, style compliance, TAT, on-time delivery,
      rejection rate, per-language quality scores
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Broadcast-compliant multilingual captions and subtitles delivered 2–5x
    faster and 30–50% cheaper, with automated style/QC, secure delivery to every
    platform format, and human-in-the-loop quality where it matters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, standards-encoded style/QC engine plus LLM auto-correction
    that consistently passes major OTT acceptance tests out-of-the-box, combined
    with deep delivery integrations (IMF/IMSC1/608/708) and private-VPC
    security—reducing rejections and legal risk while enabling true one-click
    delivery at scale.
