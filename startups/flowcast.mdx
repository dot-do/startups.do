leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable rider demand by zone/time drives long ETAs (8–12 min during
      peaks) and high cancellations (8–15% in many cities).
    - >-
      Drivers cluster in visible hotspots instead of future hotspots, causing
      deadheading and low driver utilization (25–40% idle time).
    - >-
      Incentive spend is blunt (system-wide surge/bonuses), leading to 4–12% of
      driver earnings spent on inefficient incentives with unclear ROI.
    - >-
      Dispatch systems lack fine-grained, real-time forecasts (by 250–500m
      tiles, 5–15 min horizon) and a closed-loop way to stage supply and test
      incentive effectiveness.
    - >-
      External signals (events, weather, transit disruptions) are not
      operationalized quickly, so fleets are reactive rather than proactive.
    - >-
      Operators lack A/B testing and off-policy evaluation frameworks to
      quantify ETA/cancellation improvements and savings from targeted
      incentives.
  solution:
    - >-
      City-scale demand forecasts at 250–500m tiles, 5–15 minute intervals,
      rolling 24–72 hours; blended with live telemetry to produce dynamic supply
      gaps.
    - >-
      Driver staging recommendations (heatmaps + ranked staging zones) pushed
      via API/SDK into driver apps; compliance nudges and routing to staging
      zones.
    - >-
      Incentive Optimizer: micro-bonuses by tile/time/driver cohort sized to
      close supply gaps at minimum cost; includes budget guardrails and fairness
      controls.
    - >-
      Shift & break scheduling recommender for fleets with contracted drivers to
      align on-duty hours with forecasted peaks.
    - >-
      Event/weather/transit disruption ingestion (e.g., PredictHQ + weather
      APIs) for demand uplift factors; automatic anomaly detection for pop-ups.
    - >-
      Experimentation toolkit: city-level A/B or multi-armed bandit tests;
      off-policy evaluation to compute counterfactual savings and KPI lifts.
    - >-
      Integrations: REST/GraphQL APIs, webhooks, and SDK to plug into dispatch,
      pricing/surge modules, and driver apps; dashboards for ops/analytics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut ETAs and cancellations by predicting demand at street-tile resolution
    and proactively positioning supply with targeted micro-incentives—delivering
    measurable ROI in 8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization that pairs high-resolution forecasts with incentive
    and staging levers, validated by off-policy evaluation and rapid A/B tests.
    Cross-city learning and event/weather uplift models improve fast in new
    markets, and integrations with major dispatch platforms create distribution
    advantages and switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Marketplace Ops/Dispatch leader at a taxi or ridesharing network who must
    put the right number of drivers in the right zones at the right times to cut
    ETAs and cancellations.
  problem: >-
    External: Demand spikes vary by zone/time; drivers idle in the wrong places;
    long ETAs, cancellations, and blunt incentive spend.

    Internal: Ops teams are stuck firefighting; drivers distrust staging
    guidance; riders abandon when waits are long.

    Philosophical: People shouldn’t wait for rides when data can position
    drivers ahead of demand.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve felt the pain of missed surges, empty miles, and unhappy
    riders.

    Authority: AI built for mobility—city-scale demand forecasting and supply
    positioning that integrates with your dispatch and driver apps, with clear
    KPIs and transparent models.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Connect: Trip history, driver pings, zones, events, and weather via
    API/S3.

    2) Forecast & simulate: Rolling zone/time demand, supply gaps, and incentive
    scenarios.

    3) Act & learn: Push staging zones and shift bonuses; track ETAs, cancels,
    and ROI.

    Agreement:

    - Pilot one city with shared success targets (ETA, cancellations, incentive
    ROI).

    - Keep your data; no lock-in; cancel anytime.

  success: >-
    Shorter ETAs, fewer cancellations, higher driver utilization and earnings,
    optimized incentive spend, happier riders, and steadier market growth.
  failure: >-
    Keep reacting to surges, waste incentives, suffer long waits and
    cancellations, churn drivers and riders, and lose share to faster
    competitors.
