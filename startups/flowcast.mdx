  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable passenger surges create long queues at security/immigration,
      causing SLA breaches (e.g., >20 min at standard checkpoints, >30 min at
      immigration) and passenger dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Staffing is scheduled using static templates and gut feel, not demand;
      results in 10–25% overtime and idle time swings, driving up cost per
      screened passenger.
    - >-
      Data needed to forecast demand (flight schedules, load factors, real-time
      gate changes, connection banks, curbside arrivals, wait-time sensors) is
      siloed across multiple systems (AODB, airline feeds, sensor vendors) and
      not normalized.
    - >-
      Operational leaders lack actionable, lane-level staffing guidance that
      respects labor rules (certifications, breaks, minimum posts, union
      constraints) and infrastructure constraints (lane capacity, mix of
      standard/PreCheck/priority).
    - >-
      Disruption events (IRROPS, weather, ATC delays, diverted flights) and
      macro seasonality (holidays, cruise spikes) aren’t reflected fast enough
      in staffing plans.
    - >-
      Procurement risk: airports need auditable, privacy-safe solutions with
      proven ROI, integrations, and security certifications; many AI tools lack
      these.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and normalization: AODB/operational schedule (SSIM/AIDX),
      real-time flight updates (gate/ETD/ETA), historical throughput,
      airline-provided load factors when available, sensor data
      (Bluetooth/Wi‑Fi, LiDAR/camera counters), cruise/charter calendars,
      weather/ATC advisories.
    - >-
      Demand forecasting: ML models produce lane-level arrival forecasts in 5–15
      minute intervals, horizon from next 2 hours up to 90 days; adaptive
      learning handles seasonality and events; target accuracy: SMAPE ≤12% at
      15-min, ≤8% hourly after 6 weeks of calibration.
    - >-
      Staffing optimization: Mixed-integer solver translates demand forecasts
      into lane openings and staff rosters respecting labor rules
      (certifications, min/max posts, breaks, relief, training), equipment
      constraints, and service tier targets; outputs actionable rosters and lane
      plans.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: planners test scenarios (IRROPS, extra A380, staff
      call-outs) and see forecasted queues, SLA risk, and incremental staffing
      costs in seconds.
    - >-
      Live operations copilot: alerting when forecast vs actual diverges;
      dynamic recommendations (open/close lanes, redeploy staff) with quantified
      SLA impact; integrates with radio/ops chat and displays on control room
      dashboards.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations: connectors to SITA/Amadeus AODB,
      OAG/Cirium/FlightAware, queue sensors (Xovis, iinside, Veovo), WFM
      (UKG/Kronos, Quinyx), digital signage/wait-time systems; export to payroll
      and BI.
    - >-
      Governance, privacy, and audit: PII-minimized data flows, role-based
      access, decision audit trails, SOC 2 Type II/ISO 27001, data residency
      options; union rule libraries versioned and co-signed with HR/ops.
    - >-
      Deployment playbook: 8–12 week onboarding, including historical data
      backfill, sensor calibration, model tuning, and joint success plan with
      baselined KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast passenger arrivals by lane and 15-minute interval, then recommend
    auditable, union-compliant staffing plans that cut queue peaks and labor
    waste—improving SLA compliance 10–20 pp and reducing overtime 10–25% within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-airport training data plus a library of codified union/labor and
    infrastructure constraints enables faster, more accurate forecasts and
    compliant staffing plans than generic WFM or analytics tools. Pre-built
    connectors to leading AODB, sensor, and WFM systems reduce implementation
    time to under 12 weeks, and audited decision trails meet airport governance
    requirements.

  character: >-
    Airport ops and checkpoint/immigration leaders who must keep lines moving,
    meet SLAs, and staff efficiently.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable passenger surges and static rosters cause misaligned staffing,
    long queues, missed SLAs, and frustrated travelers and agents.
  guide: >-
    We understand airport ops pressure and bring aviation expertise with
    purpose-built AI that turns flight, arrival, and checkpoint data into
    accurate, explainable forecasts and lane-level staffing recommendations.
  plan: >-
    Connect your flight/arrival/checkpoint data, calibrate and validate on
    recent days, then go live with 15-minute lane forecasts and interval
    staffing via dashboards and alerts. Start with a low-risk pilot at one
    checkpoint, then scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute demo or launch a 60-day pilot to see results on your
    lanes.
  success: >-
    Right staff, right place, right time: shorter queues, consistent SLA
    compliance, lower overtime, smoother connections, and higher passenger
    satisfaction backed by auditable plans.
  failure: >-
    Without it, staffing stays reactive: long lines, missed flights, penalties,
    burnout, and poor traveler experience.
