leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual microscopy segmentation and flow cytometry gating are slow and
      variable: a typical 8–12-color flow panel takes 2–6 hours to QC,
      compensate, gate, and report; a 3D microscopy assay can take 1–3 days to
      segment, extract features, and build figures.
    - >-
      High-dimensional datasets (imaging z-stacks, multiplex IF, spectral flow,
      CyTOF) outpace analyst bandwidth, causing bottlenecks and backlog in R&D
      timelines.
    - >-
      Reproducibility and auditability are weak in many labs: inconsistent
      pipelines, undocumented parameter tweaks, missing provenance, and limited
      traceability for sponsor or internal QA reviews.
    - >-
      Shortage of expert analysts increases risk of analysis errors and delays,
      especially in smaller biotech firms without core facilities.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain (FlowJo/Cytobank/OMIQ + CellProfiler/QuPath/Imaris +
      ad-hoc Python/R) increases handoff friction, file conversion errors, and
      version drift.
    - >-
      Regulated/sponsor-backed research requires audit-ready outputs (ALCOA+, 21
      CFR Part 11-style controls, immutable audit trails, e-signatures), which
      most research tools don’t natively support.
    - >-
      Data governance constraints (PII/PHI adjacency, IP sensitivity, data
      residency) limit use of generic cloud AI tools; many teams need
      on-prem/VPC options.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified AI analysis workspace for microscopy and flow data: ingest FCS
      2.0/3.0, OME-TIFF/OME-NGFF/Zarr; run automated QC, segmentation,
      compensation, and gating suggestions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: uncertainty overlays, interactive edits, and
      one-click acceptance/rejection; all actions captured in an immutable audit
      trail with versioned pipelines and parameters.
    - >-
      Pre-validated pipeline templates for common assays (e.g., PBMC immune
      phenotyping, apoptosis/cell cycle, cytokine profiling, tumor
      microenvironment, organoids, HCS) with documented performance and
      acceptance criteria.
    - >-
      Built-in QC: doublet/viability checks, signal drift/clog detection, batch
      effect correction (e.g., Harmony/ComBat), outlier flagging, and spectral
      unmixing recommendations.
    - >-
      Audit-ready reporting: ALCOA+ data integrity, e-signatures, role-based
      approvals, parameter provenance, environment hashes, and exportable
      PDF/JSON reports acceptable to QA/sponsors.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS with regional data residency, VPC
      single-tenant, or on-prem appliance; SSO/SAML, SCIM, and granular RBAC.
    - >-
      Integrations: ELN/LIMS (e.g., Benchling, LabKey), storage (S3/ADLS),
      instrument data streams (BD, Beckman Coulter, Thermo Fisher, Sony,
      Miltenyi), and scripting SDK (Python/R) for custom analytics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One platform that automates microscopy segmentation, feature extraction, and

    outputs—reducing analysis time by 50–80% while improving reproducibility and
    compliance across R&D programs.
