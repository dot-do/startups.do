  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as messy PDFs, emails, and drawings; manual parsing takes
      30–120 minutes per RFQ and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Estimators struggle to map specifications to NEMA grades (e.g., G-10/FR-4,
      CE, LE), UL 94 ratings, and supplier-specific equivalents, causing delays
      and misquotes.
    - >-
      Scrap/yield on cut-to-size panels and nesting is estimated heuristically;
      underestimating waste erodes margin, overestimating loses deals.
    - >-
      Lead times are inconsistent due to press capacity, cure times, machining
      queue, and material availability; customers want reliable options with
      expedite pricing.
    - >-
      Expert knowledge sits with a few senior estimators; turnover or retirement
      creates risk and throughput bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly require multi-quantity, multi-material, and
      alternate-substitute options; generating these variants manually is slow.
    - >-
      Clarifying questions are sent late or incompletely, increasing cycle time
      and reducing win rate.
    - >-
      Compliance and documentation (UL file numbers, traceability, RoHS/REACH)
      are manual add-ons that prolong quoting and introduce mistakes.
    - >-
      ERP/CPQ modules are generic; they don’t interpret prints/specs, propose
      laminate stackups, or compute routing automatically.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ ingestion: parse emails, PDFs, DXF/DWG/STEP; detect materials,
      tolerances, finishes, UL/ASTM/NEMA callouts.
    - >-
      Laminate stackup recommender: map specs to NEMA grades and supplier
      equivalents; suggest alternates with compliance notes.
    - >-
      Costing engine: material yield optimization (panel selection, nesting,
      scrap), press cycle/cure, machining ops (saw/CNC/waterjet), secondary
      finishes, packaging, freight class.
    - >-
      Lead-time estimator: capacity-aware (press slots, cure windows, machining
      calendars), raw stock availability, supplier lead times; automatic
      expedite options.
    - >-
      Quote composer: multi-quantity price breaks, substitute options, T&Cs,
      validity windows; 1-click export to ERP/CPQ and branded PDF/Email.
    - >-
      Clarifying questions generator: flags spec conflicts, missing
      dimensions/tolerances, impossible callouts, and offers resolution
      templates.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: review/approve changes, editable BOM/routing; track
      revisions and approval trails.
    - >-
      Data and compliance: maintains UL file numbers, lot traceability fields,
      RoHS/REACH status in the quote; auto-attach CoC templates.
    - >-
      Integrations: inbox connectors (O365/Gmail), ERP/MES (Epicor, Infor,
      JobBOSS2/E2, DELMIAWorks, ProShop), CAD (SolidWorks, AutoCAD), cloud
      storage (SharePoint/Box/Drive).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quote laminated plastics 2–5x faster with +/-5–8% cost accuracy by Day 30.
    Our AI reads RFQs/drawings, proposes compliant laminate stackups and
    substitutes, optimizes cut plans, models press/machining time and lead
    times, then drafts quotes and clarifying questions—purpose-built for
    NEMA-grade laminated sheets and shapes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific data network effects and models: each deployment improves
    laminate stackup mapping, yield optimization, and time/cost estimates across
    NEMA grades and suppliers. Proprietary vision+text parsers for drawings and
    a laminate-aware nesting/press model create accuracy and speed competitors
    can’t match. Early ERP/distributor partnerships embed us in the quoting
    workflow and make switching costly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Estimators and sales engineers at laminated plastics plate, sheet
    (non‑packaging), and shape manufacturers who need to turn RFQs into
    accurate, profitable quotes fast.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive in mixed formats with incomplete specs, custom layups,
    and tight deadlines. Internal: teams feel rushed, error‑prone, and worried
    about margin leakage. Philosophical: quoting complex laminates should be
    precise and predictable, not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the laminated plastics quoting grind. Our AI copilot parses
    RFQs, drawings, and specs; maps requirements to NEMA grades (e.g.,
    G‑10/FR‑4, XX, CE, LE), UL 94, and ASTM D709; and encodes your materials,
    stackups, routings, and cost rules. Human‑in‑the‑loop review, change
    tracking, and integrations build trust.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload RFQs/drawings/specs; 2) Copilot proposes laminate
    stackups/materials, routings, yields, and flags gaps; 3) It estimates cost
    and lead time; 4) Drafts quote and clarifying questions; 5) You review,
    approve, and send. Agreement: start with a pilot; keep data under your
    control; role‑based access; ERP/PLM integration; full audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and run a live RFQ. Transitional: Start a short pilot on
    recent RFQs and get a laminated quoting checklist + sample quote pack.
  success: >-
    Faster quote turnaround, higher hit rates, protected margins, standardized
    stackups and pricing, less rework, quicker onboarding of new estimators, and
    buyers who trust your clear, complete quotes.
  failure: >-
    Without the copilot: missed deadlines, lost bids, inconsistent pricing,
    preventable errors, margin erosion, and dependency on scarce tribal
    knowledge.
