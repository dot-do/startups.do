leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Quote backlogs delay bids (1–5 days typical cycle), causing missed
      deadlines and lower win rates.
    - >-
      High variability and tribal knowledge in estimating weldments, thick-plate
      cutting, machining, and finishing leads to inconsistent pricing and margin
      leakage.
    - >-
      Manual parsing of RFQs (PDF drawings, 2D/3D CAD, specs) is
      error-prone—missed weld symbols, GD&T, materials, coatings, hardware.
    - >-
      Estimators spend 40–70% of time on low-value tasks: extracting BOMs,
      material takeoff, process routing, and cycle time lookups.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated cost models for multi-process builds
      (cut/bend/machine/weld/paint), resulting in rework when jobs hit the shop.
    - >-
      Difficult to align quotes with current steel prices, nesting yields,
      machine utilization, and shop-specific rates in real time.
    - >-
      ERP/PLM/CPQ/quoting tools are siloed; manual re-entry creates delays and
      errors.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks visibility into quote throughput, accuracy, and margin
      risk per RFQ.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered RFQ parsing for PDFs and CAD (2D/3D) to auto-extract BOM,
      material specs, weld symbols, GD&T, finishes, and tolerances.
    - >-
      Shop-calibrated process planning and cycle-time estimation across cutting,
      bending, machining, welding, heat treat, blasting/painting, assembly.
    - >-
      Automated material takeoff and nesting-aware utilization to reflect real
      yields and current steel prices.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing engine with margin controls, risk flags, and what-if
      scenarios.
    - >-
      One-click creation of ERP routing/quote records and bid packages; API
      connectors to CAD/PLM/ERP/CPQ.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workflow for high-risk items; confidence scoring
      and exception handling.
    - >-
      Quote analytics: throughput, accuracy vs realized cost, hit rate, and
      margin leakage insights.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Estimating managers and sales engineers at construction machinery OEMs and
    attachment makers (NAICS 333120) who must turn complex RFQs into accurate
    quotes—fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: A flood of RFQs with drawings/specs; manual parsing,
    spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge cause bottlenecks, errors, and slow
    response. - Internal: Teams work nights, fear missed details, and lack
    confidence in margins. - Philosophical: Great builders shouldn’t lose work
    or profit because quoting is manual. - Villain: Messy PDFs/prints and siloed
    know-how.
  guide: >-
    RFQ-to-Quote Autopilot understands the grind of quoting heavy equipment
    parts. Empathy: messy PDFs, ambiguous weld symbols, shifting specs.
    Authority: AI trained on weldments and machined parts; parses PDF/DWG/STEP;
    integrates with CAD/PLM and ERP/CPQ; secure and auditable. Proven to cut
    quote prep time 60–80% while tightening variance to actuals.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Pilot with 10–20 RFQs to validate outputs. 2) Configure
    material catalogs, process rates (cut, form, machine, weld, paint,
    assemble), overhead/margin rules, and approval thresholds. 3) Integrate with
    CAD/PLM and ERP/CPQ; enable human-in-the-loop review. 4) Scale from assisted
    to autopilot quoting with continuous learning. - Agreement: SOC 2/NDA, data
    residency options, transparent cost model, your team approves before send.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo using your RFQs or start a 14-day pilot. -
    Transitional: Download the RFQ-to-Quote playbook and run the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    - Same-day quotes at scale with predictable lead times. - +15–25% quoting
    throughput and higher win rate. - 2–5 margin points protected via
    standardized costing and live commodity feeds. - Institutionalized tribal
    knowledge; fewer RFIs and disputes. - Happier teams—engineers focus on
    design, not data entry.
  failure: >-
    - Missed bid windows and lost deals to faster competitors. - Margin erosion
    from underestimates and scope gaps. - Burned-out estimators and disappearing
    tribal knowledge. - Rework and customer churn from BOM/cycle-time errors.
