  problem:
    - >-
      Producers face volatile moisture at harvest; each point of moisture above
      base triggers drying fees and dockage (often $0.02–$0.06 per point per
      bushel) or grade loss, yet waiting for field dry-down increases shatter,
      lodging, and pre-harvest sprout risk.
    - >-
      Routing grain between on-farm bins/dryers versus elevators is decided ad
      hoc without quantifying fuel cost, dryer capacity, elevator fees, line
      time, or forecasted weather risk.
    - >-
      Limited daily capacity across combines, trucks, and dryers creates
      bottlenecks; misallocating equipment increases wait time and late-season
      field loss.
    - >-
      Elevator hours, lines, and fee schedules change frequently; farmers lack
      reliable, real-time data to plan loads and avoid queues.
    - >-
      Existing tools (spreadsheets, weather apps, generic farm management
      software) don’t optimize under constraints or simulate moisture, dockage,
      and loss trade-offs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Moisture and quality forecaster: Field-level dry-down models for sorghum,
      barley, oats, rye, etc., calibrated with historic combine moisture maps
      and station/canopy weather, projecting moisture, test weight, and sprout
      risk by day.
    - >-
      Cost and constraint optimizer: Mixed-integer optimizer balances drying
      fees, fuel, grade/dockage schedules, elevator hours/lines, combine
      throughput, truck availability, dryer throughput (bu/hr/point), and bin
      capacity to produce a daily harvest and routing plan.
    - >-
      Elevator intelligence: Aggregates live/near-real-time elevator hours, line
      estimates, moisture/grade discount schedules, and delivery policies;
      alerts when queues or fees change.
    - >-
      On-farm dryer model: Estimates energy cost by moisture point removed by
      crop and dryer type (e.g., continuous flow vs. batch), accounting for
      ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Dispatch and visibility: Mobile app and radio-friendly summaries for
      crew—field order, truck destinations, expected cycle time, and contingency
      plans as weather or queues shift.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: What-if simulations (e.g., storm in 48 hours, propane
      price spike, extra truck hired) with clear $/acre impact.
    - >-
      Integrations: Ingests equipment telematics, yield/moisture maps, and work
      orders from John Deere Operations Center, Case IH AFS, Climate/FieldView,
      Trimble; weather from NOAA/ECMWF; optional moisture probe/handheld inputs.
    - >-
      Post-season analytics: Quantifies realized savings vs. baseline; guides
      hybrid/variety and storage investments for next season.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that schedules harvest order and routes loads to elevator vs. on-farm
    bins to minimize total cost (drying + dockage + field loss + wait time)
    under real equipment, storage, and weather constraints—saving $4–$12 per
    acre and finishing harvest 2–4 days earlier on average for mid-to-large
    operations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    First-party, real-time elevator fee/line dataset plus calibrated dry-down
    and field-loss models for non-corn grains, combined with a harvest-specific
    optimizer and tight OEM/elevator integrations—creating switching costs and
    network effects as more elevators and farms participate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Grain growers and harvest managers who want to harvest in the optimal order
    and route loads to bins or elevators to protect margin and grain quality.
  problem: >-
    - External: Moisture swings, storm windows, elevator wait times, and limited
    dryer/bin capacity make harvest sequencing risky.

    - Internal: Constant second-guessing, late-night re-planning, and
    uncertainty about where to send the next load.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to burn profit on drying and dockage
    because timing decisions rely on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the harvest squeeze. Our team blends agronomy, logistics, and
    AI to schedule field order and bin vs. elevator routing under real weather
    and capacity constraints. The system is transparent—showing assumptions,
    costs, and what-if scenarios you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import fields/acres, crops/hybrids, moisture data, dryer/bin
    capacity, elevator hours/prices, fleet limits; enable local forecast.

    2) Review: Get a daily ranked harvest order and routing plan with expected
    drying, dockage, and loss costs.

    3) Execute: Follow clear cut/haul targets; receive alerts as queues,
    weather, or moisture change.

    4) Improve: Start with a pilot block; roll out farm-wide in days with
    ongoing adjustments.
  callToAction: |-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo to build your harvest plan.
    Transitional: Run a free pre‑harvest scenario and download a sample plan.
  success: >-
    Lower drying and dockage costs, fewer wet loads, minimized field loss,
    smoother dryer/elevator utilization, shorter queues, higher net per acre,
    and a calmer, data-backed harvest.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you risk paying for unnecessary drying, surprise dockage,
    weather-related field loss, jammed dryers and trucks, missed elevator
    windows, and a reactive, stressful harvest.
