leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers lose high‑intent digital shoppers when finance steps are slow,
      require SSN, or trigger hard pulls early in the journey.
    - >-
      Sales teams spend 20–40 minutes per deal re‑keying buyer data into
      multiple lender portals (RouteOne, Dealertrack, single‑lender sites),
      leading to data errors and lower submission throughput.
    - >-
      Inconsistent payment estimates cause customer friction and desking
      re‑works; taxes/fees/add‑ons are often misapplied for powersports
      (accessories, freight, doc, setup).
    - >-
      Finance penetration is volatile (30–60% typical in powersports), with
      limited visibility into which lenders/tiers are most productive by unit
      type, price band, and geography.
    - >-
      Compliance risk (FCRA/GLBA/ECOA/TCPA/Reg B, adverse action, consent
      capture, data retention) is high and frequently under‑documented in small
      to midsize dealerships.
    - >-
      CRM/DMS fragmentation (DX1, Lightspeed, ARI, Dealer Spike, PSXDigital,
      etc.) causes lead leakage and poor follow‑up on finance‑ready buyers.
    - >-
      OEM & seasonal demand spikes overwhelm F&I capacity; dealers cannot staff
      flexibly for peak periods.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI concierge collects buyer info via SMS/web widget with explicit consent
      and performs soft‑pull pre‑qualification through approved provider (no
      hard inquiry).
    - >-
      Dynamic payment estimates by unit, ZIP, lender tier, term, taxes/fees,
      accessories, and protections; accuracy tuned using historical lender rate
      cards and approval outcomes.
    - >-
      One‑click mapping and submission of full credit app to
      RouteOne/Dealertrack and selected direct lender portals; auto‑populate
      from pre‑qual to reduce re‑keying.
    - >-
      Automated lender waterfall suggestions by unit type and credit tier;
      learns from dealer’s historical fund rates and callbacks.
    - >-
      Integrated consent capture, audit trails, and adverse‑action workflows;
      pre‑configured disclosures and retention schedules.
    - >-
      Dealer‑side dashboard with lead scoring, tasking, and CRM/DMS sync;
      buyer‑side chat/SMS to close gaps and schedule test rides.
    - >-
      Analytics on finance penetration, lender mix, approval SLAs, and estimated
      vs. funded payment accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase finance penetration 8–15% and cut time‑to‑approval by 20–30 minutes
    per deal with a compliant, no‑SSN, AI‑assisted pre‑qual and multi‑lender
    submission workflow purpose‑built for powersports.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    (unit‑specific programs, fees, and lender matrices), combined with

    approval and payment‑accuracy data improve lender routing and estimate
    precision beyond generic tools.
