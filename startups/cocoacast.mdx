  title: SKU-Level Demand Forecasting and Promo Uplift
  description: >-
    Forecast weekly demand per SKU/channel with promo/holiday effects to drive
    purchase and production plans.
  targetUsers:
    - Demand planners

    - Promo calendar and price changes
    - Stockouts and lead times
    - Holidays/weather by market
    - Retailer planograms if available
  steps:

  problem:
    - >-
      High weekly volatility at SKU x channel leads to 25–40% MAPE using
      spreadsheet- or ERP-native forecasting; promo-driven spikes (+50–300%) are
      poorly captured, causing simultaneous stockouts and overproduction.
    - >-
      Seasonality and holiday demand (Valentine’s +3–5x, Easter +2–4x, Halloween
      +4–6x, Christmas +2–3x) interact with weather and display/feature support,
      making weekly planning unreliable.
    - >-
      Shelf-life constraints (6–18 months) and melt risk create 1–3% write-offs
      and returns; slow-moving seasonal SKUs compound obsolescence risk.
    - >-
      Retailer OTIF penalties (1–3% of invoice) and lost end-cap opportunities
      due to under-forecasted promotions erode margins.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across ERP (SAP/Oracle/Microsoft), syndicated POS
      (IRI/Nielsen), retailer portals, and trade-promo calendars forces manual
      Excel reconciliation and delays decisions.
    - >-
      Capacity and changeover constraints (wrapping/molding lines, packaging)
      aren’t reflected in forecasts, leading to infeasible production plans and
      rush purchases of chocolate/packaging.
    - >-
      New SKU launches and pack-size changes cannibalize base SKUs, but
      uplift/cannibalization is rarely modeled at attribute level, degrading
      accuracy for 6–12 months post-launch.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data unification: Prebuilt connectors for SAP/Oracle/Microsoft ERPs,
      IRI/Nielsen/retailer POS, trade-promo calendars, pricing, display/feature
      flags, and weather; automated SKU-channel mapping and data QC.
    - >-
      Baseline + uplift modeling: Hierarchical time-series models with causal
      promo/price/holiday features; Bayesian priors and attribute transfer for
      new SKUs; cannibalization and halo modeling within brand/pack-size
      families.
    - >-
      Seasonality + holiday intelligence: Confectionery-specific holiday
      templates and temperature-sensitive demand features; automatic holiday
      shifting by retailer/channel.
    - >-
      Hierarchical reconciliation: SKU→brand→category and channel→retailer
      →region reconciliation (MinT/BU) with explainable drivers and bias
      controls.
    - >-
      Promo scenario planning: Simulate TPR/BOGO/display, timing, and depth;
      generate uplift forecasts, volume ladders, and predicted ROI with
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Supply-aware outputs: Recommended weekly purchase and production
      quantities with safety stock, shelf-life, MOQ, and line changeover
      constraints; export to MRP/IBP.
    - >-
      MLOps + governance: Weekly retrains, drift monitoring, backtesting,
      planner overrides with audit trails, and versioned forecast snapshots for
      S&OP.
    - >-
      Delivery: Cloud (SOC 2) or private VPC; API/EDI exports, embedded
      dashboards, and Excel plug-in for planners.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SKU- and channel-level weekly forecasts with promotion and holiday uplift
    that improve accuracy by 20–40%, cut stockouts by 20–30%, and reduce
    inventory 5–15% within 3–6 months—implemented in 4–8 weeks and integrated
    with your ERP and retailer data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Confectionery-specialized uplift and holiday models with temperature
    sensitivity, prebuilt retailer/promo connectors, and anonymized
    cross-customer priors enabling accurate forecasts in weeks—not quarters.
    Embedded shelf-life and changeover constraints translate forecasts into
    feasible production and purchase plans, driving faster ROI and planner
    trust.
