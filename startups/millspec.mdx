  problem:
    - >-
      Head millers rely on tacit knowledge to translate variable wheat
      attributes (moisture, protein, hardness, vitreousness, kernel size) into
      optimal roll gaps/differentials, feed rates, and sifter settings, leading
      to inconsistent product when staff changes or shifts vary.
    - >-
      Wheat variability between lots and blends causes frequent drift in
      ash/protein/granulation; mills over-tighten specs (e.g., target below ash
      limit) to avoid customer claims, sacrificing yield and throughput.
    - >-
      Reactive adjustments after lab/NIR results cause rework, recirculation,
      and downtime; changeovers take too long to stabilize to spec.
    - >-
      Energy usage and wear (rolls, sifter cloth) increase when running
      suboptimal settings.
    - >-
      Limited instrumentation integration (NIR, particle size, power) and siloed
      data (LIMS, PLC/SCADA) hinder predictive optimization.
    - >-
      New millers need months/years to reach expert performance; knowledge
      capture and standardization across multi-site fleets is weak.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven recommender: Use historical runs and real-time sensor fusion
      to suggest optimal roll gaps/differentials, feed rates, tempering
      moisture/time, and sifter allocations for given wheat blends and product
      specs.
    - >-
      Digital twin and what-if optimizer: Simulate outcomes for new wheat
      lots/blends and target specs before running, with predicted KPI confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optionality: Start as decision support (operator-in-the-loop);
      mature to closed-loop setpoint control via PLC/SCADA under guardrails and
      safety interlocks.
    - >-
      Drift detection and adaptive control: Detect quality drift (e.g., ash
      trending high) and propose minimal-adjustment corrections with uncertainty
      bounds.
    - >-
      Knowledge capture: Build a site- and product-specific settings library
      with auto-versioning, traceability, and HACCP-ready audit trails.
    - >-
      Multi-site benchmarking: Compare lines/sites on key process capability
      indices (Cp/Cpk for ash/protein/granulation), share best recipes, and
      quantify savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit flour ash/protein/granulation targets first time, every time. MillSpec
    AI learns the mapping from wheat attributes and real-time signals to optimal
    mill settings—reducing rework, stabilizing quality, and lifting yield while
    codifying expert know-how across sites.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously expanding, anonymized cross-mill dataset plus a
    physics-informed learning approach yields faster, safer optimization than
    pure heuristics or generic APC. Co-development with OEMs and embedded head
    millers captures tacit know-how and standardizes best-practice settings
    across products and sites, creating high switching costs.

  character: >-
    Head millers, production managers, and QA leads who must hit
    ash/protein/granulation targets at throughput with minimal rework.
  problem: >-
    - External: Incoming wheat varies; roll gaps, differential speeds, and
    sifter settings interact in non-obvious ways.

    - Internal: Too much guesswork, late lab surprises, and reliance on tribal
    knowledge.

    - Philosophical: Hitting spec shouldn’t depend on who’s on shift or how
    today’s wheat behaves.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit spec while keeping lines moving. Our team
    blends milling-process expertise with applied ML, using your historical runs
    and lab data to learn your mill and recommend optimal roll gaps, speeds, and
    sifter allocations—backed by clear guardrails.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Consolidate wheat attributes, equipment settings, and lab results
    (no PLC overhaul).

    - Learn: Train and validate a mill-specific model on your history; simulate
    against targets.

    - Deploy: Live, shift-ready recommendations with confidence ranges and
    continuous learning.

    - Pilot: Start on one line with defined success metrics and a fast, low-risk
    rollout.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute discovery call to scope a 4‑week pilot; request a
    no-cost data readiness check and ROI estimate.
