  problem:
    - >-
      Gross margins are thin (typically 1.5–4.0%); static cost-plus rules and
      manual overrides leave 50–150 bps of margin on the table.
    - >-
      Price changes lag input cost volatility and vendor allowance changes by
      weeks, causing delayed pass-through and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Customer-tier and contract compliance is error-prone; price exceptions and
      retroactive bill-backs create audit risk and lost credibility.
    - >-
      Promotions and temporary price reductions are scheduled by habit rather
      than elasticity; trade funds are underutilized or misallocated, and promo
      ROI is opaque.
    - >-
      Sales teams lack rapid what-if tools; pricing cycles take days, and
      approvals bottleneck in email/Excel with little traceability.
    - >-
      Limited competitive and market signal usage (scanner data, commodity
      indices, local price checks), leading to over- or under-pricing by
      location and channel.
    - >-
      No controlled experimentation; difficult to measure causal impact of price
      or promo changes across SKUs and customer tiers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and normalization: automate pipelines from ERP, WMS,
      rebate/TPM, EDI 832/879/844, vendor deal sheets, and cost files; enrich
      with competitive price indices, commodity feeds, and seasonality signals.
    - >-
      Elasticity and cross-elasticity modeling at SKU x customer-tier x region;
      capture halo and cannibalization effects; estimate promo lift curves and
      pass-through dynamics for funded deals.
    - >-
      Constrained optimization engine: recommends list, net, and floor prices
      plus promo calendars subject to min-margin, contract clauses,
      customer-tier rules, MAP where applicable, and vendor funding caps.
    - >-
      Promo and trade-fund allocator: maximize GMROI within co-op and bill-back
      rules; propose timing, depth, and duration by category and customer tier.
    - >-
      What-if simulator and deal desk: sales can simulate quotes, stack
      allowances, and view predicted margin and volume impacts before approval;
      exception workflow with SLA and audit trail.
    - >-
      Experimentation framework: design A/B or geo tests across branches or
      customer cohorts; measure realized uplift and feed models; MAPE and bias
      monitoring.
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: full explainability, change logs, approval
      trails, SOX/SOC2-ready controls; automatic detection of contract
      violations and margin leakage.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors: push approved prices to ERP, publish EDI 879 price
      change advisories, sync with TPM/rebate tools; BI dashboards for KPIs and
      audit exports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase gross margin by 60–150 bps while protecting volume and staying 100%
    within contract and customer-tier guardrails; improve promo ROI by 15–30%
    and cut price cycle time from days to hours with auditable, explainable AI
    purpose-built for grocery wholesale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Wholesale-specific optimization that natively honors customer-tier rules,
    contract clauses, and trade-fund mechanics, delivered through certified
    ERP/EDI connectors and an explainable engine with audit-grade traceability.
    Anonymized cross-client benchmarks accelerate model accuracy and time to
    value, and the embedded experimentation framework quantifies impact credibly
    for finance and audit.

    - Who: General Line Grocery Merchant Wholesalers (pricing, category, and
    sales leaders)

    - Want: Confident, profitable customer-tier price lists and promo schedules
    that honor contracts and drive volume.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Margin erosion from volatile costs and manual, siloed pricing
    decisions.

    - External: Thousands of SKUs/tiers, vendor deals, deviated pricing, promo
    funds, and constant cost changes—plus contract floors/ceilings.

    - Internal: Teams feel blind and overworked; fear of over/underpricing and
    missing rebates.

    - Philosophical: Setting fair, profitable prices shouldn’t require guesswork
    or all-nighters.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand wholesale reality—thin margins, contract
    exceptions, vendor-funded promos, and sales pressure.

    - Authority: Wholesale-specific AI models, explainable recommendations,
    ERP/BI integrations, audit trails, and governance-ready workflows.
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Connect data and rules: ERP, contracts, costs, vendor funds, and benchmarks; define guardrails and KPIs.
      2) Simulate and recommend: Calibrate elasticity, forecast volume/margin, propose tier prices and promo calendars within constraints.
      3) Approve and deploy: Review exceptions, apply overrides, publish to ERP; monitor lift and auto-tune.
    - Agreement Plan: Respect all contracts and floors/ceilings;
    human-in-the-loop overrides; explainability; secure data handling and access
    controls; rollback and change logs.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a live demo with your data.

    - Transitional: Request a pricing audit and ROI model; download the
    Wholesale Pricing Playbook.
  success: >-
    - Profitable growth: higher pocket margin per case, smarter promo ROI,
    faster pass-through of cost changes, fewer disputes/overrides, confident
    sales conversations, and stronger retention/expansion.
  failure: >-
    - Without this: continued margin leakage, misaligned promos, compliance risk
    with contracts, lost share to sharper competitors, eroded vendor funds, and
    burned-out pricing teams.
