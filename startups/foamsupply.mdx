  problem:
    - >-
      Resin (EPS/XPS-grade PS) and pentane demand is volatile and SKU-mix
      driven; most plants plan with spreadsheets, leading to 8–20% forecast
      error at SKU-level and frequent stockouts or overstock.
    - >-
      Lead times and MOQs from multiple suppliers vary widely (2–10 weeks);
      without probabilistic planning, plants either carry excess safety stock
      (tying up working capital) or pay rush freight/premium spot prices.
    - >-
      Price volatility in styrene/benzene and pentane creates 1–5% purchase
      price variance; buyers lack tools to time buys or allocate volume to
      contracts vs spot with quantified risk.
    - >-
      Tank farm and silo constraints, hazmat storage limits, and recipe-level
      pentane/resin ratios are not modeled by generic MRP/ERP, causing
      infeasible POs and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Cross-functional data (production schedules, scrap, density, bead type,
      run rates) is siloed; planners spend 6–10 hours/week consolidating data
      rather than optimizing POs.
    - >-
      Existing tools don’t simulate supplier disruptions or weather/seasonality
      tied to construction cycles, leading to preventable line stoppages.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-level probabilistic demand forecasts for EPS/XPS resin and pentane
      using production schedules, recipes, density, scrap, seasonality, and
      external indicators (housing starts, weather).
    - >-
      Optimization engine that proposes multi-period POs meeting service-level
      targets while respecting MOQs, lead-time distributions, tank/silo
      capacity, supplier mix, and regulatory constraints.
    - >-
      Price-risk module that blends contracts vs spot, evaluates timing windows,
      and recommends allocation to minimize expected cost within risk tolerance.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: demand surges, supplier delay, recipe changes,
      maintenance downtime, or new SKU launches.
    - >-
      Auto-generated, ERP-ready PO recommendations with approvals workflow and
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Dashboards: forecast accuracy, inventory coverage by SKU, stockout risk
      heatmap, expected savings, and purchase price variance vs index.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI for EPS/XPS that forecasts resin and pentane by SKU and
    generates compliant, cost-optimal POs under real-world constraints (lead
    time, MOQ, tank/silo capacity, hazmat rules, price risk)—reducing stockouts,
    working capital, and purchase price variance in 4–8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned optimization engine that jointly models SKU-level foam
    recipes, pentane/resin co-consumption, tank/silo and hazmat constraints, and
    price-risk—plus prebuilt integrations and benchmark datasets from
    pilots—delivering measurable savings in weeks rather than generic tools’
    months-long customizations.
