  problem:
    - >-
      Escalating process complexity at advanced nodes (N5→N2, advanced 3D
      NAND/DRAM, advanced packaging) drives exponential growth in recipe knobs
      and interactions; manual DOE cannot efficiently explore 10–50 variable
      spaces with tight cross-tool constraints.
    - >-
      DOE cycles are slow and costly: 2–6 weeks per iteration; 20–200 wafers
      consumed per DOE; >$250k per major DOE cycle across wafers, tool time, and
      metrology; delays stall time-to-yield and revenue ramps.
    - >-
      Inline metrology and FDC/APC data are siloed across MES, SPC tools (e.g.,
      JMP, Cornerstone), and OEM controllers, making it hard to combine prior
      DOEs with current line signals for informed next experiments.
    - >-
      Engineers lack quantitative guidance on multi-objective trade-offs
      (CD/overlay/thickness uniformity/line-edge roughness/sheet-R), leading to
      suboptimal choices and over-conservative process windows.
    - >-
      Current tools don’t fully account for measurement uncertainty, tool drift,
      wafer-to-wafer and lot-to-lot variance, or hard safety constraints
      (contamination, chamber lifetime, spec limits), increasing risk of scrap
      or excursions.
    - >-
      Knowledge is trapped in tribal know-how; turnover and contractor churn
      cause re-learning costs and repeat DOEs.
    - >-
      Vendor qualification, data security, and on-prem requirements slow
      adoption of generic cloud AI; fabs require air-gapped or VPC deployments
      with full audit trails and change control.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate and harmonize historical DOE, recipe, and inline metrology data
      via connectors to MES, APC/FDC, SPC tools, and OEM logs; auto-curate
      features (knobs, context, tool state, wafer history).
    - >-
      Build multi-fidelity, multi-objective surrogate models (e.g., Gaussian
      Process, Bayesian Neural Net) that capture uncertainty, tool/lot
      variability, and known physics priors; incorporate guardrails for
      spec/safety constraints.
    - >-
      Recommend next-best experiments under budget, schedule, and risk
      constraints: minimal wafer count to hit targets; propose factor levels and
      lot assignments; simulate expected improvement and risk of excursion.
    - >-
      Run shadow-mode validation against historical data and small-sample
      confirmation lots; provide Shapley-style factor importance and sensitivity
      to improve engineer trust.
    - >-
      Integrate with APC/run-to-run controllers for optional closed-loop
      micro-DOEs and rapid learning; writebacks include recipe IDs, parameter
      sets, and lot routing tags with full audit trails.
    - >-
      Continuously update models after each run; maintain experiment ledger,
      versioned models, and approvals to meet change-control and compliance
      needs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut DOE cycles and time-to-yield by 25–50% with constraint-aware,
    multi-objective Bayesian optimization that proposes the next-best
    experiments using your past DOEs and inline metrology—securely deployed
    on-prem or VPC and integrated with MES/APC/SPC for auditable,
    engineer-trustable decisions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Constraint- and uncertainty-aware DOE engine with cross-tool priors
    validated with OEM demo labs; deep integrations to MES/APC/SPC and SEMI
    standards; deployable on air-gapped on-prem appliances with full
    audit/change control—lowering qualification friction and enabling rapid,
    trustworthy adoption that generic AI tools cannot match.

  character: >-
    Process and applications engineers at semiconductor equipment manufacturers
    (NAICS 333242) who must quickly tune recipes and prove tool capability
    against CD, overlay, and thickness uniformity targets.
  problem: >-
    High‑dimensional recipes and interacting parameters make DOEs slow,
    expensive, and data‑siloed. Teams burn wafers and tool hours on
    trial‑and‑error, risking missed customer demos and unclear root causes.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to deliver robust process windows without wasting
    cycles. Our AI analyzes past DOEs and inline metrology to propose next‑best
    experiments that converge faster, with transparent sensitivity insights and
    guardbands.
  plan: >-
    3-step plan: 1) Connect historical DOEs and metrology (secure import or
    API). 2) We model sensitivities, interactions, and constraints to set a
    baseline and targets. 3) Receive ranked next‑best experiments; run, feed
    back results, and iterate until targets and robustness are achieved. Start
    with a low‑risk pilot on one tool/chamber with clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute pilot scoping. Or request a demo using anonymized
    historical data.
  success: >-
    Fewer runs to hit CD/overlay/uniformity specs, faster process windows, and
    freed tool capacity. Teams capture tacit know‑how, accelerate customer
    demos, and win more evaluations with confidence in recipe robustness.
  failure: >-
    Without this, DOEs stay slow and costly, schedules slip, wafers and tool
    hours are wasted, and competitors who learn faster set the benchmark.
