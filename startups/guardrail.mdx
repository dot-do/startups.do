leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Investment Policy Statements (IPS) and client-specific mandates live as
      unstructured PDFs/Word docs, making ongoing enforcement manual,
      error-prone, and slow.
    - >-
      Compliance teams rely on spreadsheets and spot checks to verify
      constraints (e.g., asset allocation bands, prohibited securities, ESG
      exclusions, concentration limits), creating audit risk and hidden
      breaches.
    - >-
      Existing compliance tools are either embedded in OMS/PMS and costly to
      customize, or lack NLP to translate bespoke IPS text into executable rules
      quickly.
    - >-
      Breaches are detected late (days/weeks), incident handling is
      inconsistent, and evidence for exams is scattered across email and
      SharePoint.
    - >-
      Policy changes take weeks to operationalize across multiple systems and
      custodians, causing operational drag and reputational/regulatory risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload IPS/mandate documents (PDF/Word) or fetch from DMS; LLM-based
      parser extracts constraints, definitions, thresholds, and exceptions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review turns extracted clauses into standardized rule
      templates; rules compile to a policy engine with full traceability back to
      source text.
    - >-
      Connect to portfolio/transaction data via APIs (PMS/OMS/custodians/data
      warehouses).
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring: post-trade checks run intraday/daily; optional
      pre-trade API for check-before-execution and allocation validation.
    - >-
      Breach triage and case management: explainable alert, evidence pack,
      root-cause analysis, workflow, and remediation logging.
    - >-
      Scenario testing and what-if: simulate proposed trades/policy changes;
      regression test across historical holdings.
    - >-
      Audit-grade reporting: immutable logs, policy versions, approvals, and
      exam-ready reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any IPS or mandate into auditable, system-enforced rules in hours, not
    months. Guardrail Monitor parses IPS text, compiles it into
    machine-checkable constraints, continuously monitors portfolios across
    custodians/OMS/PMS, and provides real-time breach detection, explainable
    alerts, and exam-ready evidence—without ripping and replacing existing
    systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary IPS-to-rule dataset with human-verified mappings and
    clause templates, coupled with prebuilt integrations across major
    PMS/OMS/custodians and an explainable policy engine that traces every alert
    to IPS source text. This combination shortens onboarding to days, drives
    accuracy benchmarks competitors struggle to match, and creates data network
    effects across diverse mandate types.
