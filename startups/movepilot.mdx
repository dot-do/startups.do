  problem:
    - >-
      Slow speed-to-lead: Movers often take 15–60 minutes to respond to web
      forms and marketplace inquiries; leads decay by ~10x after 5 minutes.
    - >-
      Missed calls/after-hours leakage: 30–45% of inbound calls occur after
      hours or during peak season; voicemail callbacks convert poorly.
    - >-
      Inconsistent qualification: Agents collect incomplete details (inventory,
      access constraints, dates, serviceability), leading to inaccurate
      estimates and no-shows.
    - >-
      High inside sales cost: $4–$8 per call handled and $25–$50 per booked
      survey when using human-only teams or BPOs.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: Phones, SMS, webchat, CRM, and calendars aren’t
      synchronized, causing double-booking, manual entry, and lost leads.
    - >-
      Poor attribution: Lead source and campaign data are not tied to booked
      surveys, obscuring ROI and optimization.
    - >-
      Seasonality and staffing: Summer spikes overwhelm teams; winter
      underutilizes staff; hiring/training cycles are costly and slow.
    - >-
      Multilingual gaps: Missed opportunities in Spanish and other languages;
      translation quality impacts trust.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: TCPA/SMS opt-in, call recording notices, and data
      handling inconsistencies create legal exposure.
    - >-
      Limited calendar utilization: Estimator schedules have gaps due to
      friction in booking and reminder failures.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI answers phone, SMS, webchat, and marketplace messages in under 3
      seconds with mover-specific scripts.
    - >-

      types, stairs/elevator, parking/access, inventory/bulky items, special
      handling, and serviceability checks.
