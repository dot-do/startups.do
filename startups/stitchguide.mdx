  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers are overwhelmed by thousands of patterns, kits, fabrics, and
      notions; discovery is time-consuming and intimidating for beginners.
    - >-
      Independent retailers are short-staffed during peak hours and after-hours;
      expert guidance isn’t consistently available online or in-store.
    - >-
      Ecommerce search is SKU-centric, not project-centric; it can’t translate a
      shopper’s goal (e.g., “I want a lap quilt for a baby shower”) into a
      complete cart with yardage and notions.
    - >-
      Upsells (thread, batting, interfacing, needles, rotary blades) are missed
      or inconsistent; store AOV underperforms.
    - >-
      Class registration funnels are disconnected from product discovery; shops
      lose cross-sell opportunities (pattern + class + kit).
    - >-
      Shops struggle to keep pattern, fabric, and class metadata organized
      (yardage, skill level, techniques) and aligned with live inventory.
    - >-
      Cart abandonment is high; shops lack automated follow-up tailored to the
      specific project.
    - >-
      Staff spend time answering repetitive questions (yardage math, fabric
      matching, what tools do I need?) instead of higher-value sales.
    - >-
      Retail tech stack is fragmented (POS, ecommerce, class scheduling); custom
      integration is costly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational assistant on web, mobile, and in-store kiosks that
      understands project goals and recommends patterns/kits, matching fabrics,
      and required notions.
    - >-
      Real-time inventory-aware recommendations with yardage calculation and
      fabric substitution logic; one-click cart creation in the retailer’s
      ecommerce/POS.
    - >-
      Automated, context-aware upsells (thread color, needle size, batting,
      interfacing, rulers) and cross-sells (classes, machine service plans).
    - >-
      Project “recipes” knowledge graph: skill level, techniques, yardage,
      fabric types, class alignment; continuously improved via retailer feedback
      and sales data.
    - >-
      Follow-up sequences for abandoned assisted carts via email/SMS with
      tailored reminders and alternatives when items go out of stock.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard measuring assisted conversions, AOV uplift, attach
      rates, and class registrations; experiment framework for continuous
      optimization.
    - >-
      Turnkey integrations with Shopify, Rain POS, Lightspeed, Square,
      WooCommerce; class scheduling integration (Shopify apps, Calendly-style,
      Eventbrite).
    - >-
      Deployment options: web widget, QR codes on shelf talkers, tablet kiosk,
      SMS opt-in, and printed receipt links for post-visit assistance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Project-first AI sales associate that turns a shopper’s intent into a
    complete, in-stock cart (pattern/kit + fabrics + notions + class), raising
    conversion and AOV while reducing staff workload.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A project-to-cart knowledge graph and yardage engine fine-tuned for
    sewing/quilting/needlework, integrated with niche retail POS/ecommerce
    systems (e.g., Rain POS) and enriched by distributor-sourced metadata.
    Continuous improvement from aggregated, privacy-preserving conversion data
    and retailer feedback creates a flywheel competitors lack.
