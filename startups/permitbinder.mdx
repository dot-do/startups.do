  problem:
    - >-
      Permits are lengthy (100–600 pages), inconsistent across states, and
      written in legal/technical language; converting them into actionable
      obligations and calendars typically takes 60–200 engineering hours per
      permit.
    - >-
      Compliance calendars live in spreadsheets/SharePoint with no traceability
      to permit citations; turnover and version control cause task drift and
      missed obligations.
    - >-
      Evidence (logs, photos, CEMS reports, DMRs, calibration certificates) is
      scattered across systems and emails, making audits and Title V
      certifications labor-intensive and error-prone.
    - >-
      Permit changes (renewals, modifications, consent orders) are frequent;
      updating calendars and training staff typically lags by 30–90 days,
      creating exposure to NOVs and penalties.
    - >-
      Preparing semiannual/annual Title V certifications and deviation reports
      consumes 80–200 hours per cycle per facility.
    - >-
      Existing EHS platforms require heavy configuration; consultants are
      accurate but slow/expensive and outputs are static documents.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted parsing of Title V/NSR/air/water/solid waste permits
      (PDF/Word/scans) into structured obligations with citations, conditions,
      limits, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
    - >-
      Auto-calendar builder that converts obligations into tasks with
      frequencies, triggers, responsible roles, due dates, and escalation rules;
      integrates with Outlook/Google/Teams/Slack.
    - >-
      Evidence binder templates per obligation (checklists, forms, photo
      uploads, instrument IDs, calibration records) with chain-of-custody and
      retention policies mapped to permit/recordkeeping periods.
    - >-
      Change detection and redlining for permit revisions; one-click
      calendar/evidence updates with impact analysis and training notes.
    - >-
      Deviations and CAPA workflow: flag missed tasks/limits, root cause,
      corrective actions, and management review; generates deviation logs.
    - >-
      Report generators for Title V semiannual/annual certifications, deviation
      summaries, NSPS/NESHAP and MACT-specific reports, stormwater MSGP annual
      reports, and NPDES DMR attachments.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA by environmental SMEs for high-confidence extraction
      and state-specific nuances; optional managed service to maintain calendars
      and evidence.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with common EHS/EMS and CMMS (e.g., Cority, Sphera,
      Enablon, Intelex, Mapistry), CEMS/stack test vendors, LIMS, and document
      repositories (SharePoint, Box).
    - >-
      Validation dashboards: obligation coverage, extraction confidence, overdue
      tasks, evidence completeness, and audit readiness score.
    - >-
      Mobile-friendly forms for operators to capture field evidence, meter
      readings, photos, and signatures offline.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any air/water/solid waste permit into a living, audit-ready compliance
    system in days: structured obligations mapped to a calendar with automated
    reminders and prebuilt evidence templates—traceable to permit citations and
    continuously updated on permit change.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, labeled corpus of state-specific permit conditions
    and a domain ontology that maps directly to calendar tasks and evidence
    templates—continuously improved via SME QA and customer feedback—plus permit
    change detection/redlining workflows tuned to agency formats, creating
    defensible traceability and rapid updates competitors struggle to match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    EHS and Operations leaders in All Other Petroleum and Coal Products
    Manufacturing (NAICS 324199) who want every permit condition turned into
    clear tasks, a live compliance calendar, and an audit-ready evidence binder.
  problem: >-
    External: Title V, NSR, air, water, and solid/hazardous waste permits are
    dense, fragmented, and frequently updated; deadlines and reporting duties
    are buried across documents and spreadsheets.

    Internal: You’re tired of chasing dates and documents and worried a missed
    condition will become an NOV, audit finding, or downtime.

    Philosophical: Compliance should be predictable and provable—not a scavenger
    hunt.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know how hard it is to translate permit language into daily
    actions and defend them under audit.

    Authority: Our domain-trained AI parses permit conditions into structured
    requirements mapped to citations and assets, then turns them into scheduled
    tasks with reminders and evidence templates.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload permits and related docs (Title V, NSR, NPDES/stormwater,
    wastewater, RCRA/solid waste, SPCC, SOPs).

    2) We extract and normalize conditions, assign owners/frequencies, and
    auto-build the compliance calendar with alerts.

    3) Deploy evidence capture templates and an exportable Evidence Binder;
    track status, changes, and proof.

    Agreement: You review/approve requirements before they go live; full
    traceability from condition → task → evidence.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo with your permits or start a pilot for one
    facility.

    Transitional: Get a free permit parsing snapshot and sample compliance
    calendar/binder.
  success: >-
    One source of truth for requirements, dates, owners, and proof; on-time
    tasks and confident reporting; faster audits with an organized, exportable
    Evidence Binder; reduced NOV risk and fewer surprises; more time for
    improvement.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines and findings leading to penalties; scramble during
    inspections; costly rework and overtime; damaged credibility and operational
    disruption.
