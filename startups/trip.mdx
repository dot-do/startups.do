  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers struggle to choose compliant luggage for specific airlines and
      trip types, leading to decision paralysis, store associate dependency, and
      returns when items do not meet size-weight rules.
    - >-
      Retailers lack a scalable way to map complex airline baggage rules to
      product specs and live inventory, losing upsell opportunities for
      accessories and bundles.
    - >-
      Ecommerce product discovery is generic; site search and filters do not
      capture trip context, causing low conversion, low attachment rate, and
      high cart abandonment.
    - >-
      Associates spend significant time answering repetitive compliance and
      packing questions, reducing floor productivity and increasing labor costs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent or outdated baggage policies online lead to customer
      complaints, returns, and brand trust erosion.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational assistant embedded on web, mobile, and in-store devices
