    notifications and status updates.
  targetUsers:
    - Customer operations
    - Comms/PR
    - NOC
  triggers:
    - Anomaly in telemetry
    - Spike in trouble calls
    - BGP/optical link down
  inputs:
    - Telemetry/SLAs
    - CRM subscriber lists by location/node
    - GIS shape files
    - Status page templates
  steps:
    - Detect/validate outage and impacted footprint
    - Estimate affected customers and services
    - Draft segmented comms (SMS/email/IVR/web)
    - Schedule/send after approval
    - Update status page and incident timeline
  tools:
    - Prometheus/Grafana
    - Esri/ArcGIS

    - Statuspage/API
    - Salesforce/HubSpot
  outputs:
    - Impact assessment

  pricingModel:
    - Retainer + per-incident
    - Optional per-message passthrough

  risks:
    - Over/under-notifying customers
    - Compliance with opt-out/CTIA
    - Inaccurate impact estimation
  dependencies:
    - Access to telemetry and CRM
    - Messaging provider accounts
    - Comms templates and approval workflow
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual outage-to-customer communication. Typical
      time-to-first-customer-notification (TTFN) is 45–90 minutes after NOC
      detection, causing customer frustration and social media backlash.
    - >-
      Inbound call spikes overwhelm care centers during outages (often 10–20x
      baseline). Without targeted notifications, 0.5–1.5% of affected customers
      call; at $5–$8 per call, costs escalate quickly.
    - >-
      Lack of accurate impact mapping. Existing NMS alarms don’t translate to a
      clear list of impacted accounts or geographies; carriers default to
      blanket messaging or silence.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools and regulatory risk. Disparate systems for SMS, email,
      IVR, app push, and web banners; manual templates slow approvals and risk
      TCPA/CAN-SPAM/10DLC non-compliance.
    - >-
      Over- or under-notification. Poor targeting drives opt-outs and trust
      erosion; under-communication drives churn and escalations to regulators.
    - >-
      No closed-loop learning. Most carriers can’t quantify call deflection,
      churn delta, or NPS impact from outage communications.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ingestion of network telemetry (SNMP/streaming telemetry,
      syslog), alarms, OTDR fiber events, BGP/route changes, perf metrics;
      correlation with topology/GIS, service inventory, and CRM.
    - >-
      ML-based anomaly detection and causal graph to declare incidents and
      estimate affected accounts, devices, and geo-polygons; confidence scoring
      and deduping.
    - >-
      Automated drafting of status updates (severity-specific, legally
      pre-approved), with auto-translate and tone-by-segment; approvals workflow
      when needed.
    - >-
      Multi-channel orchestration (SMS, email, voice/IVR, mobile push, in-portal
      banners, status page) with throttling, quiet hours, VIP/SLA handling, and
      opt-in/opt-out management.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning using ticket data, call center metadata, engagement
      metrics, and customer feedback to calibrate thresholds and templates over
      time.
    - >-
      Compliance engine for TCPA/CAN-SPAM/CASL, 10DLC brand/campaign
      registration, message rate limiting, and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect outages faster, quantify exactly who is impacted, and automatically
    inform the right customers on the right channels—cutting MTTR and inbound
    calls while improving trust. Typical targets: TTFN <5 minutes, 30–50% call
    deflection, 10–20 bps churn reduction in affected cohorts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-carrier, closed-loop dataset connecting network telemetry to
    customer impact and communication outcomes, enabling superior detection and
    targeting that is difficult to replicate in-house; deep prebuilt
    integrations across OSS/BSS and CPaaS with compliant workflows and
    established deliverability reputation (10DLC/email) that accelerate
    time-to-value and improve reach rates.

    Network operations and customer care leaders at wired telecommunications
    carriers who need to spot customer-impacting outages early and keep the
    right customers informed on the right channels.
  problem: >-
    External: Outages are detected late and communications are slow, generic, or
    sent to the wrong segments across SMS, email, IVR, app, and status pages.

    Internal: NOC teams are overwhelmed by alarms and manual updates; leaders
    fear customer backlash and SLA penalties.

    Philosophical: Customers deserve timely, transparent, and targeted updates
    when service is disrupted.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect uptime, SLAs, and brand trust. Our
    team combines telco operations expertise with production-grade AI,
    delivering proven detection models, channel orchestration, and clear
    auditability.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect data sources (network telemetry, OSS/BSS, ticketing)

    2) Calibrate detection and impact models

    3) Configure segments, templates, and channels

    4) Launch with guardrails and review workflows

    5) Monitor outcomes and continuously optimize

    Agreement plan: secure-by-design, privacy-compliant, opt-out management,
    role-based controls, and full audit logs.
