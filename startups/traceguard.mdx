  risks:
    - Gerber dialect inconsistencies causing false flags
    - Incomplete/incorrect fab rules lead to over/under-reporting
    - IP sensitivity of design data
  dependencies:
    - Accurate capability/rule deck
    - Layer mapping conventions
    - Secure file transfer/storage
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual pre-CAM DFM reviews at bare PCB fabs are slow (20–60 minutes per
      job), inconsistent across engineers, and delay RFQ-to-quote turnaround by
      24–48 hours.
    - >-
      Design data arrives in mixed formats (Gerber/ODB++/IPC-2581) with missing
      or ambiguous information, leading to repeated customer back-and-forth and
      engineering change orders (ECOs).
    - >-
      Existing rule-based DFM tools are either designer-focused (not
      fab-specific) or require heavy setup; they rarely propose concrete,
      fabrication-aligned fixes.
    - >-
      High-mix, low-volume fabs struggle to scale CAM throughput without adding
      headcount; labor shortages and tribal knowledge increase risk of DFM
      escapes and scrap.
    - >-
      Quoting teams need fast manufacturability risk scores to price accurately
      (NRE, lead time) but lack reliable automation integrated with fab-specific
      rules and capabilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated import and normalization of Gerber X2, ODB++, and IPC-2581 with
      project completeness checks (stackup, drill map, impedance notes, fab
      drawing).
    - >-
      Hybrid rules+ML engine that detects common and fab-specific DFM violations
      (e.g., annular ring, solder mask slivers, copper-to-edge, acid traps,
      plane voids, slot/drill conflicts) and assigns risk scores tied to the
      fab’s process limits.
    - >-
      Fix suggestions with parameterized actions (e.g., increase mask clearance
      by 3 mil on U3 pads; add teardrops on all BGA escapes below 5 mil drill;
      convert routed slots to plated slots with min web X) and optional
      auto-generated patch layers for CAM tools.
    - >-
      One-click DFM report for customers with annotated images, violation list,
      proposed fixes, and impact on cost/lead time; supports fab-branded PDFs
      and shareable links.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common CAM/quoting workflows (Frontline
      Genesis/InCAM Pro, UcamX, CAM350, internal quoting systems) to trigger
      checks at import and push back accepted patches.
    - >-
      Rule-deck management with versioning per line/capability (e.g., LDI vs.
      contact print, 2L vs. HDI), plus what-if simulation against capability
      changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven pre-CAM DFM that parses Gerber/ODB++/IPC-2581, flags
    manufacturability risks with fab-specific rule decks, and generates fix
    suggestions and patch artifacts — cutting CAM touch time by 50–70% and
    shrinking RFQ-to-quote SLA to same day while reducing DFM escapes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound data advantage from multi-fab, multi-process labeled outcomes plus
    closed-loop learning on accepted fixes; fix-suggestion engine that outputs
    CAM-ready patch layers; deep workflow integrations and compliance options
    (on-prem/ITAR) that are costly for incumbents to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: NAICS 334412 Bare Printed Circuit Board manufacturers (North
      America first), mid-size and large high-mix fabs with 5–50 CAM/quote
      engineers.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    PCB fabricators (NAICS 334412)—CAM leads, process engineers, and quoting
    teams who must accept customer PCB data quickly without sacrificing yield or
    on-time delivery.
  problem: >-
    External: Inbound Gerber/ODB++/IPC-2581 often violates shop rules, creating
    CAM backlogs, email ping-pong, rework, and delays. Internal: Teams fear
    missing DFM risks during manual checks and losing margin on fast-turn jobs.
    Philosophical: Clean data should build right the first time—DFM shouldn’t be
    a bottleneck.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the pressure of same-day turns, thin margins, and
    inconsistent customer datasets. Authority: Built with veteran PCB
    manufacturing engineers; supports Gerber/ODB++/IPC-2581; rule libraries
    aligned to IPC-6012 and your fab’s capabilities; integrates via API and
    exports CAM-ready annotations.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload or API-push design data. 2) Select or import your fab
    rule profile (or auto-detect). 3) Receive a ranked DFM risk report with
    pinpointed issues and rule-aligned fix suggestions; export notes to CAM or
    customer. Agreement: Data stays in your tenant or on-prem; no changes to
    golden data without approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot or request a demo. Transitional: Download a sample DFM
    report or run a sandbox on example boards.
  success: >-
    Shorter quote-to-CAM cycles, first-pass acceptances, fewer CAM tickets,
    predictable lead times, higher yield, and more won rush orders—engineers
    focus on value-add, not triage.
  failure: >-
    Without it: hidden DFM defects, late-stage surprises, scrap/rework, margin
    erosion, missed ship dates, CAM burnout, and lost customers.
