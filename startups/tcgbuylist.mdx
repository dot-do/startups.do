leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual pricing for singles/sealed is time-consuming (10–30 staff
      hours/week/store) and error-prone, leading to stale prices and lost
      margin.
    - >-
      Rapid market movements (reprints, bannings, metagame shifts, influencer
      hype) cause price volatility that most stores can’t track in real time
      across thousands of SKUs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent margins across channels (in-store, Shopify, TCGplayer,
      CardMarket, eBay, Whatnot) create leakage and customer confusion.
    - >-
      Buying inventory via buylist without budget control or real-time market
      anchoring leads to overpaying, poor turns, and cashflow crunches.
    - >-
      Catalog/condition variance (set, edition, foil, language, grading) and
      duplicated SKUs cause mispricing and operational friction.
    - >-
      Current tools are fragmented (POS, marketplace, price data, inventory)
      with no closed-loop automation tied to sell-through and desired margins.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing engine that updates sell and buylist prices every 5–15
      minutes based on market indices, competitor snapshots, store sell-through,
      and stock levels.
    - >-
      Configurable margin strategy by brand/set/condition/channel with
      floors/ceilings and exception rules to protect profitability.
    - >-
      Buylist budget automation: allocate daily/weekly budgets; auto-adjust buy
      prices based on remaining budget and desired stock depth.
    - >-
      Unified SKU mapping and condition rules across Scryfall/TCGplayer/MKM
      catalogs; per-store multipliers (foil, language, condition) to standardize
      pricing.
    - >-
      Real-time sync with POS (Shopify, Square, Lightspeed, BinderPOS,
      CrystalCommerce) and marketplaces (TCGplayer, CardMarket, eBay).
    - >-
      Outlier detection and approval workflow for high-value or volatile items;
      rollback and change logs for auditability.
    - >-
      Analytics: margin attribution, inventory turns, days-of-supply, buylist
      acceptance rate, price elasticity insights per set/card/condition.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on AI that sets and syncs in-store and online buy/sell prices for TCG
    singles and sealed—tuned to your margin goals, inventory targets, and
    budget, with guardrails to protect cashflow and brand.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, per-store learning from real sell-through and buylist outcomes
    (not just public price feeds), coupled with deep POS/marketplace
    integrations and SKU normalization. Over time, this creates a proprietary
    demand and elasticity dataset and rules tuning library that competitors
    without retailer telemetry cannot replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Local game stores (LGS) with 1–2 locations and a mix of singles and sealed
      products.
    - >-
      Multi-store hobby/game retail chains (3–20+ locations) needing centralized
      pricing governance with store-level autonomy.
    - >-
      Online-first TCG sellers operating on Shopify + marketplaces (TCGplayer,
      CardMarket, eBay).
    - >-
      Toy/hobby retailers expanding into TCG who lack pricing expertise but want
      automated, guardrailed entry.
    - >-
      High-volume marketplace power sellers needing fast repricing and buylist
      automation to maintain buy box share and margins.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to LGS via outreach and demos; focus on North America and
      UK/Ireland initially.
    - >-
      Partnership integrations and co-marketing with POS platforms (Shopify app,
      Square partner directory, Lightspeed, BinderPOS) and marketplaces
      (TCGplayer Pro, CardMarket).
    - >-
      Industry events: booths and talks at GAMA Expo, Gen Con Trade Day,
      Alliance/GTS/PhD retailer summits, PAX Unplugged, Astra Marketplace &
      Academy (toy).
    - >-
      Referral program: incentives for distributors’ account reps and existing
      retailers (revenue share or subscription credits).
    - >-
      Content marketing: pricing playbooks, ban-list reaction posts, set release
      margin guides, webinars with top store owners; active Discord/YouTube.

      operational time-savings.
