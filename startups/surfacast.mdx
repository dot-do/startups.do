  problem:
    - >-
      High-mix, small-batch surfactant manufacturing causes frequent changeovers
      and cleaning. Plants lose 10–25% of available reactor time to changeovers
      and 3–8% of batch mass to solvent flushes and off-spec rework.
    - >-
      Demand volatility and long-tail SKUs drive poor forecast accuracy (MAPE
      20–40% for tail SKUs), causing stockouts, expediting, and excess inventory
      (20–35 days over target).
    - >-
      Manual planning in spreadsheets and generic APS tools cannot manage
      reactor-tank-packaging constraints, raw material compatibility, or
      hazardous changeover matrices, leading to suboptimal campaigns and low
      plan adherence (<70%).
    - >-
      Cleaning and EHS constraints (CIP durations, solvent recovery limits, VOC
      and waste disposal fees) are not proactively optimized, inflating solvent
      usage by 10–30% and waste costs by 5–15% per year.
    - >-
      Raw material variability (lead times 2–12 weeks; price swings 10–25%)
      creates bullwhip effects without accurate SKU-level demand signals and
      consumption forecasts.
    - >-
      Weak S&OP to finite-scheduling handoff causes frequent re-plans (2–5 per
      week), missed service levels (OTIF <90%), and higher working capital.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified demand-plus-scheduling: Bayesian hierarchical forecasting tuned
      for B2B chemicals feeds a finite-capacity, constraint-based campaign
      scheduler that clusters runs by chemistry, viscosity, color, and
      compatibility to minimize changeovers and solvent flushes.
    - >-
      Surfactant-aware changeover optimization: Uses a domain changeover matrix
      (acid/base, feedstock family, color contamination risk, quaternization vs
      ethoxylation) and CIP solvent optimization to reduce cleaning time and
      waste while meeting quality and EHS constraints.
    - >-
      End-to-end constraints: Models reactors, storage tanks, heat/cool curves,
      transfer lines, packaging lines, QC release times, shelf life, raw
      material availability, and labor/shift calendars in one solver
      (MILP/CP-SAT hybrid).
    - >-
      Scenario planning and S&OP integration: Simulate demand shocks, raw
      material delays, and campaign length trade-offs; generate feasible plans
      for S&OP and produce finite schedules and production orders for MES/ERP.
    - >-
      Data integration accelerators: Prebuilt connectors for SAP (ECC/S4, IBP),
      MES/historians (e.g., OSI PI), LIMS, and WMS; API-first to push schedules
      back to ERP or APS.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Planners edit campaigns, lock runs, and set business
      rules; the optimizer respects overrides and updates KPIs in real time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A surfactant-specific AI platform that jointly forecasts SKU demand and
    builds solvent-conscious campaign schedules, reducing changeover hours by
    20–40%, solvent use by 15–30%, and improving forecast MAPE to under 15% for
    core SKUs—unlocking 2–5% effective capacity and payback in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A surfactant-specific changeover and CIP optimization library, pre-trained
    demand models for B2B chemical SKU patterns, and ready-made ERP/MES
    connectors enable faster time-to-value and measurable solvent and changeover
    reductions that generic APS or demand tools cannot match. Early proof points
    and benchmarks become proprietary references that raise switching costs.
