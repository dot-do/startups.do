  problem:
    - >-
      Leads go cold due to slow response: typical speed-to-lead is 1–12 hours
      (after-hours/weekends), while sub-5 minutes is needed to maximize
      conversion.
    - >-
      35–45% of leasing inquiries arrive after business hours; most go to
      voicemail or are answered by non-experts, reducing conversion quality.
    - >-
      Leasing staff spend 30–50% of their time answering repetitive FAQs
      (availability, pricing, pet policy, utilities) and triaging unqualified
      leads.
    - >-
      Inconsistent and non-compliant qualification scripts create Fair Housing
      risk and uneven prospect experiences.
    - >-
      Fragmented channels (listing sites, phone, webforms, email) cause
      duplicate leads, poor data hygiene, and missed follow-ups.
    - >-
      Scheduling friction and lack of reminders lead to 20–40% tour no-show
      rates.
    - >-
      High staff turnover and seasonal spikes make consistent coverage and
      training costly and difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified AI intake across phone, SMS, email, webforms, and listing-site
      leads with sub-60s first response and human-like voice.
    - >-
      Property-level knowledge base (availability, rent, fees, screening
      criteria) powering fair-housing-safe Q&A and qualification.
    - >-
      Automated tour scheduling, confirmations, and reminders via SMS/email;
      rescheduling and waitlist management.
    - >-
      Lead deduplication, scoring, and syncing to PMS/CRM (AppFolio, Buildium,
      Yardi Breeze, Rent Manager, RealPage) with full transcripts and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      After-hours and overflow call handling with configurable escalation to
      humans for edge cases or emergency maintenance routing.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: capture rate, qualification rate, tour conversion,
      no-show reduction, response SLAs, and cost per qualified lead.
    - >-
      Bilingual support (e.g., English/Spanish) and recorded/transcribed
      interactions for training and compliance review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 omnichannel AI that responds in under 60 seconds, consistently
    qualifies to your criteria, and books tours directly into your
    calendar/PMS—cutting voicemail by 70–90%, boosting show-ready tours by
    15–30%, and reducing leasing labor hours by 30–40% while maintaining Fair
    Housing–safe interactions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    531311, deep PMS integrations out-of-the-box, and a growing proprietary

    first-call resolution, and measurable conversion lift versus generic bots or
    human-only answering services.
