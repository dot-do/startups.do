  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned equipment downtime (pumps, compressors, BOPs, subsea trees,
      topside rotating equipment) causes production losses of $0.5M–$5M/day
      offshore and $50k–$500k/day onshore, with limited early-warning
      capability.
    - >-
      Telemetry is fragmented across SCADA/PLC, historians (e.g., OSIsoft PI),
      OEM controllers, and CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo), preventing holistic health
      assessment and prescriptive maintenance.
    - >-
      Existing condition monitoring focuses on thresholds/vibration; it lacks
      asset-specific physics/failure-mode context, leading to high false alarms
      and poor trust.
    - >-
      Maintenance is time-based or reactive, causing over-maintenance (wasted
      spend, spare parts stock) and missed incipient failures.
    - >-
      Critical safety equipment (BOPs, subsea trees) require compliance and
      assurance; current monitoring is manual and periodic, not continuous and
      predictive.
    - >-
      OEMs lack fleet-wide operational visibility once equipment is deployed,
      limiting warranty management, design feedback, and service revenue
      opportunities.
    - >-
      Field environments (offshore, subsea, remote) have low bandwidth and
      cybersecurity constraints, blocking central analytics without edge
      capabilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data fabric: pre-built connectors for SCADA/PLC, OSIsoft PI/AVEVA,
      subsea control modules, OEM controllers, and CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo), with
      asset registry and metadata harmonization.
    - >-
      Physics-informed, asset-class models: libraries for ESPs, centrifugal
      pumps, reciprocating and centrifugal compressors, BOP components, subsea
      tree valves/actuators, and topside rotors—combining vibration, pressures,
      temperatures, currents, and control signals with failure modes (FMEA).
    - >-
      Predict & prescribe: Remaining Useful Life (RUL), anomaly detection, and
      recommended actions with cost/impact, labor hours, and spare
      parts—auto-created as CMMS work orders with risk-ranked prioritization.
    - >-
      Reliability optimization: schedule/route optimization across crews,
      criticality-based maintenance planning, and spare parts forecasting tied
      to predicted failures.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud architecture: on-rig/plant edge agents for preprocessing,
      compression, and local inferencing; secure sync to cloud for fleet
      learning and benchmarking.
    - >-
      Assurance & compliance: audit trails, model explainability, and evidence
      packs aligned to API/ISO/IEC standards and class society expectations
      (e.g., API 16A/16D/6A; IEC 62443; ISO 14224).
    - >-
      ROI cockpit: real-time avoided downtime, reduced maintenance cost, and
      emissions impact calculation; A/B tests comparing AI-driven vs.
      business-as-usual outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An oil & gas–specific AI CoPilot that predicts failures and prescribes
    maintenance for critical field equipment by fusing physics-informed models,
    fleet benchmarks, and maintenance history—delivering earlier, trusted alerts
    with quantified ROI and automated CMMS actions, even in low-bandwidth,
    high-compliance environments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Asset-class specialization with physics-informed models mapped to FMEAs,
    combined with OEM partnerships and assured (DNV/ABS-reviewed)
    methodologies—enabling trusted early warnings, prescriptive actions that
    auto-close the loop in CMMS, and outcome-based commercial models backed by
    insurers. Edge-native architecture works reliably in offshore/subsea
    environments where generalist platforms struggle.

  character: >-
    Operations, maintenance, and service leaders at oil & gas equipment OEMs and
    operators who must keep pumps, compressors, BOP components, subsea trees,
    and topside equipment running safely and profitably.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned failures, harsh conditions, and data silos drive
    downtime and cost. Internal: Teams are stuck reacting, overwhelmed by
    telemetry, and under pressure to prove reliability. Philosophical: Critical
    energy assets shouldn’t fail when their data can warn us first.
  guide: >-
    Fleet Reliability & Predictive Maintenance CoPilot pairs oilfield
    reliability engineers with an AI platform built on industry standards (e.g.,
    API/ISO) and secure data practices. We understand the stakes of uptime,
    safety, and warranty exposure and translate raw telemetry and maintenance
    history into clear, actionable guidance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest sensors, SCADA/historians, CMMS, and maintenance/failure
    history. 2) Model: Build baselines, detect anomalies, estimate remaining
    useful life, and score risk with SME validation. 3) Act: Deliver prioritized
    alerts and recommended actions, trigger work orders/spares, and iterate via
    quarterly reliability reviews. Start with a 90‑day pilot, validate ROI, then
    scale fleetwide.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a discovery call to scope your pilot. Secondary: Request a
    demo and sample insights on a target asset class.
  success: >-
    Proactive maintenance, higher uptime, reduced maintenance spend, improved
    HSE risk posture, extended asset life, optimized spares, auditable
    reliability program, and more predictable service revenue and production.
  failure: >-
    Status quo persists: reactive firefighting, costly unplanned stops,
    increased HSE exposure, warranty leakage, customer dissatisfaction, wasted
    inventory, and missed production targets.
