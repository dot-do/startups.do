  problem:
    - >-
      Warranty costs and goodwill repairs are rising faster than machine ASPs;
      many OEMs see 2–5% of revenue consumed by warranty expense on new models
      within the first 24 months.
    - >-
      Telematics and fault codes are abundant but underutilized; signal-to-noise
      is low and alerts are generic, leading to alert fatigue at dealers and
      fleet owners.
    - >-
      Failures are often detected too late; mean lead time from first symptom to
      failure is <7 days for many subsystems (e.g., hydraulics, aftertreatment),
      leaving insufficient time to plan inspections and parts.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across telematics (AEMP 2.0 feeds), DMS/ERP, warranty
      systems, and service history, preventing closed-loop learning and
      validated ROI.
    - >-
      Parts availability is uncertain; lack of early visibility prevents kitting
      and drives emergency logistics costs and extended downtime.
    - >-
      OEMs need model-specific risk insights to trigger targeted campaigns, but
      existing tools aren’t failure-mode-centric and don’t link to actionable
      workflows.
    - >-
      False positives erode trust; current rule-based alerts lack calibrated
      confidence, burdening technicians and increasing ignore rates.
    - >-
      Large contractors and rental fleets demand uptime SLAs; poor early warning
      jeopardizes relationships and renewal rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion and normalization from OEM telematics, AEMP 2.0
      feeds, CAN bus snapshots, service/warranty systems, DMS/ERP, and
      environmental data (duty cycle, temperature, dust).
    - >-
      Failure Mode Library mapping FMEA/FMECA structures to codes, symptoms,
      parts, and repair actions per model/version/serial range.
    - >-
      Multimodal ML models producing per-asset, per-subsystem risk scores with
      calibrated confidence and estimated time-to-failure windows (e.g., 14–28
      days).
    - >-
      Campaign Orchestrator to auto-generate inspection cases for high-risk
      cohorts, prioritize by risk and customer impact, and assign to
      dealers/technicians.
    - >-
      Parts Kit Optimizer forecasting near-term parts demand linked to predicted
      failures; generates VIN/model-specific kits with alternates and
      supersessions.
    - >-
      Dealer and technician workflow integration (case routing, mobile
      checklists, photos, condition data capture) with closed-loop feedback to
      retrain models.
    - >-
      ROI and Quality Dashboards showing claim reduction, lead-time
      distributions, false-positive burden, MTBF shifts, and campaign
      effectiveness.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to DMS, PLM, and warranty systems to write back case
      updates, parts reservations, and claim outcomes.
    - >-
      Governance, privacy, and access controls by OEM, dealer, and customer
      tenancy with full audit trail.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict failures before they become claims: FHWR fuses telematics (AEMP
    2.0), SPN/FMI fault codes, service history, parts replacements, and warranty
    claims to forecast component-level risks 2–6 weeks in advance, automatically
    triggering targeted inspections and optimized parts kits through dealer
    workflows — reducing warranty expense 10–25%, cutting unplanned downtime
    15–30%, and increasing parts and service revenue with measurable ROI within
    6–9 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, warranty-labeled dataset tied to inspection outcomes and parts
    consumption enables faster model learning and defensible savings
    attribution; a failure-mode-centric knowledge graph and parts kitting
    optimizer convert risk scores into concrete technician actions and inventory
    plans. Prebuilt heavy-equipment connectors and AEMP 2.0 expertise shorten
    time-to-value versus general-purpose analytics platforms.
