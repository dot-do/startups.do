  problem:
    - >-
      Missed rainfall-triggered inspections due to manual weather checks and
      fragmented responsibility, leading to violations for failure to inspect
      after a qualifying storm event (often ≥0.5 in/24 hrs under many CGP/MSGP
      regimes).
    - >-
      Inconsistent and incomplete inspection checklists across sites and states;
      lack of standardization increases audit risk and weakens defensibility
      during enforcement actions.
    - >-
      Poor, non-searchable record-keeping (binders, spreadsheets, phone photos)
      causes delays producing documentation within regulatory timelines (often
      72 hours or less) and during annual reporting.
    - >-
      Difficulty proving whether an event was “qualifying” (on-site vs nearby
      gauges, start/stop times, accumulation totals) creates disputes with
      regulators and MS4s, and weakens the facility’s defense.
    - >-
      High administrative burden: EHS staff spend 6–10 hours per week per site
      chasing weather, checklists, and signatures; annual reporting can consume
      20–40 hours per site.
    - >-
      Field realities (remote pits, low connectivity, turnover) cause missed
      inspections, incomplete photo evidence, and unsigned reports.
    - >-
      Financial risk: fines commonly $5,000–$30,000 per violation, risk of
      consent decrees, and revenue loss from stoppages or withheld payments on
      public projects requiring demonstrated compliance.
    - >-
      Multi-state complexity: state-specific SWPPP, MSGP, and MS4 requirements
      change frequently; keeping templates and training current is difficult for
      lean teams.
  solution:
    - >-
      Event engine: Per-site geofencing and on-site/near-site gauge fusion
      detects qualifying storm events (configurable thresholds) and auto-creates
      inspection tasks with due dates and assignees.
    - >-
      Mobile-first inspections: Offline-capable app with GPS/time-stamped
      photos, required fields, corrective actions, and e-signatures; pushes to a
      secure, immutable audit log.
    - >-
      Defensible rainfall data: Source blending (NOAA + commercial radar +
      optional on-site tipping-bucket/IoT) with chain-of-custody metadata,
      start/stop times, accumulation totals, and distance-to-gauge recorded.
    - >-
      State-specific checklists: Prebuilt, versioned templates aligned to
      typical CGP/MSGP requirements for mining, editable per site; automatic
      updates with change logs.
    - >-
      Corrective action workflow: Auto-create, assign, verify, and document
      CAPAs with deadlines and escalation; link photos and retests to close the
      loop.
    - >-
      Annual reporting pack: One-click export of required logs (rainfall,
      inspections, visual assessments), training records, and CAPA summaries for
      audits and annual reports.
    - >-
      Sampling scheduler: Calendar for benchmark/effluent sampling windows, lab
      handoff sheets, and reminders; optional integration with labs for results
      ingestion and exceedance alerts.
    - >-
      MS4 awareness: Flag discharges to MS4 outfalls, apply stricter local rules
      where applicable, and store correspondence with MS4 operators.
    - >-
      Admin guardrails: Role-based access, SSO, site groups, and enterprise
      dashboards to view compliance status, upcoming commitments, and lagging
      sites.
    - >-
      APIs/integrations: Weather data, on-site rain gauges, email/SMS,
      e-signature, data lake export; optional Procore/Raken link for
      construction-adjacent operations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss a qualifying storm event again: automated, geofenced,
    rainfall-triggered inspections with defensible records purpose-built for
    sand & gravel mining. Reduce missed inspections by 80%+, cut admin time by
    50%, and standardize multi-state SWPPP/MS4 compliance in under 1 hour per
    site.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mining-first, rainfall-triggered compliance engine with defensible gauge
    fusion and chain-of-custody—plus a growing dataset linking storm events to
    inspection outcomes and enforcement results. Prebuilt, state-specific
    templates and consultant/insurer partnerships shorten time-to-value and make
    replacement by generic EHS tools costly and risky.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Small-to-mid construction sand & gravel producers (5–50 permitted
      sites) with lean EHS staff and frequent storm events.

  character: >-
    Aggregate mine owners, plant managers, and environmental coordinators who
    want zero‑lapse stormwater (SWPPP/MS4) compliance without extra paperwork.
  problem: >-
    External: Rain events trigger inspections, sampling, and reporting across
    sites and permits; manual tracking is fragmented and error‑prone. Internal:
    Teams worry one missed storm will lead to NOVs, fines, or shutdowns.
    Philosophical: Compliance should be automatic, clear, and auditable.
  guide: >-
    Designed for construction sand and gravel operations, the assistant maps EPA
    MSGP and common state permit requirements into timely actions, monitors
    weather, and prompts crews with the right checklist—backed by clear,
    audit‑ready logs.
  plan: >-
    1) Onboard site, permit, and inspection routes. 2) Connect rainfall sources
    (on‑site gauge or NOAA) and set thresholds. 3) Receive alerts, complete
    mobile checklists, and auto‑generate records and reports.
  callToAction: Start a 30‑day pilot or book a 10‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    Consistently meet storm‑triggered deadlines, keep audit‑ready records, avoid
    NOVs and fines, protect permits, demonstrate stewardship, and keep
    production on schedule.
  failure: >-
    Missed inspections, late reports, NOVs/fines, work stoppages, damaged
    reputation, and permit risk.
