  problem:
    - >-
      Elevated and volatile material costs (steel, aluminum, foams, resins,
      appliances) drive margin pressure on towable RVs, with limited visibility
      to cost-down levers at the line-item/spec level.
    - >-
      OEMs lack a structured, RV-specific database of compatible alternates;
      tribal knowledge and manual cross-referencing lead to slow, risky
      substitutions and ECO churn.
    - >-
      Supply risk (single-sourced parts, long lead times, import exposure)
      disrupts production; current tools do not jointly optimize cost and risk
      under RVIA/NFPA constraints.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/MRP, PLM, and supplier quotes makes it hard to
      quantify savings, PPV variance, and risk-adjusted total cost of ownership
      (TCO).
    - >-
      Engineering bandwidth is constrained; finding “good-enough” alternates
      that preserve performance, compliance, and manufacturability takes weeks
      per part.
    - >-
      Limited negotiating leverage due to lack of market benchmarks and
      index-linked pricing for key commodities and components.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest BOMs and purchase history from ERP/MRP/PLM; normalize SKUs and
      specs into a unified parts graph (appliances, chassis, electrical,
      plumbing, interiors, adhesives/foams, metals).
    - >-
      AI-driven alternate recommender: finds compatible parts, suppliers, or
      design tweaks (e.g., gauge changes, finish substitutions, pre-assembled
      modules) with quantified cost/savings and risk scores.
    - >-
      Constraint engine enforces RVIA/NFPA 1192/CSA, voltage/amp draw,
      fit-form-function, thermal/moisture performance, and safety ratings; flags
      where requalification or field tests are required.
    - >-
      Risk-adjusted TCO scoring: blends price, lead time, MOQ, quality PPM, OTD,
      single-source exposure, geographic/import risk, and commodity index
      outlook.
    - >-
      Automated RFQ and quote normalization: one-click RFQs to prequalified
      alternates; compares landed cost, terms, warranty, and tooling/NRE
      impacts.
    - >-
      Change control workflow: generates ECO/ECR packets, impacts analysis, and
      pilot-run plans; tracks PPV, realized savings, and defect escapes.
    - >-
      Commodity index tracker: links SKUs to indices (HRC steel, aluminum, PU
      foam, adhesives resins) and recommends index clauses or buy windows.
    - >-
      Cross-plant standardization suggestions: consolidate near-duplicates to
      boost volumes and leverage.
    - >-
      Warranty/field feedback loop: ties returns/claims to alternates to
      continuously improve recommendations and derisk substitutions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Deliver 2–5% reduction in material spend within 6–12 months by recommending
    RV-compliant alternates and low-risk design tweaks, prioritized by savings
    and supply risk. Realized, auditable savings in 90 days, with pilot-to-scale
    workflow embedded in your ERP/PLM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A defensible, RV-specific compatibility and performance dataset linking
    parts to real-world field performance, warranty outcomes, and compliance
    constraints—fed by closed-loop pilot data and multi-OEM deployments in the
    Elkhart cluster. This domain-rich graph plus validated alternates and ECO
    outcomes is difficult for horizontal procurement tools to replicate.

    Ops, procurement, and engineering leaders at travel trailer & camper OEMs
    (NAICS 336214) who must hit cost targets and protect schedules without
    compromising safety or quality.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile material prices, single‑source parts, long lead times,
    and supply risk inflate BOM cost. Internal: teams lack bandwidth and data
    visibility to vet alternates, fearing rework or compliance gaps.
    Philosophical: manufacturers shouldn’t have to choose between affordability
    and safe, reliable RVs.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect margin and uptime while meeting RV
    standards (e.g., NFPA 1192). Our AI analyzes your BOMs, AVL, and market/risk
    data to flag high‑cost items and propose vetted alternates or design tweaks
    with qualification evidence. Secure, auditable, and built for 336214
    workflows—engineering retains final sign‑off.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: read‑only integration to ERP/MRP/PLM and supplier data. 2)
    Analyze: identify cost/risk hotspots and rank alternates with specs,
    fit/gap, savings, and risk. 3) Validate & implement: engineering review,
    supplier qualification, controlled ECO, and rollout. 4) Monitor: track
    realized savings and supply risk with alerts.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30‑minute cost‑down pilot for 2–3 BOMs. Transitional: request
    a sample alternate‑sourcing report and a 336214 cost‑down checklist.
  success: >-
    Lower COGS, approved secondary sources, fewer shortages, shorter lead times,
    faster ECO cycles, compliant designs, stable production slots, and healthier
    margins.
  failure: >-
    Persisting overspend, stockouts, slipped build dates, emergency buys, eroded
    margins, and avoidable quality/compliance risks.
