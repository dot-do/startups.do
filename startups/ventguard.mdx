  problem:
    - >-
      Ventilation is 30–50% of underground mine power consumption; mines lack
      continuous, optimized control aligned to dynamic mining schedules and gas
      conditions.
    - >-
      Existing gas monitoring triggers alarms but does not combine with the
      ventilation model to predict methane layering, oxygen deficiency, or
      spontaneous combustion risk ahead of time.
    - >-
      Manual model updates are infrequent; the as-operated ventilation network
      often drifts from the as-designed model, leading to undetected
      bottlenecks, recirculation, or regulator mis-settings.
    - >-
      Coal-specific explosion hazards require conservative setpoints, limiting
      adoption of generic VoD (ventilation-on-demand) solutions designed for
      hard-rock mines.
    - >-
      Regulatory burden (e.g., MSHA 30 CFR Part 75, QLD CMSHR) demands
      meticulous reporting and audit trails; assembling compliant reports from
      disparate systems is time-consuming and error-prone.
    - >-
      SCADA alarms are noisy; high false positives (and some misses) reduce
      trust, slow response, and cause alarm fatigue in control rooms.
  solution:
    - >-
      Live data fusion layer ingesting methane/CO/O2, airflow, pressure, fan
      telemetry, door/regulator states, equipment and personnel location;
      filters and validates signals in real time.
    - >-
      Self-calibrating digital twin of the ventilation network (continuous
      balancing); flags topology drift (stoppings added, regulators changed) and
      recommends corrections.
    - >-
      Optimization engine computes safe fan speeds/regulator setpoints per
      panel/face based on production plan and measured gas loads; supports
      human-in-the-loop approval with safe envelopes.
    - >-
      Predictive hazard models for methane layering/explosion risk, spontaneous
      combustion (CO trend + temp), oxygen deficiency, recirculation; scenario
      simulation and early-warning alerts.
    - >-
      Automated playbooks and compliance workflows (MSHA/QLD reports, alarm
      rationalization, event timelines); complete audit trail of setpoint
      changes and operator actions.
    - >-
      Edge-first deployment for Ex-rated zones with cloud analytics; fail-safe
      design (advisory-only or supervisory mode, with trip logic remaining in
      certified PLCs/relays).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Coal-first AI agent that fuses live gas/airflow telemetry with the current
    ventilation model to optimize airflow and predict hazardous conditions
