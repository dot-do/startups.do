  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and custom applicators lose spraying days to wind, temperature
      inversions, and rainfast violations, causing re-sprays that cost
      $20–$35/acre and delay disease control.
    - >-
      Label compliance is complex (wind speeds, boom height, buffer zones,
      temperature/humidity, rainfast intervals); manual checks are error-prone
      and hard to document for audits.
    - >-
      High-resolution, field-level forecasts are underused; existing tools don’t
      combine label rules, drift risk, and crop disease windows into a single,
      actionable plan.
    - >-
      Small grains disease timing (e.g., FHB, leaf rust, powdery mildew)
      requires narrow application windows that are often missed without
      phenology-aware risk modeling.
    - >-
      Applicators lack audit-ready logs linking environmental conditions to
      applications, increasing legal and insurance exposure from drift
      complaints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse 1–3 km, hourly forecasts with label rules and product-specific
      rainfast intervals to produce go/no-go spray windows per field for the
      next 0–120 hours.
    - >-
      Quantify drift risk (wind, inversion probability, delta-T) and compliance
      likelihood per hour; automatically block hours outside label limits.
    - >-
      Run small grains disease risk models (e.g., FHB, leaf rust) using crop
      phenology and humidity/rain patterns to flag optimal efficacy windows that
      overlap safe spray windows.
    - >-
      Deliver mobile/SMS alerts, a daily spray plan, and a route-optimized
      schedule for custom applicators.
    - >-
      Generate audit-ready logs tying weather, nozzle/boom settings, products,
      and time stamps to each application; export to John Deere Operations
      Center, Raven Slingshot, Climate FieldView, and AgLeader.
    - >-
      Continuously learn from actual spray outcomes and on-farm sensors to
      improve forecasts and reduce false positives/negatives.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-level, label-compliant spray windows that minimize drift and re-sprays
    while aligning with disease risk peaks in small grains—delivered as clear
    go/no-go alerts and audit-ready compliance records.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously updated label-compliance and rainfast engine
    fused with mesoscale forecast calibration and phenology-aware disease
    models—validated in small-grains regions and embedded in applicator
    workflows with audit-grade logs and OEM integrations. The feedback loop of
    real spray + outcome data further improves risk scoring, creating a
    defensible data moat.

  character: >-
    Grain growers, farm managers, and custom applicators in small grains who
    need to spray on-label, protect yield, and avoid drift.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable micro-weather and complex labels make safe spray timing hard;
    wind shifts, inversions, and rainfast constraints turn every pass into a
    gamble, creating stress and compliance risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure and liability of spraying. Our AI combines
    high-resolution forecasts, label logic, and small-grain disease models to
    deliver clear, field-specific guidance you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Add fields and products with label constraints. 2) See green/yellow/red
    spray windows from wind, inversion risk, temperature/humidity, and rainfast
    data. 3) Get disease-risk alerts and spray with confidence.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free pilot for instant spray windows and alerts, or schedule a
    15-minute setup call.
  success: >-
    Timely, on-label applications with fewer resprays, lower drift risk,
    protected yield, and stronger neighbor relationships—spray right and sleep
    better.
  failure: >-
    Missed disease windows, off-target drift, wasted passes, fines, and damaged
    community trust.
