  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned ends-down events increase labor, waste, and off-quality. Typical
      ring spinning ends-down: 4–10 breaks per 1,000 spindle-hours; each break
      costs 30–60 seconds of operator time, 1–3 g of fiber waste, and
      incremental quality loss.
    - >-
      Traveller and spindle wear is hard to detect early. Over-running
      travellers by even 10–15% beyond optimal life can raise hairiness and U%
      by 3–5% and increase power draw by 1–2%.
    - >-
      Maintenance is reactive and calendar-based, not condition-based, causing
      both over-maintenance (wasted parts/labor) and under-maintenance
      (failures, fabric defects).
    - >-
      Spare parts stockouts and long lead times (2–6 weeks in many regions)
      cause prolonged downtime or force suboptimal settings.
    - >-
      Machine data is siloed (PLC/SCADA, winding clearer data, lab tests),
      making root-cause analysis slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Skill gap and high turnover among fitters and doffers increase variability
      in traveler changes, spindle lubrication, and ring rail settings.
  solution:
    - >-
      Install non-intrusive sensors (vibration, acoustic, current, temperature)
      at the frame/section level with gateway edge analytics; no per-spindle
      sensor needed.
    - >-
      Ingest PLC/SCADA signals (speed, ring rail profile), winding clearer cuts,
      lab QC (Uster), and maintenance logs to build a unified dataset.
    - >-
      Predict ends-down hotspots 1–24 hours ahead at frame/section level;
      recommend traveler changeouts, spindle checks, ring rail setting
      adjustments, and speed derates when necessary.
    - >-
      Estimate remaining useful life (RUL) of travellers and key spindle
      components; trigger condition-based maintenance and auto-create CMMS work
      orders.
    - >-
      Optimize spare planning by forecasting consumption/lead times; generate
      purchase requisitions to avoid stockouts.
    - >-
      Provide ROI dashboard: OEE, ends-down/1,000 spindle-hours, energy per kg
      yarn, traveller life vs baseline, and quality KPIs (U%, hairiness).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce ends-down and traveler/spindle wear-driven quality losses by 20–40%
    with AI-driven, cross-OEM predictive maintenance—minimal retrofit, fast
    payback (<6 months), and automated spare planning integrated to your
    CMMS/ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
