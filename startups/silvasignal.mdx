  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected harvests, windthrow, or canopy loss can go unnoticed for weeks
      due to infrequent patrols and persistent cloud cover, causing revenue
      loss, safety risks, and compliance issues.
    - >-
      Manual monitoring is costly (truck/helicopter time, staff) and often
      reactive rather than proactive, leading to delayed salvage and higher
      degradation losses.
    - >-
      Certification (FSC/PEFC) and regulatory (e.g., EUDR, LULUCF) audits
      require verifiable monitoring evidence; assembling this is time-consuming
      and error-prone.
    - >-
      Boundary breaches (over-harvest into reserves/neighboring stands) are
      difficult to detect quickly, exposing owners to fines, lawsuits, and
      reputational damage.
    - >-
      Storm damage (windthrow) needs rapid detection to prioritize salvage; each
      week of delay reduces recoverable value and increases pest risk.
    - >-
      Existing alerts are either too coarse (high false-positive rates) or too
      slow for operational forestry decisions.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (email, maps, spreadsheets) slow down incident triage and
      field response.
    - >-
      Stakeholders (insurers, mills, communities) increasingly expect
      transparent, timely reporting of change events.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring of customer-defined forest stands and boundaries
      using multi-sensor (Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2, Landsat; optional Planet)
      time series.
    - >-
      Automated classification of event type: likely harvest vs. windthrow vs.
      other canopy loss (confidence score), with change magnitude and area per
      stand.
    - >-
      Alerting via email/SMS/webhook with filtering by severity, size threshold
      (e.g., >0.2 ha), and geography.
    - >-
      Interactive web map dashboard and API/WMS to view events, validate,
      assign, and track resolution with full audit trail.
    - >-
      SAR-first detection ensures robustness under cloud/snow; optical confirms
      and refines attribution to reduce false positives.
    - >-
      Compliance exports (FSC/PEFC audit packs, EUDR-relevant change summaries)
      and quarterly/annual reports.
    - >-
      Mobile-friendly field workflows to navigate to events, capture
      photos/notes, and close out incidents offline.
    - >-
      Enterprise SSO, RBAC, and SLAs (latency, uptime) for operational
      reliability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near–real-time, stand-level detection and attribution of harvest, windthrow,
    and unexpected canopy loss using optical + radar satellite
    time-series—actionable alerts to the right person within hours, not weeks,
    with audit-ready evidence and seamless GIS integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated SAR+optical ensemble tuned for stand-level forestry events (not
    generic deforestation), backed by a large, curated, multi-region disturbance
    dataset with attribution to storm events, plus pre-built integrations with
    leading forestry software and audit-ready compliance packaging. This yields
    faster, more reliable alerts with lower false positives—and lower total
    cost—than general-purpose change detection solutions.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Forestry support teams—consultants, planners, stewardship and compliance
    leads—who need timely, trustworthy visibility of harvest, windthrow, and
    unexpected canopy loss across their holdings.
  problem: >-
    External: Canopy change happens between patrols and across remote tracts.
    Internal: Teams feel blind, reactive, and stretched thin. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t discover forest loss months after it happens.
  guide: >-
    We combine forestry know‑how with proven satellite time‑series analytics. We
    understand field constraints and deliver clear, validated alerts with an
    intuitive web map, so your team can verify quickly and act with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your forest boundaries and set alert preferences. 2) Our AI scans
    satellite time‑series to detect harvest, windthrow, and canopy loss. 3) Get
    email/SMS alerts and review changes on the web map to prioritize, dispatch,
    and report.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot on one management unit. Transitional: Book a
    15‑minute demo and receive a sample alert digest.
  success: >-
    Act within days, safeguard timber value, verify contractor activity,
    document compliance, reduce patrol costs, and keep stakeholders confident
    with a clear, auditable change log.
  failure: >-
    Miss unauthorized cuts and storm damage, respond late, overspend on patrols,
    face avoidable fines and disputes, and erode trust with landowners and
    regulators.
