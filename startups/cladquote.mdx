  problem:
    - >-
      Siding contractors waste 1–3 hours per proposal assembling scope, options,
      and inclusions/exclusions from measurements, photos, and supplier quotes.
    - >-
      Inconsistent scopes lead to scope gaps, change orders, and homeowner
      disputes; missing exclusions drive margin erosion and rework.
    - >-
      Contractors struggle to present Good/Better/Best options quickly with
      accurate material takeoffs and branded collateral, lowering close rates
      and average ticket size.
    - >-
      Manual e-sign, file storage, and CRM handoff create friction and delays
      (24–72 hours) that cause leads to go cold.
    - >-
      Existing proposal tools are generic (not siding-specific), require heavy
      manual setup, or don’t integrate cleanly with measurement sources and
      supplier SKUs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest measurements (HOVER, EagleView, Beacon 3D+, PDFs) and photos;
      auto-generate scope with line-item takeoffs matched to manufacturer SKUs.
    - >-
      Good/Better/Best options auto-built from curated templates (e.g., Vinyl
      vs. Fiber Cement vs. Engineered Wood) with dynamic pricing and margin
      controls.
    - >-
      Branded proposal builder with automatic inclusions/exclusions, warranty
      language, and code-compliant disclaimers by state.
    - >-
      Built-in e-sign, payment links, and financing offers; instant acceptance
      notifications and CRM sync.
    - >-
      One-click BOM export to suppliers; export estimate/invoice to QuickBooks
      Online; change-order generator tied to original scope.
    - >-
      Analytics on proposal turnaround, acceptance, average ticket uplift, and
      option selection trends.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From measurements to signed, branded, Good/Better/Best siding proposals in
    under 15 minutes—complete with inclusions/exclusions, manufacturer-correct
    SKUs, financing, and e-sign—reducing proposal time by 70–90% and lifting
    close rates by 5–15%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    measurement parsing, and outcome-trained upsell recommendations—strengthened
