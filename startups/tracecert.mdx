leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual COA/regulatory report creation is slow (2–8 hours/report) and
      error-prone, relying on copy/paste from LIMS/CDS/Excel/Word.
    - >-
      High compliance risk: inconsistent calculations, missing audit trails, and
      inadequate Part 11/ISO 17025 controls lead to audit findings and CAPAs.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across LIMS, CDS, instruments, and spreadsheets, making
      traceability and version control difficult to maintain.
    - >-
      Scaling reporting across methods, products, and sites results in template
      drift, version sprawl, and non-standard narratives.
    - >-
      QA review cycles are long (1–3 days) due to unclear change history,
      non-validated macros, and lack of automated spec checks.
    - >-
      Multi-language and client-specific formatting (e.g., pharma sponsors,
      retailers) require repetitive, manual rework.
    - >-
      Existing tools either lack domain-specific calculations/spec libraries or
      are generic document tools not validated for GxP/Part 11.
    - >-
      Contract labs lose margin to rework and report iterations; missed SLAs
      lead to penalties and churn.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to approved results/specs in LIMS/CDS/instrument files; map to a
      validated template library per method/product/regulation.
    - >-
      Apply a validated calculation/spec engine (units, uncertainty, rounding
      rules, out-of-spec logic) with a governed change-control workflow.
    - >-
      Use guarded AI (human-in-the-loop) to generate narrative text consistent
      with method/results, with explainability and redlines.
    - >-
      Provide end-to-end traceability: audit trail, versioning, reviewer
      annotations, e-signatures, and release packaging (PDF/A + machine-readable
      JSON).
    - >-
      Offer deployment options (secure SaaS, private cloud, or on-premises) with
      full CSV package (IQ/OQ/PQ) and Part 11-compliant controls.
    - >-
      Enable client/sponsor-specific templates and multi-language output to meet
      diverse submission and customer requirements.
    - >-
      Ensure continuous compliance: template validation library, regulation/rule
      updates, and change-impact analysis across all templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-ready COAs and regulatory reports in minutes with full
    traceability, validated calculations, and one-click e-signature—reducing
    cycle time by 70–90% and errors by 80% while meeting 21 CFR Part 11, ISO/IEC
    17025, and GxP requirements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, regulator-aligned template and calculation library with
    pre-built LIMS/CDS connectors and a guarded, explainable NLG
    workflow—combined with CSV artifacts and audit-ready change control—reduces
    validation burden and time-to-value competitors cannot easily replicate.

    regulated labs; supports ISO/IEC 17025 and GxP expectations with validated,
    audit-trailed workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & configure: Map LIMS/ELN data; define templates, specs,
    calculations, and approval rules.

    2) Generate & review: Merge approved results; auto-calculate; assemble
    narrative; flag deviations; route for e-signature.

    3) Release & trace: Publish versioned, traceable COAs/regulatory reports;
    export packages; maintain full audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    direct: Book a demo or start a 30-day pilot.

    transitional: Download a sample COA + validation pack and a regulatory
    reporting checklist.

    reports; shorter review cycles; clean audits; satisfied clients and
    regulators; scalable throughput with end-to-end traceability and version
    control.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means manual edits, version confusion, and copy-paste
    errors—leading to delays, deviations, audit findings, lost client trust, and
