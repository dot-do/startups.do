  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers in plate-work fabrication juggle cutting, forming, machining,
      fit-up, weld bays, cranes, inspectors, and paint/heat-treat with
      sequence-dependent changeovers—manual spreadsheets/ERPs can’t model these
      constraints, creating infeasible plans.
    - >-
      Due-date performance is volatile: frequent hot jobs, rework, and
      material/heat-number delays cause fire-fighting and overtime, increasing
      costs and eroding customer trust.
    - >-
      Weld bays are chronic bottlenecks; balancing operator qualifications,
      WPS/PQR requirements, and weld/fit-up times is difficult, underutilizing
      expensive bays and skilled labor.
    - >-
      Cutting and forming nests are optimized locally (CAM/nesting) but not
      globally across the job-shop; suboptimal cross-department sequencing
      amplifies WIP, crane conflicts, and queue time.
    - >-
      Existing APS/ERP schedulers are either generic (heavy to configure for
      plate-work) or cutting-centric (weak on weld/fit-up/inspection), leading
      to long implementations and low adoption.
    - >-
      Schedulers lack decision support for changeovers and batching;
      sequence-dependent setup times, tool/fixture availability, and bay
      readiness are not automatically optimized, leading to 5–15% wasted
      capacity.
  solution:
    - >-
      A plate-work specific finite-capacity scheduling engine combining
      constraint programming (CP-SAT), metaheuristics, and dispatching rules
      tuned to weld-bay and crane constraints.
    - >-
      Digital twin of resources (machines, bays, cranes, inspectors,
      operators/skills), calendars, setup matrices, and WPS/PQR/Welder
      qualification rules.
    - >-
      Daily/weekly auto-generation of feasible schedules; continuous
      re-optimization on disruptions (rush orders, breakdowns, absenteeism,
      material delays).
    - >-
      Scenario planning to compare trade-offs: expedite vs. overtime vs.
      subgrouping for changeover reduction; forward/backward scheduling with
      due-date risk scoring.
    - >-
      Tight integrations with ERPs/MES and nesting/CAM (e.g., SigmaNEST,
      ProNest, Lantek) to align cut lists/nests with downstream capacity and
      material availability (heat numbers).
    - >-
      Shop-floor execution support: prioritized dispatch lists, bay/machine
      visual boards, and feedback capture (start/complete/actuals) to improve
      model accuracy over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Out-of-the-box AI scheduling for plate-work that simultaneously optimizes
    cutting, forming, machining, and weld-bay flow with sequence-dependent
