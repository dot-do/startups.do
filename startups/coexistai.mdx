leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Multi-radio products (Wi‑Fi + Bluetooth + Zigbee/Thread + cellular IoT +
      UWB, etc.) frequently fail late-stage OTA/coexistence tests, adding 4–8
      weeks and $150k–$500k per SKU in rework, chamber time, and engineering
      labor.
    - >-
      Channel plans, duty cycles, LBT/backoff, and MAC parameters are hand-tuned
      using spreadsheets and ad‑hoc tests, producing unstable performance in
      dense 2.4/5/6 GHz environments and inconsistent field results.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity (FCC Part 15, ETSI EN 300 328/EN 301 893/EN 303 687,
      3GPP NR‑U LBT) makes pre‑compliance prediction and documentation
      burdensome, especially for SMEs without dedicated RF systems teams.
    - >-
      Current tools either focus on EM/antenna or protocol simulation in
      isolation; teams lack an end‑to‑end, validated workflow that ties measured
      traces -> environment models -> interference modeling ->
      white-space/channel scheduling -> parameter recommendations.
    - >-
      Poor coexistence decisions degrade user experience (drops, audio glitches,
      latency spikes), increase RMAs by 1–3%, and lead to negative reviews and
      lost contracts in industrial/medical deployments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Digital-twin simulator that ingests device radio stacks, antenna
      isolation, and environment models to simulate cross‑technology
      interference (Wi‑Fi/BT/Thread/Zigbee/LTE‑LAA/NR‑U/LoRa/UWB).
    - >-
      Optimization engine that recommends per‑radio channel assignments, duty
      cycles, LBT/backoff thresholds, ED levels, CSMA/CA parameters, and
      time‑slotting to meet throughput/latency/EMC constraints.
    - >-
      Auto‑calibration from measured data: import spectrum scans, OTA
      throughput/PER logs, and IQ captures to fit model parameters and narrow
      sim‑to‑chamber error.
    - >-
      Regulatory pre‑check: evaluates scenarios against FCC Part 15, ETSI EN 300
      328/EN 301 893/EN 303 687 and generates test plans/artifacts for
      certification labs.
    - >-
      Hardware‑in‑the‑loop: optional SDR or test‑equipment loopback to validate
      recommendations on benchtop before chamber booking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI‑assisted RF coexistence and channel planning that predicts chamber
    results within target error bounds (≤3 dB interference power error, ≤15%
    throughput MAPE), then auto‑generates channel plans, duty cycles, and
    LBT/backoff settings to cut OTA iterations by 30–50% and accelerate
    time‑to‑market by 3–6 weeks per SKU.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously expanding, proprietary dataset that links device logs and
    chamber measurements to AI‑calibrated models, enabling validated,
    cross‑standard recommendations that general tools cannot produce. Deep
    integrations with chip/test partners and a regulatory rules engine deliver
    end‑to‑end, audit‑ready outputs competitors struggle to replicate.

  character: >-
    RF lead/product architect at Other Communications Equipment manufacturers
    (NAICS 334290) building multi‑radio products that must coexist, comply, and
    ship on time.
  problem: >-
    Crowded spectrum and co‑located radios (Wi‑Fi, BLE, 802.15.4/Thread,
    Sub‑GHz, LTE‑M/NB‑IoT, UWB) cause unpredictable interference. Lab trials are
    slow and inconclusive, certification risk is high, and teams lack time/tools
    to model real‑world duty cycles, listen‑before‑talk (LBT)/backoff, and
    channel interactions.
  guide: >-
    RF Coexistence & Channel Plan Simulator is your AI guide—built by RF
    engineers and validated with standards and field traces. It models target
    environments, quantifies interference, and recommends channel plans, duty
    cycles, and LBT/backoff settings you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Define radios, traffic profiles, enclosure/antenna data, target markets,
    and environments. 2) Run simulations to visualize interference and receive
    optimized channel/duty/LBT/backoff recommendations. 3) Export the channel
    plan, test vectors, and a defensible report for design, QA, and
    certification.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 14‑day pilot or book a 30‑minute demo; request a sample coexistence
    report.
  success: >-
    Ship on schedule with a defensible coexistence strategy; pass certification
    the first time; hit throughput/latency KPIs; reduce field issues and lab
    churn; document compliance and design intent.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams face schedule slips, costly redesigns, certification
    failures, degraded user experience, and avoidable interference complaints in
    the field.
