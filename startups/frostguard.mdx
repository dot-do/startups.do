leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected or late-detected temperature excursions in freezers, reefers,
      and distributor storage cause product loss, rework, chargebacks, or
      recalls.
    - >-
      Manual retrieval/review of data loggers after delivery is too late to
      prevent losses; limited real-time visibility and alerting across partners.
    - >-
      Existing logger/telematics alerts are threshold-based and noisy; defrost
      cycles and door openings create false alarms with no product-risk context.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across plants, carriers, and distributors; difficult to
      maintain an audit-ready, end-to-end, chain-of-custody record under
      FSMA/GFSI expectations.
    - >-
      FSQA teams lack a quantified link between excursions and sensory impact
      (ice crystal growth, texture defects); hold/release decisions are
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      After-hours incidents are missed or escalations fail; no standardized
      playbooks or accountability for response.
    - >-
      Retailers and auditors increasingly require continuous monitoring and
      documented controls; generating reports is time-consuming and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with freezer controls, reefer telematics, and shipment loggers
      to unify real-time and historical temperature data without hardware
      rip-and-replace.
    - >-
      Apply ML anomaly detection tuned to frozen dessert profiles to filter
      benign events (defrost, door open) and flag actionable excursions.
    - >-
      Compute product-risk scores using mean kinetic temperature,
      time-above-threshold, and SKU formulation factors to predict sensory
      impact and remaining shelf life.
    - >-
      Provide alert orchestration with role-based escalation, on-call rotations,
      and SOP playbooks (driver instructions, divert/quarantine, maintenance
      checks).
    - >-
      Deliver end-to-end chain-of-custody timelines with immutable audit trails,
      e-signatures, and exportable HACCP/PC/SQF/BRC reports.
    - >-
      Offer analytics for route/lane benchmarking, equipment health signals,
      root-cause analysis, and CAPA workflow integration.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predictive, action-oriented cold-chain monitoring built for ice cream.
    Detects excursions early, quantifies sensory/food-safety risk, and
    orchestrates the right response—cutting loss and compliance risk while
    proving control to auditors and retailers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific risk models for ice cream and frozen desserts that
    translate raw temperature traces into sensory/shelf-life predictions (MKT,
    ice recrystallization kinetics), delivering fewer false alarms and more
    actionable alerts; cross-source data unification (plant, reefer,
    distributor) with accepted audit templates and prebuilt runbooks; deep
    connector library enabling rapid deployment without hardware replacement;
    early partnerships with insurers and major distributors to reinforce
    adoption and ROI.
