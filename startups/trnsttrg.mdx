leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High roadcall rates and service interruptions due to reactive maintenance
      and missed early warning signs from DTCs and telemetry.
    - >-
      Maintenance planners lack a prioritized, cross-fleet view of which
      vehicles need attention today versus can safely remain in service.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (AVM/telematics, EAM/CMMS, parts inventory, scheduling)
      create manual swivel-chair work to open work orders, order parts, and book
      shop time.
    - >-
      Parts stockouts and wrong-first-time repairs increase mean time to repair
      (MTTR) and reduce mean distance between failures (MDBF).
    - >-
      Electric and hybrid fleets lack robust predictive models for batteries,
      inverters, cooling loops, and high-voltage components.
    - >-
      Agencies struggle to quantify ROI on maintenance technology, making
      procurement and funding justification difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest DTCs and high-value telemetry (engine, aftertreatment, cooling, HV
      battery, brake/air, gearbox, doors, HVAC) via existing AVM/telematics and
      OEM feeds.
    - >-
      Risk-score each vehicle daily and intra-day using a hybrid of rules and ML
      sequence models tuned to transit duty cycles.
    - >-
      Recommend repair actions and parts kits with confidence scores; check
      inventory and lead times; trigger pre-picks and POs if thresholds met.
    - >-
      Propose shop windows based on block/run schedules and mileage targets;
      push one-click work orders into EAM/CMMS with labor/skill codes and SLAs.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: consume work order outcomes, fault clear times, and
      roadcalls to continuously improve precision/recall and ROI.
    - >-
      Dashboards and alerts for maintenance, operations, and execs: today’s
      high-risk vehicles, predicted failure modes, cost-per-mile trends, and KPI
      tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut roadcalls 20–40% and increase MDBF 15–30% within 6–12 months by turning
    raw DTCs and telemetry into prioritized triage, auto-suggested parts and
    shop windows, and one-click work orders integrated with your EAM/CMMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, transit-specific dataset and models tied to verified work order
    outcomes across multiple OEMs and EAMs, plus deep integrations that automate
    not just alerts but parts and shop scheduling—creating switching costs and
    measurable ROI agencies can take to procurement and boards.

    into ranked actions—securely integrated and proven to reduce unplanned work.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect telematics and EAM/CMMS; 2) ingest DTCs, duty-cycle, and health
    data; 3) AI risk-scores vehicles and recommends parts and shop windows; 4)
    auto-open prioritized work orders; 5) review weekly triage outcomes and
    refine.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot to see triage on your fleet.
  success: >-
    Fewer road calls and cancellations; higher pullout and on-time performance;
    smarter parts stocking; improved mechanic productivity; safer service;
    measurable cuts in unplanned downtime and cost per mile.
  failure: >-
    Without triage, firefighting continues—avoidable breakdowns, overtime, parts
    stockouts, audit risk, missed KPIs, and eroding rider trust.
