leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Irregular operations (IROPs) cause 1–2% cancellations and 20–30% arrival
      delays annually; 2–5% of passengers require reaccommodation, typically
      handled manually within hours, not minutes.
    - >-
      Contact centers see 200–500% call spikes during IROPs with $6–$12 average
      cost per call and long hold times that depress NPS and loyalty.
    - >-
      Rules-based tools miss early misconnect risk; late action causes lost seat
      inventory, compensation costs, and overnighting passengers.
    - >-
      Passenger communications are fragmented across email/SMS/app with
      inconsistent templates and languages; low engagement and no 2‑way
      acceptance yields confusion and airport queues.
    - >-
      Compliance exposure (EU261/UK261/DOT) and poor audit trails increase cash
      costs (meals/hotels/compensation) and regulator risk.
    - >-
      Interline reaccommodation and ticket reissue (ETKT/EMD) are complex;
      agents face inconsistent waiver policies and long after-service backlogs.
    - >-
      High-value customers churn after bad disruption experiences; a 1–3 point
      loyalty attrition can translate to millions in lost CLV per large carrier.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time detection of delays, cancellations, and misconnect risk by
      fusing flight status, tail/crew rotations, and connection risk ML models.
    - >-
      Automated reaccommodation proposals that respect fare rules, SSRs, MCTs,
      seat/ancillary preferences, loyalty status, and waivers—optionally
      auto-confirmed or routed for agent approval.
    - >-
      Omnichannel 2‑way passenger flows (SMS, WhatsApp, email, app/web) for
      accept/decline, alternates, voucher delivery, and policy disclosures with
      localization and accessibility.
    - >-
      Ticket exchange/reissue and EMD handling through PSS/NDC/Order APIs with
      full auditability and rollback safeguards.
    - >-
      Configurable playbooks per disruption type (schedule change, day-of
      cancellation, missed connection, downguage) with SLAs, throttles, and
      prioritization logic.
    - >-
      Agent assist console and CRM/CCaaS handover with full context when human
      intervention is needed.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Resolve disruptions in minutes, not hours: detect, optimize, and confirm
    reaccommodations with personalized, 2‑way passenger communications—reducing
    costs and raising NPS under airline-controlled rules and guardrails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A single, airline-grade engine spanning disruption detection, optimization,
    ticketing/EMD, and 2‑way comm—pre-integrated with major PSS and CPaaS—plus
    cross-airline learning that improves models and acceptance rates while
    reducing activation from months to weeks.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
