  problem:
    - >-
      Retailer/vendor compliance chargebacks (OTIF, ASN, labeling, carton
      dimension/weight, UPC mismatch) erode margins by 0.5–2.0% of gross
      wholesale revenue and are highly seasonal (Q3–Q4 spikes).
    - >-
      Shortage and damage deductions persist due to missing or fragmented
      documentation (PODs, BOLs, packing lists, GS1 labels, photos), leading to
      low dispute win rates and write-offs.
    - >-
      Routing guide rules change frequently across big-box and specialty
      retailers (Walmart SQEP/OTIF, Amazon VC chargebacks, Target, Michaels,
      Hobby Lobby), overwhelming small AR/compliance teams.
    - >-
      Dispute windows are short (often 30–60 days) and submission formats vary
      by portal; manual work causes missed deadlines and low recovery.
    - >-
      Poor EDI data quality (856 ASN, 810 invoice) and WMS/ERP mismatches
      trigger preventable fines; teams lack predictive alerts before
      shipment/invoice.
    - >-
      Lack of category-specific compliance knowledge (CPSIA/GCC certificates,
      ASTM F963, tracking labels, small parts/magnet warnings, battery hazmat)
      results in avoidable noncompliance fines and delayed receivables.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predictive risk scoring at PO/ASN/Shipment level to prevent fines (OTIF,
      ASN, label/packaging, carton dimension mismatch).
    - >-
      Auto-assembly of retailer-ready dispute packets with evidence (POD, BOL,
      packing list, photos, GS1 labels, EDI extracts, WMS scans), including
      retailer-specific appeal language.
    - >-
      Retailer rules engine and knowledge base (routing guides, SQEP/OTIF,
      Amazon VC chargebacks, Target compliance) monitored and updated
      continuously.
    - >-
      EDI/WMS/ERP integrations to validate data pre- and post-billing
      (850/855/856/810/820/864/997; carton/pallet data; carrier events).
    - >-
      RPA/portal automations for dispute submission and status tracking across
      major retailer portals.
    - >-
      Category-specific compliance checks (CPSIA/GCC docs, ASTM F963, small
      parts/magnets, battery hazmat, Prop 65 labeling) flagged pre-ship.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce retailer chargebacks and deductions for toy & hobby wholesalers by
    30–50% and recover 20–35% of disputed dollars with an AI that predicts
    compliance risk before it costs you, and assembles retailer-ready dispute
    packets automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-tuned models and playbooks built on toy/hobby-specific evidence
    sets (labels with age grading, small parts warnings, GCC/CPSIA docs, battery
    hazmat), plus a continuously updated retailer rules engine. Network effects
    improve predictions and appeal language as anonymized outcomes accumulate by
    retailer/DC/seasonality.

    Ops, finance, and compliance leaders at Toy & Hobby Goods and Supplies
    Merchant Wholesalers who want to stop profit leakage from chargebacks and
    deductions and keep cash flowing.
  problem: >-
    External: Retailers issue costly chargebacks and short-pays for EDI, ASN,
    routing, labeling, and packaging errors. Internal: Teams are stretched,
    rules change by retailer, and disputes are manual and slow. Philosophical:
    You should be paid in full for compliant shipments without fighting portals.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know retail compliance and deductions drain margin and time,
    especially with seasonal peaks and complex assortments. Authority: Our AI,
    trained on millions of retail transactions and expert playbooks, pinpoints
    risk and proves compliance with audit-ready evidence.
  plan: >-
    3-step plan: 1) Connect data (ERP, EDI, WMS, carrier, retailer portals). 2)
    Prevent issues with real-time compliance checks and alerts before ship and
    invoice. 3) Dispute and recover with auto-built packets (timestamps, POD,
    label scans, photos) filed and tracked to resolution.
  callToAction: Start a 30-day pilot or book a 20-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Reduce chargebacks 40–70%, recover 2–5% of revenue lost to deductions, cut
    dispute time by 80%, lower DSO, strengthen retailer scorecards, and refocus
    teams on growth.
  failure: >-
    Keep leaking margin, writing off preventable deductions, burning hours in
    portals, missing SLAs, eroding retailer relationships, and stressing cash
    flow.
