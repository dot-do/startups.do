  problem:
    - >-
      Missed or late-priced changes cause 2–5% annual gross margin leakage due
      to unbilled work, discounts, and rework.
    - >-
      Manual CO creation (email, spreadsheets, PDFs) adds 2–4 admin hours per CO
      and delays approvals by 3–10 days, extending project duration and cash
      conversion.
    - >-
      Inconsistent pricing and outdated rate books lead to under/over-charging
      and disputes; field staff lack an easy way to trigger a CO on-site.
    - >-
      COs are not reliably synced to estimates, job budgets, and accounting,
      breaking job cost visibility and WIP reporting.
    - >-
      Owners lack visibility into CO pipeline, approval bottlenecks, and
      variance drivers across crews, jobs, and materials.
    - >-
      Compliance and documentation for builders/insurers is inconsistent
      (photos, timestamps, homeowner sign-off), causing rejected or unpaid COs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multichannel detection of change signals from emails, texts, PM comments,
      photos, and voice notes; AI flags potential COs and drafts scopes.
    - >-
      Automated pricing engine using assemblies for common siding tasks
      (tear-off, WRB, flashing, trim, soffit/fascia) with localized labor rates,
      crew productivity, waste, and supplier price lists.
    - >-
      One-click CO creation with itemized scope, photos/annotations, and clear
      terms; mobile field capture (photo→scope, voice→text) for foremen.
    - >-
      Approval workflows with branded e-sign, configurable rules (owner vs.
      builder approvals), and auto reminders; options/alternates supported.
    - >-
      Two-way sync with estimating/PM and accounting to update budgets, POs,
      invoices, and WIP; automatic CO numbering and audit trail.
    - >-
      Variance analytics: before/after budget deltas, margin impact by
      job/crew/material, approval lead times, and recovery rates.
    - >-
      Role-based permissions, offline capture, and a compliant audit trail
      (timestamps, GPS, photo metadata).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Capture every change request, price it accurately in minutes, secure
    approvals fast, and automatically update budgets—protecting 2–4% margin and
    cutting CO cycle time from days to hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
