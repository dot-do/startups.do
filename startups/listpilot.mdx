  problem:
    - >-
      Listing creation is slow and inconsistent (20–45 minutes per listing) and
      often requires rewrites to meet Fair Housing/local compliance.
    - >-
      Pricing is guesswork or done with generic comps, causing prolonged
      vacancies or underpricing (1–5 extra vacant days = $50–$250 lost per unit
      per turn at $1,500/mo rent).
    - >-
      Syndication to portals is fragmented; formats, fees, and rules change
      frequently, leading to errors, duplicates, and stale listings.
    - >-
      Lack of unified performance visibility across channels; managers can’t see
      which copy, photos, price, or portals drive qualified leads and leases.
    - >-
      High staff turnover necessitates constant training on listing best
      practices and compliance.
    - >-
      Existing PM software lacks robust A/B testing, channel-level ROI, or
      SFR-focused pricing intelligence for small/mid portfolios.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted listing builder with Fair Housing and local phrase checks plus
      brand/style guardrails.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing recommendations using live comps, lead velocity,
      historical conversion, and neighborhood seasonality.
    - >-
      One-click, rules-based syndication to major portals; automatic updates on
      price, status, photos, and concessions.
    - >-
      Performance monitoring: channel/source analytics, cost-per-lead,
      lead-to-lease conversion, and days-to-lease by property and persona.
    - >-
      Automated A/B testing for copy, headline, photo order, and concessions
      with statistically valid rollups.
    - >-
      Approval workflows, roles/permissions, audit trails, and content
      versioning integrated with PM software.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create compliant, compelling listings in minutes, price them with live comps

  unfairAdvantage: >-
