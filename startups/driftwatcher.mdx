  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected test stand drift (sensor wear, temp/viscosity changes,
      hydraulic/pneumatic supply variation) causes false fails and escapes; many
      plants discover issues only during quarterly MSA or after customer
      complaints.
    - >-
      Static calibration intervals (e.g., 6–12 months) ignore actual usage and
      drift trends, causing unnecessary downtime or prolonged miscalibration;
      typical over/under-calibration cost ranges $25k–$250k/year per plant.
    - >-
      Operator-induced variation (setup, fixturing, warm-up routines) raises
      test result spread; operator-to-operator Cpk differences of 0.3–0.6 are
      common, leading to rework and throughput loss.
    - >-
      Data silos (PLC/DAQ logs, spreadsheets, MES) hinder real-time SPC; root
      cause analysis can take days and requires senior engineers.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop actions: alerts don’t translate to work orders, stand
      lockouts, recipe adjustments, or retraining; issues recur.
    - >-
      Inconsistent traceability and audit readiness (ISO 9001/TS/AS) due to
      incomplete test stand histories and calibration linkages, raising
      compliance risk.
    - >-
      Warranty and field returns from measurement escapes can cost 0.5–2.0% of
      revenue; root causes often tie back to EOL test drift or variation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge + cloud AI monitors EOL test stand signals (pressures, flows,
      torques, temperatures, electrical, cycle times) via OPC
      UA/Modbus/MQTT/CSV, learns normal behavior per
      stand/fixture/product/operator.
    - >-
      Uses change-point detection, Bayesian hierarchical SPC, and robust MSA to
      quantify drift, bias, repeatability/reproducibility, and operator effects
      in real time.
    - >-
      Action engine integrates with MES/CMMS (SAP PM, Maximo, eMaint) to open
      calibration work orders, lock out-of-tolerance stands, adjust
      guardbands/temperature compensation, and trigger operator retraining
      workflows.
    - >-
      Role-based dashboards and alerts (mobile/desktop) show live Cp/Cpk, Ppk,
      false fail/escape risk, and drift velocity; provides drill-down root cause
      trees (sensor, environment, setup, operator).
    - >-
      Auto-baselining per product family and per station compensates for
      seasonality and ambient/utility conditions; supports A/B tests for process
      changes and operator standard work.
    - >-
      Tamper-proof audit logs map every test to stand state, calibration status,
      and operator; exports for PPAP/AS9100/ISO audits.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem edge-first (Docker/K8s) with optional cloud
      aggregation; SOC 2-ready, supports SSO and site network segregation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Catch test stand drift and operator-induced variation in minutes instead of
    months; automatically trigger calibrations, lockouts, and work
    orders—cutting false fails 30–50%, escapes 25–60%, and rework/scrap 15–35%
    with payback in 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific, pre-trained drift models and MSA automation purpose-built
    for EOL testing in 333914; closed-loop action library that safely
    locks/adjusts stands across common PLC/MES stacks; growing cross-plant
    benchmark dataset enabling faster, more accurate detection than generic
    analytics platforms; OEM/integrator bundles lowering adoption friction and
    cost.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant quality and production leaders in NAICS 333914 (measuring, dispensing,
    and other pumping equipment) who need stable, audit-ready end-of-line test
    stands that deliver predictable yield and throughput.
  problem: >-
    External: test stand drift, miscalibration, and operator-induced variation
    silently degrade quality and throughput. Internal: teams firefight without
    clear visibility and debate root cause. Philosophical: quality shouldn’t
    depend on guesswork—machines should tell us when they change.
  guide: >-
    We understand EOL chaos in pump manufacturing. Drift Watcher AI separates
    process drift from product variability, integrates with PLC/SCADA/MES and
    data historians without disrupting production, and maintains secure,
    auditable records for compliance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect test stand data (files, OPC UA, historians). 2) Baseline healthy
    behavior and set guardrails. 3) Monitor in real time to detect drift,
    miscalibration, and operator effects. 4) Trigger actions: alerts, auto-hold,
    calibration work orders, recipe rollback, and coaching prompts; track
    results with dashboards and audit trails.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on one stand (deployment in under a week). Or request a
    free drift-risk assessment and readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Stable test stands, higher first-pass yield, fewer escapes, faster root
    cause, reduced scrap and rework, consistent operator performance, on-time
    shipments, and audit-ready traceability—often with payback within a quarter.
  failure: >-
    Without action, invisible drift compounds into scrap, rework, warranty
    claims, missed shipments, regulatory findings, constant firefighting, and
    eroding customer trust.
