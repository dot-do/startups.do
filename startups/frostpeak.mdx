  problem:
    - >-
      Summer demand charges (often 30–60% of total electric bill) spike when
      compressors and ice-makers run concurrently during hot afternoons.
    - >-
      Manual run scheduling is reactive and based on operator experience, not
      forecasts of ambient temperature, ice demand, or tariff windows.
    - >-
      Plants lack real-time visibility into approaching peak kW and cannot
      automatically stage equipment to avoid crossing demand thresholds.
    - >-
      Tariff complexity (TOU, ratchets, coincident/non-coincident demand,
      seasonal rates) makes optimal scheduling non-intuitive and prone to costly
      mistakes.
    - >-
      Existing SCADA/PLC systems typically control safety and sequences but
      don’t optimize for energy cost or demand charges.
    - >-
      Ice inventory constraints (bin capacity, harvest cycles, product
      quality/temperature) limit naive curtailment, requiring optimization that
      respects production SLAs.
    - >-
      Limited internal analytics resources to perform measurement and
      verification (M&V) of savings reduces confidence and budget approval.
    - >-
      Multi-plant operators lack standardized best practices and cross-site
      benchmarks to identify and scale wins.
    - >-
      Demand response opportunities are underutilized due to uncertainty about
      production risk and compensation.
    - >-
      Plants face increasing ESG and cost pressures; energy intensity per ton of
      ice is a material line item with untapped reduction potential.
  solution:
    - >-
      Forecast: Machine learning models predict hourly plant load 1–7 days ahead
      using weather, historical production, bin levels, and operating patterns.
    - >-
      Tariff engine: Ingests site-specific tariffs (TOU, seasonal, demand
      ratchets, DR incentives) to compute true marginal cost by hour.
    - >-
      Optimizer: Generates run schedules for compressors/ice-makers to pre-build
      inventory off-peak and cap on-peak demand at a configurable limit (e.g.,
      450 kW).
    - >-
      Real-time control: Optional closed-loop control via PLC gateway to stage
      equipment according to the recommended schedule; open-loop mode with
      operator prompts also supported.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware planning: Maintains minimum bin stock/service levels to
      avoid stockouts and protect order fulfillment during peaks.
    - >-
      Peak shield: Automated alerts when predicted demand is within X% of the
      site’s limit; one-click curtailment plan that preserves safety margins.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: IPMVP-aligned savings quantification, demand vs.
      baseline charts, and finance-ready reports.
    - >-
      Safety and quality guardrails: Hard limits on suction/discharge pressures,
      product temperature, and defrost/harvest cycles.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: Compare alternative schedules, setpoints, or demand
      limits before execution.
    - >-
      DR participation: Identify, enroll, and dispatch safe load reductions for
      DR events with pre-approved playbooks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut peak kW and electricity spend by 10–20% within the first season, with
    AI-driven forecasts and compressor/ice-maker schedules that respect
    production and quality constraints—no production surprises, just lower
    bills.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization library trained on ice-manufacturing load
    patterns and inventory constraints, pre-built PLC integration templates for
    common refrigeration systems, and finance-grade M&V that builds trust with
    CFOs. Early partnerships with major OEMs and DR aggregators create a
    distribution moat and data advantage that generic EMS vendors lack.

  character: >-
    Ice manufacturing operators and plant managers (NAICS 312113) who must hit
    daily ice output targets at the lowest possible energy cost—without risking
    product quality or equipment health.
  problem: >-
    External: Complex tariffs and compressor-driven kW peaks trigger costly
    demand charges and curtailment stress. Internal: Manual scheduling feels
    like guesswork, creating anxiety over surprise bills and missed delivery
    windows. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between meeting
    production targets and protecting margins.
  guide: >-
    We understand continuous, cold-chain-critical production and the realities
    of compressor cycling, defrost windows, and sanitation constraints. Our team
    blends industrial refrigeration know-how, utility-tariff expertise, and AI
    load forecasting to deliver clear, plant-ready run schedules and insights
    you can trust.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Integrate meters/SCADA/PLC data, tariffs, weather, and production
    plans. - Optimize: Forecast load and generate tariff-aware
    compressor/ice-maker schedules that shave peaks while meeting output. - Act
    & Verify: Deliver recommendations or control signals, monitor results, and
    provide M&V reporting with production-first overrides.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot at one site or book a demo. Transitional: Download the
    Ice Plant Peak-Reduction Checklist and run an ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Smoothed load profile, reduced demand charges and energy costs, predictable
    monthly bills, on-time ice production, healthier compressors, fewer alarms,
    and audit-ready KPIs for finance and sustainability—without new hardware or
    production risk.
  failure: >-
    Persisting with manual scheduling leads to preventable peaks, surprise
    demand charges, compressor wear, curtailment scramble, missed deliveries,
    and margin erosion.
