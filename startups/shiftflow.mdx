leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High idle and deadhead time: 25–40% of driver hours in many fleets are
      spent waiting or driving empty, depressing revenue per driver-hour and
      increasing congestion/fuel costs.
    - >-
      Spatial-temporal mismatch: Static shifts and ad-hoc repositioning create
      pickup hotspots with long ETAs in underserved zones, leading to missed
      demand peaks and lower completion rates.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone rostering: Excel-based or simple rules in dispatch
      software ignore demand forecasts, labor rules, break windows, and fairness
      constraints; results in overtime overruns and driver dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Weak demand anticipation: Limited use of external signals (weather,
      events, flight arrivals) causes under/over-staffing and surge dependence.
    - >-
      Adoption friction: Drivers resist top-down directives without transparent
      rationale, incentives, and measurable earnings uplift.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting at 5–15 minute granularity by zone using historical
      trips, weather, events, flights, and road conditions.
    - >-
      Shift and break optimization that meets labor/union rules, fairness, and
      vehicle-class constraints while targeting predicted demand profiles.
    - >-
      Real-time repositioning guidance for idle or near-idle drivers with
      incentive-aware recommendations and optional gamified acceptance nudges.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator for ops managers to test staffing plans, special
      events, or policy changes (e.g., airport queue rules) before deployment.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: measure outcomes vs. forecasts, adapt parameters by
      city/driver cohort, and auto-tune incentives.
    - >-
      Lightweight integrations: API/SDK to push missions to driver apps and
      ingest status from dispatch, meters, or TNC ops consoles.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase completed trips 5–12% and cut deadhead 12–20% within 90 days by
    generating compliant shift rosters and real-time repositioning plans tuned
    to each city’s demand—without increasing driver churn.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific optimization engine combining demand forecasts, labor/union
    compliance, and incentive-aware driver behavior modeling—plus prebuilt
    integrations with leading dispatch platforms and a proven pilot playbook
    that quantifies ROI in under 90 days.

  character: >-
    Operations and dispatch leaders at taxi and rideshare fleets who need the
    right drivers in the right place at the right time.
  problem: >-
    Volatile demand and manual rosters create long ETAs, idle time, deadhead
    miles, overtime, and churn—matching supply to demand shouldn’t be guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand fleet scheduling pain. Our AI planning service, built by
    mobility ops experts, turns demand forecasts and constraints into optimal
    shift rosters and repositioning plans.
  plan: >-
    Connect your trip, driver, and demand data; run a pilot in one market to
    calibrate rules and KPIs; deploy automated rosters and repositioning with
    continuous monitoring and refinement.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot to see impact on ETAs,
    utilization, and costs.
  success: >-
    Balanced supply and demand, shorter wait times, higher driver utilization
    and earnings, fewer empty miles and overtime, predictable schedules, and
    happier riders.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing schedules, miss demand spikes, pay for idle time and overtime,
    burn out drivers, increase churn, lose revenue, and frustrate riders.
