  problem:
    - >-
      High cost of late-found defects: paint flaws, mislabels, and assembly
      errors escaping station lead to rework, line stops, and field failures;
      typical rework cost per unit $150–$1,200 and 0.5–3 hours of lost capacity.
    - >-
      Fixed-camera vision systems are expensive ($75k–$300k per station),
      require downtime to install, and are inflexible when SKUs/fixtures change.
    - >-
      Human visual inspection is inconsistent; variable lighting and fatigue
      drive detection rates below 70% for subtle paint and labeling errors.
    - >-
      Traceability gaps: images tied to serials/VIN-equivalents are not
      systematically captured, complicating 8D/PPAP and ISO 9001 evidence.
    - >-
      Labeling compliance risks (ANSI/OSHA/EPA/CE) from wrong content, location,
      or durability; fines, recalls, or blocked shipments can occur.
    - >-
      Slow integration cycles with MES/QMS/PLM (3–9 months) delay value
      realization; IT/OT resources are limited.
    - >-
      Shop-floor connectivity is intermittent; many solutions fail offline or
      lack rugged mobile support.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app (iOS/Android, rugged-device ready) guides operators through
      station-specific capture with AR framing and lighting prompts; works
      online/offline.
    - >-
      On-device/edge AI models detect paint defects (runs, sags, orange peel,
      dust nibs), assembly completeness (presence/orientation), and label
      correctness (OCR + barcode, placement, content rules).
    - >-
      Auto-link images/videos to unit serials, build tickets, or work orders;
      push pass/fail with reasons to MES/QMS and log for PPAP/ISO audits.
    - >-
      Model lifecycle: start with transfer-learned defect libraries; fine-tune
      with 300–1,000 labeled images per class; continuous learning from feedback
      with human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      Compliance pack: rule sets for safety/environmental labels (ANSI Z535,
      OSHA/CE/EPA), torque/witness-mark verification, and bilingual labeling
      checks.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboards for FPY, DPMO, top recurring defects, heatmaps by
      station/shift, and model quality (precision/recall, drift).
    - >-
      Deployment playbook: 6–8 week pilot on 1–2 lines, baseline vs. post
      metrics, ROI report; scale-out templates for new SKUs/stations in <1 day.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Camera-in-pocket AI QC that deploys in days, not months: catch >80% of
    critical visual defects with only smartphones, improve FPY by 2–5 points,
    and create image-backed traceability per unit—without fixed cameras or line
    redesign.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific defect library and labeled dataset for construction
    machinery finishes, assemblies, and regulatory labels—captured under real
    plant lighting with reflective coatings—enables rapid, high-accuracy
    deployment on smartphones. Combined with on-device inference (<1s),
    AR-guided capture, and out-of-the-box MES/QMS connectors, Vision QC Lite
    delivers measurable FPY gains in days without fixed cameras.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production and Quality leaders at construction machinery manufacturers
    (NAICS 333120) who need fast, flexible, operator-friendly visual inspection
    without fixed-camera setups.
  problem: >-
    - External: Paint, assembly, and labeling defects slip through or trigger
    rework; fixed vision systems are costly and inflexible.

    - Internal: Pressure to hit takt time with lean teams; inconsistent manual
    checks; mounting warranty risk.

    - Philosophical: Quality should be as mobile and smart as your workforce—no
    cages, no capex, no bottlenecks.
  guide: >-
    Vision QC Lite understands line realities—moving stations, variable
    lighting, changing SKUs. Our smartphone-first AI has been trained on
    thousands of manufacturing defect images, delivers instant feedback, and
    fits IT/security requirements so operators can trust it and leaders can
    scale it.
  plan: >-
    1) Discovery (30 min): Define target stations and defect criteria. 2) Pilot
    (2 weeks): Capture sample phone images/videos; we train/tune models to your
    specs. 3) Go Live: Operators scan with phones for instant pass/fail +
    annotations; dashboards and API connect to MES/ERP for traceability.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and pilot scoping call. Optional: request a fast ROI
    snapshot using your rework/throughput data.
  success: |-
    - Catch issues at the station, not in rework or the field.
    - Standardize inspections across shifts and plants.
    - Reduce inspection time and variability without adding headcount.
    - Create a searchable visual audit trail linked to serials.
    - Scale QA across new lines and SKUs with zero fixed-camera capex.
  failure: >-
    - Missed defects leading to rework, delays, and warranty claims.

    - Slowed lines from manual checks and tribal-knowledge inspections.

    - Locked-in, expensive fixed vision systems that can’t adapt to changing
    workflows.
