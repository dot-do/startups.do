leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High curative workload: 60–70% of title files contain at least one
      curative requirement (liens, judgments, HOA estoppels, tax,
      subordinations), creating bottlenecks and overtime costs.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone processes: Outreach (fax/email/mail/phone) and letter
      generation are repetitive and inconsistent, leading to missed steps,
      rework, and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Long cycle times: Curative often adds 3–10+ days to file cycle time,
      impacting close-on-time SLAs with lenders and customer satisfaction.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems: Curative operations span TPOS
      (SoftPro/RamQuest/ResWare/Qualia), spreadsheets, email, eFax, and shared
      drives, causing status blind spots.
    - >-
      Limited managerial visibility: Supervisors lack granular metrics (aging by
      requirement type, first-pass yield, touch count) to optimize staffing and
      vendor mix.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit risk: Inadequate audit trails for regulator reviews,
      lender audits, and ALTA Best Practices (documentation of attempts,
      timestamps, templates).
    - >-
      Cost pressure: Fully loaded labor for curative ($35–$60/hour) drives
      $60–$150 per file in curative costs; carriers face margin compression with
      volume volatility.
    - >-
      Scalability issues: Volume spikes (seasonality/rate shocks) overwhelm
      teams; ramping BPO capacity takes weeks and introduces quality
      variability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse title commitments, searches, examiner notes, and requirements to
      classify and prioritize curative items using domain-tuned NLP/LLMs.
    - >-
      Auto-generate compliant letters/emails/faxes with carrier-approved
      templates for lien releases, payoff requests, HOA estoppels,
      subordinations, and affidavits.
    - >-
      Automate discovery and validation of counterparty contact info (servicers,
      HOAs, municipalities, law firms) with data enrichment APIs.
    - >-
      Orchestrate multi-channel outreach (email, eFax, mailhouse, SMS optional)
      with SLAs, retries, and escalation rules per requirement type.
    - >-
      Provide real-time status tracking, audit trails, and evidence capture
      (delivery receipts, timestamps, attachments) linked to the file and
      requirement.
    - >-
      Offer dashboards for WIP, aging, first-pass yield, touch count, and
      per-file curative cost; surface staffing/queue recommendations.
    - >-
      Bi-directional integration with TPOS (SoftPro, RamQuest, ResWare, Qualia)
      to sync requirements, documents, notes, and milestones.
    - >-
      Outcomes analytics to quantify savings (time and labor) and identify top
      delay drivers and counterparty bottlenecks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce days-to-clear and cost-per-file by automating end-to-end curative
    outreach, document generation, and status tracking—integrated with your
    title production system and backed by auditable, regulator-ready workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, continuously-improving dataset of curative requirements,
    counterparties, and outcomes across carriers—enabling higher automation and
    better contact resolution than generic RPA/IDP tools. Deep TPOS integrations
    and regulator-grade audit trails purpose-built for title curative, plus
    benchmark analytics that reveal delay drivers by counterparty/state
    unavailable to in-house or BPO-only approaches.
