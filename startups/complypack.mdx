  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented and evolving regulations across markets (EPA 40 CFR Parts
      1054/1060/1068, CARB Title 13, EU RoHS 2011/65/EU, EU Outdoor Noise
      Directive 2000/14/EC, CE/EMC/LVD/RED, UKCA) make it slow and error-prone
      to assemble market-ready packs per model before shipment.
    - >-
      Manual compilation of Certificates of Conformity, Executive Orders,
      Declarations of Conformity, labels, and owner-manual statements typically
      takes 8–20 hours per model per market and often repeats each model-year
      change.
    - >-
      Labeling errors (e.g., incorrect LWA, missing EPA/CARB statements,
      incorrect CE symbol sizing) cause rework, shipment holds, and scrappage of
      pre-printed labels; observed error rates 5–12% in mid-sized OEMs.
    - >-
      Engine and evaporative system documentation mapping (engine family IDs,
      evaporative component part numbers, fuel tank permeability) to equipment
      models is inconsistent; high risk of mismatches during audits.
    - >-
      BOM material compliance (RoHS/REACH) and supplier declarations are siloed
      from emissions/noise compliance, leading to incomplete packs and audit
      exposure.
    - >-
      Poor traceability and audit trail (who approved what, when) complicates
      CARB/EPA recordkeeping and EU DoC technical file obligations (10-year
      retention).
    - >-
      Late-stage compliance discovery delays new model releases and export
      shipments (1–6 weeks delay), impacting revenue and dealer availability
      during peak seasons.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rules engine maps product attributes (engine family, displacement, power,
      fuel system, handheld vs non-handheld, electric vs ICE, wireless modules)
      to exact regulatory obligations per market and model-year.
    - >-
      Automated document assembly: pulls EPA Certificates of Conformity, CARB
      Executive Orders, EU DoCs, test reports, material declarations (RoHS),
      owner-manual required statements; outputs a single pack PDF/ZIP with index
      and checksum.
    - >-
      Label and marking generator: produces compliant artwork (EPA family/evap
      labels, CARB hangtags, CE/UKCA marks with correct dimensions, guaranteed
      LWA labels under 2000/14/EC, WEEE/Prop 65 where applicable) including QR
      codes linking to digital technical file.
    - >-
      Noise compliance workflow: imports sound power test data (ISO 3744/3747)
      and calculates declared/guaranteed LWA and tolerances; validates equipment
      categories covered by the Outdoor Noise Directive and label content.
    - >-
      BOM compliance ingestion: aggregates supplier declarations (IPC-1752A, IEC
      62474), flags RoHS exemptions, and auto-generates material compliance
      sections for DoC/technical file.
    - >-
      Integration connectors: PLM (Windchill, Teamcenter, Arena), ERP (NetSuite,
      SAP), PDM (SolidWorks), label printers (Zebra, Brady) to eliminate
      duplicate data entry.
    - >-
      Gap check and change impact: detects missing or mismatched documents
      (e.g., engine family not listed on CoC), and highlights regulatory changes
      affecting current models.
    - >-
      Audit trail and e-sign: role-based approvals, timestamped decisions, and
      retention policies aligning with EPA/CARB/EU technical file requirements.
    - >-
      Multi-market release gating: prevents shipment release in WMS/ERP until
      required market packs are approved for that model/region.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate, validate, and approve per-market compliance packs
    (EPA/CARB/CE/RoHS/Noise/UKCA) for each model in minutes—not days—with a
    domain-trained rules engine, label automation, and audit-ready traceability
    that cuts time-to-ship by 60–80% and reduces labeling errors below 0.5%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific knowledge graph pre-mapped to 333112 equipment categories,
    engine families, and evaporative systems—co-developed with labs and engine
    suppliers—plus a production-ready label generator and template library
    covering EPA/CARB/CE/Noise with audit-grade traceability. Competitors lack
    the combined emissions, materials, and noise automation tailored to outdoor
    power equipment.
