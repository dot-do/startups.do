  title: AI Visual Defect Screening for Ammunition Components
  description: >-
    Computer-vision inspection of cartridge components (e.g., cases,
    projectiles, primers) from uploaded images/video to flag cosmetic and
    dimensional anomalies per company-defined acceptance criteria.
  targetUsers:
    - QA managers
    - Production supervisors
    - Process/CI engineers
  triggers:
    - New lot produced and ready for inspection
    - 'Scheduled sampling (e.g., every X pallets)'
    - Ad-hoc reinspection after a complaint
  inputs:
    - Sample/batch images or short videos (consistent lighting)
    - Company-defined acceptance criteria and defect taxonomy
    - Historical labeled examples (if available)
    - Lot/shift metadata
  steps:
    - Secure ingest of images via S3/SharePoint/SFTP or browser upload
    - >-
      Model setup: fine-tune defect detector on customer’s labels; augment for
      lighting/angle
    - >-
      Batch inference; uncertainty sampling to route borderline cases to
      reviewer
    - Reviewer UI for quick accept/reject/label correction
    - Generate lot-level defect summary and trend report; export to QMS/MES
    - 'Continuous learning: retrain on reviewed edge cases'
  tools:
    - OpenCV
    - Ultralytics/YOLO or Detectron2
    - FiftyOne/Roboflow
    - AWS S3/Lambda or GCP Cloud Run
    - FastAPI/Streamlit reviewer UI
  outputs:
    - Per-lot defect counts by type
    - Annotated images and confidence scores
    - Pass/hold recommendations with audit trail
    - CSV/API feed to QMS/MES and dashboards
  pricingModel:
    - One-time setup/model tuning fee

  risks:
    - False rejects/escapes if dataset drifts
    - Lighting/camera variability affecting performance
    - Data handling/privacy of production imagery
    - Needs ongoing labeling for rare defects
  dependencies:
    - Access to labeled/unlabeled images
    - Acceptance criteria and defect taxonomy
    - Integration to QMS/MES (optional)

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual inspection of cartridge components is inconsistent, slow, and
      costly; typical human detection recall 70–85% with high fatigue-related
      variance.
    - >-
      Traditional rule-based machine vision struggles with highly reflective
      brass/copper finishes, subtle cosmetic defects, and SKU changeovers,
      causing false rejects >5% or missed defects.
    - >-
      Dimensional conformance checks (length, concentricity, surface anomalies)
      are fragmented across gauges and offline sampling, leaving gaps between
      in-line process control and final quality acceptance.
    - >-
      Customer returns, warranty claims, and rejected lots (AQL failures) create
      unplanned costs, reputational risk, and schedule slips for OEMs and
      contract manufacturers.
    - >-
      Quality teams lack a unified, traceable defect analytics layer (by
      lot/SKU/line/shift), limiting root-cause analysis and continuous
      improvement.
    - >-
      Integrating inspection data with MES/SCADA/PLC systems is non-trivial;
      many sites have air-gapped or export-controlled environments that require
      on-premise, secure deployments.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered visual inspection from images/video to screen cosmetic and
      dimensional anomalies against customer-defined acceptance criteria and
      sampling plans.
    - >-
      Specialized models for reflective metallic surfaces (brass, copper,
      nickel), trained on ammunition component defect patterns; supports
      semi-supervised learning for rapid onboarding of new SKUs.
    - >-
      Calibrated 2D dimensional checks (e.g., overall length proxies, mouth
      out-of-round proxies, head area features) with camera and lighting
      calibration; optional integration with existing gauges for ground-truth.
    - >-
      Configurable rules engine to encode plant-specific acceptance criteria
      (aligned to internal standards), lot genealogy, and AQL sampling plans.
    - >-
      Operator console for real-time pass/fail decisions, human-in-the-loop
      review, and rapid reason coding.
    - >-
      Analytics and reporting: defect Pareto by SKU/line/shift/lot, trend
      analysis, first-pass yield, and traceability exports.
    - >-
      Industrial integrations: OPC UA/Modbus/TCP for PLCs, APIs for
      MES/SCADA/LIMS, and secure on-prem/edge deployment for export-controlled
      or air-gapped networks.
    - >-
      MLOps services: dataset curation, re-training, and model validation with
      versioned acceptance criteria and automated performance monitoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pretrained, ammunition-specific computer vision that deploys in weeks,
    adapts across SKUs, and achieves >95% defect detection recall with <2% false
    reject rate on reflective metallic components—while providing traceable,
    audit-ready quality records and seamless on-prem or edge deployment for
    controlled environments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Ammunition-focused, reflective-metal-trained models and a curated defect
    dataset not easily replicated; rapid SKU onboarding workflows;
    acceptance-criteria rules engine with traceability; and established
    integrator/hardware partnerships enabling fast, validated deployments in
    controlled manufacturing environments.
