  problem:
    - >-
      Monitoring dozens of procurement portals (SAM.gov, state/local, school
      districts, Bonfire, OpenGov, BidNet) consumes 8–15 hours/week for SMBs in
      All Other Business Support Services (NAICS 561499) and still misses
      opportunities.
    - >-
      RFPs are long (50–200+ pages) and inconsistent; summarizing requirements
      and extracting a compliance matrix takes 2–6 hours per RFP and is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Go/No-Go decisions are ad hoc; teams struggle to assess fit (set-asides,
      certifications, size standards, past performance, geography,
      bonding/capacity), leading to low win rates (<10% typical for small firms)
      and wasted proposal spend ($3k–$15k per bid).
    - >-
      Deadlines, Q&A, and addenda tracking are fragmented; missed dates and
      non-compliant submissions are common.
    - >-
      First-draft proposal outlines are built from scratch or reused poorly;
      aligning to Section L/M or equivalent instructions takes 2–8 hours and
      often misses mandatory elements.
    - >-
      Knowledge (boilerplate, past answers, resumes, case studies) is scattered
      across drives and email; re-use is low and inconsistent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate to procurement sources (SAM.gov, state portals, cities/counties,
      school districts, Bonfire, OpenGov, BidNet, DemandStar) with
      API/use-permitted crawlers; de-duplicate and normalize notices.
    - >-
      Profile builder captures capabilities (NAICS/UNSPSC codes, service lines),
      certifications (SBE/MBE/WBE/DBE/8(a)), geography, staffing capacity,
      bonding/insurance, past performance, target contract values.
    - >-
      AI-driven matching and Go/No-Go scoring (0–100) using rules + ML that
      considers set-aside eligibility, scope similarity, location/logistics,
      period of performance, contract value, incumbent intel when available.
    - >-
      RFP summarization and compliance matrix extraction (deliverables, key
      dates, mandatory forms, insurance, evaluation criteria) with risk flags
      (e.g., unattainable SLAs, unfavorable terms).
    - >-
      Response outline generator mapped to instructions/evaluation factors;
      auto-inserts boilerplate, past performance snippets, resumes; exports to
      Word/Google Docs; includes a pricing workbook skeleton if applicable.
    - >-
      Workflow: shared calendar for deadlines/Q&A, reminders, assignments,
      Slack/Teams notifications; integrates with CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce) to
      track pipeline and outcomes.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: collect overrides (fit/no-fit), outcomes
      (win/loss), and content usage to improve matching and outline quality over
      time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Win more public-sector bids with 70% less effort: always-on AI monitors
    1,200+ portals, scores fit against your capabilities, and delivers compliant
    response outlines tailored to your past wins—so your team focuses on
    strategy, not triage.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-tuned matching and compliance models for business support services,
    trained on a growing, proprietary corpus of RFPs and client outcomes;
    closed-loop learning from Go/No-Go overrides and win/loss data; deep portal
    coverage with de-duplication; partnerships with PTACs/consultants providing
    distribution and embedded services; integrated compliance matrix and outline
    generation that map directly to Section L/M-style instructions, reducing
    non-compliance risk.
