leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive in multiple formats (email, portals) with mixed CAD and spec
      attachments; manual triage and data entry consume 1–3 hours per RFQ.
    - >-
      Estimating requires scarce tribal knowledge (machine tonnage,
      gating/yield, cycle time) leading to inconsistent and error-prone quotes;
      experienced estimators are retiring and hard to replace.
    - >-
      Quote lead times (2–5 days) miss customer decision windows and reduce win
      rates; late quotes are rarely awarded.
    - >-
      Cost volatility (alloy price, energy) is not reflected consistently,
      causing margin leakage or uncompetitive pricing.
    - >-
      Current tools (spreadsheets/ERP modules) are not CAD-driven; simulation is
      too slow for quoting; general-purpose quoting software lacks die-casting
      physics.
    - >-
      Quoting workload is spiky (RFX bursts) creating bottlenecks and overtime
      or missed RFQs.
    - >-
      No closed-loop: actuals (cycle time, scrap, metal yield) rarely feed back
      to improve future quotes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified RFQ intake: Monitor shared inboxes/portals; auto-extract RFQ data,
      due dates, revisions, and attach CAD/specs.
    - >-
      CAD-driven estimation: Parse STEP/IGES/Parasolid/SolidWorks/NX/Inventor;
      compute volume, projected area, thickness histogram, cored features,
      parting line candidates.
    - >-
      Machine selection: Estimate clamp tonnage from projected area and
      alloy-specific injection pressure; map to in-fleet presses, shot size, die
      size, tie bar spacing.
    - >-
      Cycle time model: Physics-informed ML for fill + solidification/cooling,
      shot sleeve, spray/lube, open/close, trim; includes setup and changeover
      time by family/tooling state.
    - >-
      Yield and material usage: Estimate gates/runners/overflows, biscuit,
      expected scrap/reclaim rate; compute net metal, chips/burr, and recycling
      credit by alloy.
    - >-
      Cost stack: Machine hourly rate, labor, energy (kWh/shot), consumables
      (lube, shot sleeve wear), QA, secondary ops (tapping, machining),
      packaging, freight; optional tool amortization.
    - >-
      Commercial quote draft: Price ladder by volume tiers, lead time, payment
      terms; margin slider; risk flags; customer-ready PDF/email and CRM
      opportunity auto-creation.
    - >-
      Confidence and audit: Line-item confidence scores; traceability to
      geometry features and historical analogs; scenario compare (“thin wall
      risk,” “press change”).
    - >-
      Integrations: Push to ERP/MES (Plex, Epicor, Infor CSI, E2/JobBOSS) and
      CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot); pull alloy/energy price feeds; SSO; on-prem or
      VPC option.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: Ingest awarded quotes and production actuals (cycle
      time, scrap, metal yield) to continuously calibrate models per foundry.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs and CAD into draft, auditable quotes in under 1 hour with
    die-casting–specific physics + AI. Standardize estimating, cut quote lead
    time by 70–90%, and improve margin accuracy to within ±5–10% of actual cost
    while integrating seamlessly with your ERP/CRM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Die-casting–specific physics+ML stack trained on multi-foundry datasets with
    closed-loop feedback from ERP actuals, plus deep CAD analytics and
    NADCA-aligned heuristics. Email-to-quote automation and calibration per
    press fleet enable high accuracy quickly—capabilities generic quoting tools
    and spreadsheets lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations/Estimating Manager or Sales Engineer at a nonferrous metal
    die‑casting foundry (NAICS 331523) who wants to turn RFQs and CAD into
    accurate quotes in minutes—so they win profitable work without bottlenecks.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive with drawings, CAD, and partial specs; manual
    estimation is slow, error‑prone, and dependent on a few experts.

    Internal: You’re juggling spreadsheets and cycle‑time guesses, working
    nights, and worrying about underquoting.

    Philosophical: Precision manufacturers shouldn’t lose or regret jobs because
    quoting is guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand die‑casting quoting—machine selection, cavitation,
    cycle time, alloy usage, secondary ops, and scrap are complex under time
    pressure.

    Authority: Purpose‑built AI for nonferrous die‑casting, developed with
    process engineers, validated on historical RFQs/CAD, and designed to
    integrate with your ERP/CRM while keeping your data in your control.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect RFQ inbox/portal and CAD files.

    2) Configure machines, alloys, labor rates, overhead, scrap, and business
    rules.

    3) Autopilot estimates machine/tonnage, die size/cavitation, cycle time,
    material usage, secondary ops, and total cost; drafts a customer‑ready
    quote.

    4) Review, adjust, approve, and sync to CRM/ERP.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Clear pricing; no long‑term lock‑in.

    - Your data remains yours; access controls and private deployment options.

    - Start small: pilot on past RFQs with agreed success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo; start a 30‑day pilot with your RFQs and CAD.

    Transitional: Download a sample quote, ROI calculator, and implementation
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Quotes in minutes, not days. Higher win rates with consistent, defensible
    pricing. Protected margins and fewer underquotes. Transparent assumptions
    and audit trails. A scalable quoting process that outlives tribal knowledge.
  failure: >-
    Slow, inconsistent quoting; lost bids to faster shops; underquoted jobs that
    erode margin; expert burnout; fragile processes tied to a few people; lumpy,
