  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers lose 30–50% of digital leads due to slow or no follow-up,
      especially after hours and on weekends.
    - >-
      BDC/sales staff churn and schedule gaps create inconsistent coverage and
      response quality.
    - >-
      Generic autoresponders and basic chatbots fail to qualify needs (tow
      rating, sleeping capacity, budget, new vs. used) and don’t map to live
      inventory, wasting buyer intent.
    - >-
      Manual appointment coordination (back-and-forth) causes drop-off and low
      show rates.
    - >-
      CRM hygiene is poor: duplicate leads, missing dispositions, and no
      closed-loop feedback to optimize ad spend.
    - >-
      High paid-lead costs ($35–$120 per lead from marketplaces) are squandered
      without speed-to-lead and structured follow-up.
    - >-
      Compliance risk (TCPA/CASL) and inconsistent opt-out management create
      legal exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      24/7 AI agent engages via SMS, web chat, Facebook Messenger, and email
      within 60 seconds of lead arrival.
    - >-
      Dynamic qualification: budget, timeline, use case (full-time vs. weekend),
      tow vehicle and capacity, sleeping capacity, preferred brands, new/used,
      trade-in.
    - >-
      Inventory-matching engine ranks units by fit and availability using dealer
      DMS/website feeds; shares links, photos, and key specs in-thread.
    - >-
      Instant appointment setting: two-way calendar booking with reminders,
      reschedule links, and salesperson assignment rules.
    - >-
      Seamless CRM writeback and tasking with standardized dispositions and
      notes; triggers for human handoff when needed.
    - >-
      Compliant messaging with consent checks, opt-out handling, and
      jurisdiction-aware templates (TCPA/CASL).
    - >-
      Performance loop: A/B test scripts, track set/show/sold outcomes, and
      optimize recommendations and timing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase appointments and sold units by engaging every RV lead in under 60
    seconds, 24/7, with an AI that qualifies needs, recommends in-stock units,
