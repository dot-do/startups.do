  problem:
    - >-
      Tobacco manufacturers and importers face constantly changing excise/duty
      rules across 150+ countries and hundreds of sub-national jurisdictions;
      manual spreadsheets and static rules in ERP/CPQ cause pricing errors and
      margin leakage.
    - >-
      Quoting and order entry teams lack real-time visibility of total landed
      excise costs for different product formats (stick count, weight, nicotine
      strength, heated tobacco, pouches), leading to slow quote cycles and
      inconsistent pricing.
    - >-
      Regulatory change management is reactive; updates from gazettes and
      customs notices reach pricing systems weeks later, increasing audit and
      penalty risk.
    - >-
      Auditable evidence for how a tax was calculated (inputs, rule versions,
      sources) is scattered; proving correctness during audits consumes weeks
      and external advisory fees.
    - >-
      Existing generic tax engines are not tobacco-specific, missing product
      taxonomy nuances (e.g., MLP vs WAP, minimum specific amounts, tiered
      rates, track-and-trace stamp fees), causing misclassification and rework.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-updated rules engine purpose-built for tobacco that maps product
      attributes to correct tax treatments across jurisdictions (specific/ad
      valorem/mixed/minimums, tiering, pack sizes, stamp fees).
    - >-
      Pre-built connectors to CPQ/ERP (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, Salesforce CPQ) to
      calculate duties at quote and order time; batch pricing for price lists
      and tenders.
    - >-
      Regulatory change detection pipeline (NLP on gazettes/tax authority sites)
      with human-in-the-loop legal review; SLA to push validated changes within
      5 business days.
    - >-
      Auditable calculation ledger storing inputs, rule versions, sources, and
      outputs; one-click export of evidence packs for auditors.
    - >-
      Scenario and sensitivity modeling (what-if for product spec changes,
      destination routing, incoterms) to protect margins pre-quote.
    - >-
      Global classification assistant: HS codes/excise categories mapped to
      tobacco product taxonomy (sticks, grams, nicotine mg, heated tobacco
      units).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, tobacco-specific excise/duty calculation and scenario pricing,
    injected directly into your quotes/orders with a tamper-proof audit
    trail—reducing quote cycle time by 30–50%, cutting tax errors to <0.1%, and
    making audits 5x faster.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A tobacco-specific regulatory change graph tied to executable rules,
    enriched by proprietary SKU-to-taxonomy mappings and a large, curated
    historical dataset of excise/stamp outcomes—validated through continuous
    client regression tests and auditor-reviewed evidence packs.
