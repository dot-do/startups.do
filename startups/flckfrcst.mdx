  title: 'Mortality, Weight, and FCR Forecasting'
  description: >-
    Predicts daily mortality, average weight, FCR, and EPEF 7–14 days ahead to
    support proactive interventions and planning.
  targetUsers:
    - Growers
    - Flock supervisors
    - Integrators
    - Processing plant planners
  triggers:
    - Nightly batch run
    - Manual on-demand forecast
    - Placement of new flock
  inputs:
    - Daily feed/water intake per house
    - Mortality/culls per day
    - Bird scales (auto/manual)
    - Temp/Humidity/CO2 history
    - 'Placement details (strain, gender, chick quality, density)'
  steps:
    - Clean/align time series and fill gaps
    - 'Feature engineering (growth stage, heat/cold stress hours, intake ratios)'
    - Train/update gradient boosting/TFT models
    - Generate forecasts with prediction intervals
    - Highlight deviation vs. standards and suggest checks
    - Export to dashboards and notify stakeholders
  tools:

    - Temporal Fusion Transformer (PyTorch)
    - Kats/Prophet for baselines
    - Google Sheets/CSV import
    - Power BI/Looker dashboards

    - Early warning list by house with root-cause hints
    - CSV/API feeds to planning systems
  pricingModel:
    - Per-flock fee or monthly subscription per complex
    - Volume discounts by number of houses
  humanInLoop: false
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4.3
    overall: 4.6
  risks:
    - Data quality gaps and inconsistent logging
    - Scale bias if bird scales under-sample
    - Confounding integrator practice changes
  dependencies:
    - Historical data (≥6–12 flocks per house ideal)
    - Standardized logging format
    - Access to scale/controller exports
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned mortality spikes (disease, ventilation, heat stress) are
      detected too late; current visibility relies on daily counts and weekly
      weights, limiting proactive response.
    - >-
      Feed conversion ratio (FCR) drift is recognized post-harvest; nutrition
      and management adjustments are reactive, not predictive.
    - >-
      Harvest and thinning dates are set using rules of thumb; late weight
      attainment or overweight birds drive penalties, overtime, and downgraded
      carcasses.
    - >-
      Live production managers juggle dozens–hundreds of houses; signal is
      buried in noisy data (controllers, water, feed, weather, litter quality)
      across disconnected systems.
    - >-
      Integrators cannot reliably forecast EPEF 1+ weeks out per house/complex,
      hampering bonus programs, contract grower coaching, and processing plant
      scheduling.
    - >-
      Existing tools provide monitoring and BI dashboards but lack accurate 7–14
      day predictions with clear, prescriptive actions at the flock and house
      level.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily model-driven forecasts (7–14 days ahead) for mortality, average
      weight, FCR, and EPEF with confidence bands at house, flock, and complex
      levels.
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations mapped to root causes (e.g., adjust
      ventilation setpoints, lighting schedule, feed phase timing,
      stocking/harvest plan).
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test interventions (e.g., +5% minimum ventilation,
      earlier feed phase change) to see forecast deltas on FCR/weight/mortality.
    - >-
      Automated alerts for early anomaly detection (rising mortality,
      water-to-feed ratio anomalies, suppressed weight gain).
    - >-
      Harvest and feed logistics optimizer: propose thinning/harvest dates and
      feed orders aligned to predicted growth and plant capacity.
    - >-
      API and native connectors to controllers (SKOV, Rotem/Munters, Hotraco),
      farm management software (e.g., MTech), and data lakes for easy
      deployment.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable 7–14 day forecasts of mortality, average weight, FCR, and EPEF at
    house/flock/complex level—paired with prioritized, prescriptive
    interventions—so producers prevent losses, optimize feed and harvest plans,
    and improve profitability with measurable ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, multimodal dataset across diverse complexes and
    geographies paired with validated, prescriptive playbooks and OEM
    integrations. Most competitors either monitor or benchmark; FlockForecast AI
    uniquely delivers accurate 7–14 day forecasts across all four KPIs
    (mortality, weight, FCR, EPEF) with clear, auditable interventions and
    harvest/feed optimization.
