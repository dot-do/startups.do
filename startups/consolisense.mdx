leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Freight overspend from suboptimal mode mix and missed consolidations
      (typical 5–12% above attainable baseline in parcel/LTL-heavy networks).
    - >-
      Static routing guides and TMS rules can’t handle dynamic SLAs, cutoffs,
      dock capacity, or carrier surcharges in real time, causing late shipments
      and avoidable accessorials.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across OMS/WMS/TMS and carrier rate tables delays
      decisioning; manual analysts can’t evaluate all combinations under time
      pressure.
    - >-
      Lack of reliable transit-time and SLA-attainment predictions leads to
      conservative selections (defaulting to parcel/air), increasing
      cost-to-serve.
    - >-
      Missed zone-skip and pool distribution opportunities due to unclear
      consolidation windows or fear of SLA breach.
    - >-
      Inconsistent pack/dim assumptions inflate billable weight and cause mode
      misclassification (parcel vs LTL).
    - >-
      Limited visibility into realized savings vs. plan and no closed-loop
      learning to improve rules/thresholds.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted decisioning engine that recommends consolidations and mode,
      honoring SLAs, carrier cutoffs, dock capacities, packaging constraints,
      and inventory availability.
    - >-
      Predictive ETA/transit model using historical carrier performance,
      distance, service levels, weather/traffic signals, and blackout calendars
      to estimate SLA attainment probabilities.
    - >-
      Dynamic hold-and-release policy optimizer to determine when to hold orders
      for consolidation vs ship now, by risk tolerance and SLA class.
    - >-
      Rate and surcharge normalization: ingest carrier rate cards, accessorial
      rules, DIM factors, fuel and peak surcharges to compute true
      cost-to-serve.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: backtest 8–13 weeks of historical orders to quantify
      savings and SLA impact; supports A/B policies by lane, customer, and node.
    - >-
      Execution adapters into TMS/WMS/OMS (e.g., OTM, SAP TM, Blue Yonder,
      Manhattan, MercuryGate, Descartes, E2open) to publish shipments,
      consolidations, and mode selections.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts for cutoff risk, consolidation window closing, and
      exceptions; explainability panel showing the decision rationale.
    - >-
      Carbon-aware optimization mode that includes CO2e impact in tie-breakers
      and reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce freight cost 5–15% and shipments 10–20% without sacrificing SLAs by
    using an explainable AI/optimization engine that consolidates orders and
    selects the optimal mode (parcel vs LTL vs TL vs intermodal) under real
    cutoffs, capacity, and carrier constraints—deployable in 4–8 weeks with
    measurable ROI in one quarter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, SLA-aware optimization tuned for sub-day cutoffs and
    consolidation windows; prebuilt connectors to major TMS/WMS; proprietary
    rate/contract normalization library and anonymized performance benchmarks
    enabling faster time-to-value and more accurate decisions than generic TMS
    rules or one-off consulting models.

  character: >-
    Operations and logistics leaders at shippers, retailers, and 3PLs who want
    on‑time delivery at the lowest total landed cost without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented orders, tight cutoffs, volatile rates, and siloed SLAs
    cause suboptimal parcel/LTL/TL/intermodal choices.

    Internal: Planners are forced to guess under time pressure and constantly
    firefight exceptions.

    Philosophical: Hitting SLAs shouldn’t require overspending or heroic effort.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the late‑night rebooks, carrier fall‑downs, and
    chargeback emails.

    Process plan:

    1) Connect: Securely link ERP/WMS/TMS orders, rates, and SLA data.

    2) Decide: AI recommends consolidations and optimal mode with cost/OTIF
    trade‑offs and clear rationale.

    3) Execute: Approve or auto‑apply in your TMS; monitor KPIs and iterate.

    Agreement plan:

    - Keep your carriers and SLAs; you control automation thresholds.

    - Enterprise security and data governance.

    - Start with a low‑risk pilot on historical shipments.
