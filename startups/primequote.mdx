  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile input costs (USDA/CME indices, supplier quotes) change daily, but
      most wholesalers update price lists weekly or via ad hoc spreadsheets,
      causing missed margin and lost deals.
    - >-
      Sales reps spend 1–3 hours/day manually assembling quotes across
      cuts/customers, with inconsistent freight, yield, and shrink calculations.
    - >-
      Thin margins (3–8%) are eroded by unaccounted costs (freight, trim/yield
      loss, spoilage, rebates/allowances), leading to price leakage and poor
      price realization.
    - >-
      Customer-specific pricing rules, rebates, and exceptions live in email and
      memory, creating compliance risk and inconsistent customer experiences.
    - >-
      Slow quote turnaround (>24 hours) loses fast-moving opportunities and
      reduces win rates in a commodity-driven market.
    - >-
      Limited forecasting and no automated guardrails expose companies to
      selling below floor margins, especially when markets swing quickly.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (ERP, CRM, spreadsheets, email) make it hard to
      attribute outcomes and continuously improve pricing strategy.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized mapping to IMPS/NAMP codes and inconsistent SKU
      naming leads to poor analytics and mispriced cuts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven price recommendations by customer and cut using historical
      wins/losses, price realization, and market indices (USDA AMS, CME).
    - >-
      Automated yield/trim normalization to IMPS/NAMP codes to compare supplier
      offers apples-to-apples and set accurate base costs.
    - >-
      Freight and accessorial cost modeling by lane, service level, and
      temperature control, with live or benchmark rate inputs.
    - >-
      Dynamic margin guardrails and approvals to prevent sub-floor deals and
      ensure target margin adherence.
    - >-
      One-click quote generation: AI drafts emails and quote PDFs with
      customer-specific terms, pack sizes, and substitutions.
    - >-
      Real-time risk alerts when market indices move beyond thresholds; suggest
      repricing of open quotes and key accounts.
    - >-
      Integrations to ERP (e.g., Epicor P21, NECS entrée, NetSuite, Dynamics),
      CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), and email (O365/Gmail).
    - >-
      Configurable pricing strategies (cost-plus, index-plus, target return,
      customer elasticity-based).
    - >-
      Robust audit trails for every price change and quote (who, when, why) to
      support compliance and coaching.
    - >-
      Embedded ROI dashboard to track margin lift, win-rate changes, and cycle
      time reductions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native pricing and quoting built for meat wholesalers: customer- and
    cut-level price recommendations in minutes that factor indices, yields,
    freight, and target margins—plus automated, compliant quotes and emails that
    increase win rate and lift margin by 50–200 bps.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained pricing engine with IMPS/NAMP mapping and yield
    normalization purpose-built for meat, combined with proprietary datasets of
    win/loss outcomes and price realization by cut and customer. Deep ERP/CRM
    integrations and audit-grade guardrails create switching costs and trust
    that generic CPQ/price tools lack.
