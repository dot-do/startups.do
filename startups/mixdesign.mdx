  problem:
    - >-
      Cement is the largest variable cost in dry-cast masonry units; plants
      over-dose cement to protect against variability, eroding margins.
    - >-
      Aggregate moisture/gradation variability, seasonal changes, and machine
      compaction differences make strength and absorption performance
      unpredictable without continual trial mixes.
    - >-
      Compliance risk with ASTM (e.g., C90, C129, C140, C1262) and CEN/EN (e.g.,
      EN 771-3, EN 772 series) standards leads to costly scrap, rework, or
      rejected lots.
    - >-
      Trial-and-error optimization consumes lab time, materials, and machine
      uptime; new materials (SCMs/admixtures) increase complexity.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in from admixture suppliers’ “free” optimization creates
      conflict of interest and limits cost transparency.
    - >-
      Limited plant-level data science capabilities; existing QC systems log
      results but don’t prescribe cost-optimal, standards-constrained mix
      changes in real time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-in: ingest historical QC (compressive strength, absorption, density),
      material certificates, gradation curves, moisture data, production
      parameters, curing conditions, and unit SKUs.
    - >-
      Calibration: build a plant-specific digital twin linking materials,
      moisture, compaction energy, and curing to strength/absorption; validate
      with 2–3 targeted trial mixes.
    - >-
      Optimization: AI proposes mix proportions (cement, SCMs, aggregates,
      water, admixture) and process setpoints that minimize cost subject to
      ASTM/CEN constraints and customer guardrails.
    - >-
      Pilot runs: controlled A/B production, on-press sampling, and lab
      verification; automated stop-loss guardrails if predicted pass probability
      drops below target.
    - >-
      Deployment: recipe locking, operator guidance, moisture/compaction
      adjustments, and automatic batch setpoint updates via PLC/API integration.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: update models weekly with new QC data, material
      changes, and seasonal adjustments; anomaly detection on moisture and
      gradation shifts.
    - >-
      Reporting: savings dashboard (cement/ton, $/unit), compliance pass
      probability, CO2 reduction estimate, and audit-ready documentation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut cement cost 5–15% while maintaining 99%+ lot pass rate to
    ASTM/CEN—deployed in under 30 days without changing equipment.
