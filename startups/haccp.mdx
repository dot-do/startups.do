leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Paper/electronic CCP logs and sensor data are siloed, making it hard to
      detect deviations in real time; missed checks are often discovered during
      audits or after product holds.
    - >-
      Manual CAPA creation is slow and inconsistent; root causes are repeated
      and preventive actions are weak or undocumented.
    - >-
      Audit preparation is time-consuming (days to weeks), requiring evidence
      collection across logs, sensors, training records, and maintenance
      systems.
    - >-
      FSMA/GFSI expectations for verification, validation, and documented
      evidence are rising; plants struggle to sustain compliance across shifts
      and product SKUs.
    - >-
      Existing solutions digitize checklists but rarely correlate multi-source
      data (sensor streams, batch records, sanitation logs) to predict and
      prevent issues.
    - >-
      Skilled FSQA labor is tight; supervisors spend too much time on clerical
      tasks instead of proactive risk reduction.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: ingest CCP checklists (paper via OCR/mobile and
      digital forms), IoT/SCADA sensor streams (temp, pH, metal detection,
      time–temperature), batch/lot and production schedules,
      sanitation/maintenance records.
    - >-
      Real-time deviation and missed-check detection: threshold, rule-based, and
      anomaly models that flag out-of-spec CCPs, trend drift, and overdue
      checks; risk scoring and escalation workflows.
    - >-
      AI-driven CAPA assistant: guided 5-Whys and fishbone, suggested root
      causes based on historical outcomes and context (equipment, shift,
      product), recommended corrective/preventive actions, and verification
      plans.
    - >-
      Audit-ready documentation: auto-compiled evidence packs mapped to HACCP
      plan, FSMA, and GFSI clauses; immutable audit trails and e-signature
      controls with role-based access.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement analytics: Pareto of deviations, CAPA effectiveness
      tracking, micro-trend detection (e.g., cooling curve violations by
      product/line/shift), and ROI dashboards.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors for major ERP/MES/QMS/CMMS/LIMS and common sensor
      gateways; bi-directional triggers (e.g., open a maintenance work order
      when metal detector fails).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time HACCP watchdog and AI CAPA co-pilot that unifies CCP records and
    sensor data, detects deviations and missed checks early, auto-drafts CAPAs
    with root-cause guidance, and generates audit-ready evidence packs—reducing
    holds, rework, and audit prep time by 50–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking CCP deviations to sensor patterns and
    CAPA outcomes across perishable categories, combined with prevalidated
    HACCP/CAPA templates and deep integrations to plant-floor systems—enabling
    faster, more accurate detection and CAPA guidance than generic QMS or
    digital form tools.
