  problem:
    - >-
      Chemical dosing for retention aids, sizing (AKD/ASA), starch, and defoamer
      is managed by trial-and-error across shifts, causing high variability and
      overspend.
    - >-
      Interactions across additives are complex and non-linear; optimizing one
      (e.g., defoamer) can degrade others (e.g., sizing efficiency), leading to
      quality excursions (e.g., Cobb60 failures) and broke.
    - >-
      Mills lack a systematic, data-driven method to select dose setpoints for
      changing furnish, ash, temperature, and speed conditions; existing
      rules-of-thumb drift with raw material variability.
    - >-
      On-site expertise isn’t available 24/7; vendor programs are siloed and may
      bias toward higher consumption rather than total cost minimization.
    - >-
      Unstructured trials waste time and tons; poor DOE design yields
      inconclusive results and risk to production.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of true chemical cost/ton and impact on FPR, drainage,
      steam/ton, breaks, and lab properties delays corrective action.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a data-driven optimization engine that ingests live process signals
      (furnish, consistency, flow, pH, conductivity, temperature, speed,
      headbox, vacuum, white water turbidity), QCS (basis weight, moisture,
      ash), and lab results (Cobb60, tensile, burst, porosity) to recommend
      additive dose setpoints by grade and condition.
    - >-
      Model interactions across retention aid, sizing, starch, and defoamer
      using hybrid ML (Bayesian optimization + constraints + physics-informed
      features) to minimize chemical $/ton subject to quality and runnability
      constraints.
    - >-
      Generate safe, statistically powered trial plans (DOE) for step tests and
      A/B trials with predicted impact, guardrails, and automated KPIs, reducing
      trial time by 30–50%.
    - >-
      Provide operator-facing advisor: clear setpoint recommendations, reasons,
      expected savings, and quality risk; one-click apply to DCS (advisory mode
      → optional closed-loop).
    - >-
      Automated verification: calculate savings baseline, quality conformance
      rate, and report by shift/grade; alerts for drift, overuse, or risk of
      quality failure.
    - >-
      Integration toolkit for PI/OPC-UA/MQTT/QCS/LIMS; shadow-mode validation
      before going live to build trust and quantify impact.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vendor-agnostic AI that recommends safe, real-time dose setpoints and
    structured trial plans to hit quality targets at the lowest total chemical
    cost—typically reducing spend 8–15% while stabilizing FPR and
    Cobb/tensile—deployed in under 6 weeks with measurable ROI and
    performance-based pricing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic optimizer with a growing cross-mill interaction dataset and
    standardized DOE methods that quantify multi-chemical trade-offs;
    performance-based pricing aligns incentives, while integrations and
    guardrails enable rapid, low-risk deployment and trust across shifts.
    Partnerships with chem suppliers/OEMs accelerate access and defensibility.

    Paper mill production managers and process engineers who must hit strength,
    retention, sizing, and runnability targets while lowering chemical cost per
    ton.
  problem: >-
    Process variability, shifting furnish, and vendor‑biased trialing make
    dosing for retention, sizing, starch, and defoamer a guessing game—causing
    overspend, defects, broke, and lost uptime. It shouldn’t take weeks of
    trials to find the right setpoints.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill variability and complex chemistry. Our vendor‑agnostic
    AI, trained on your DCS/QCS/LIMS history, delivers transparent, safe, and
    cost‑optimal dosing recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and targets: integrate DCS/QCS/LIMS, define specs,
    constraints, and costs; 2) Calibrate and simulate: validate models on
    historical runs and set guardrails; 3) Optimize and execute: receive dose
    setpoints and a stepwise trial plan, monitor results, and lock in savings.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 4‑week pilot to see savings on your machine; or request a sample
    trial plan with an ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Hit quality specs at the lowest chemical cost, with fewer upsets and breaks,
    faster trials, improved OEE, and auditable savings with reduced
    effluent/COD.
  failure: >-
    Continue over‑dosing and paying for ineffective chemistry, dragging through
    long vendor‑led trials, risking spec failures, broke, and avoidable
    downtime.
