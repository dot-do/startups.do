  problem:
    - >-
      Store associates spend 3–7 minutes per customer creating monogram mockups
      on phones/Photoshop, slowing queues and hurting conversion.
    - >-
      High rework and scrap (1–5%) from incorrect placement, wrong foil color,
      character spacing, or diacritics not supported.
    - >-
      Inconsistent SOPs across stores and operators; lack of SKU-specific
      templates leads to human error.
    - >-
      Customers can’t visualize foil color, scale, and placement accurately on
      textured leather, creating post-purchase dissatisfaction and chargebacks.
    - >-
      No audit trail/approval capture for personalized goods, leading to
      disputes and returns.
    - >-
      Manual production tickets are incomplete (missing heat/pressure/time,
      placement offsets), causing delays and operator guesswork.
    - >-
      Omnichannel gaps: online proofs don’t map to in-store/warehouse production
      settings, causing mismatches.
  solution:
    - >-
      Visual proof engine renders initials, symbols, and diacritics on product
      photos in under 1 second with realistic foil/emboss simulation and
      texture-aware shading.
    - >-
      Template library per SKU defines allowed monogram zones, baselines,
      kerning, max characters, and color availability; enforced by rules to
      prevent invalid configurations.
    - >-
      One-click production ticket includes: SKU, placement coordinates (mm),
      offsets, foil color, stamp die code, heat/pressure/time, and operator
      notes; generated as QR code/PDF.
    - >-
      Customer approval capture (e-sign on device or remote link), stored with
      order ID; reduces disputes/returns.
    - >-
      Integrations with POS/ecom (Shopify, Lightspeed, Salesforce Commerce) to
      add personalization line items and sync order status.
    - >-
      Operator app scans QR to load machine settings and visualize final
      placement overlay; supports batch mode for warehouse/3PL.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard tracks conversion, time-to-proof, rework rate, and
      attach rate uplifts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, SKU-accurate monogram previews that auto-generate production
    tickets (exact placement, foil color, and machine settings) to cut rework
    below 1%, speed transactions by 2–4 minutes, and unify proof-to-production
    across stores and channels.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing SKU-specific placement and settings dataset linked to real
    production outcomes, plus equipment preset libraries and a closed-loop
    quality system that rivals can’t easily replicate. Combined with
    high-fidelity foil/emboss simulation tuned for leather textures, it delivers
    first-time-right accuracy beyond generic product customizers.
