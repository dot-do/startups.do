leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High seasonality drives stockouts and missed revenue (e.g.,
      prom/Halloween/wedding peaks cause 20–40% stockouts in core sizes like
      38–42R jackets, 32–34W trousers).
    - >-
      Inventory sits idle off-peak; utilization varies by 2–3x between locations
      due to poor size/location allocation.
    - >-
      Repairs/alterations backlog ties up 5–15% of rentable inventory during
      peak weeks, but shops lack ROI-based repair prioritization.
    - >-
      Purchase decisions are reactive and size-blind, leading to overbuying
      low-demand sizes and underbuying high-demand sizes.
    - >-
      Pricing is static or ad hoc, missing weekday/lead-time sensitivity and
      competitor signals; margin left on the table during high demand and
      discounts too deep off-peak.
    - >-
      Shops rely on spreadsheets and manual intuition; no weekly, size-level
      forecast tied to actionable POs, repair work orders, or pricing changes.
    - >-
      Lack of external signals (school calendars, local events, weather) causes
      forecast drift during regional events.
    - >-
      Multi-location chains struggle to coordinate sharing/transfer of sizes to
      match local demand.
    - >-
      Limited analytics resources; integrating POS, bookings, and repair data is
      time-consuming and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest POS, booking, and inventory data; auto-map SKUs to category/size;
      enrich with local school calendars, wedding seasonality, events, and
      weather.
    - >-
      Generate weekly forecasts per location by category/size (e.g., tux jacket
      40R, cummerbund black M) with confidence intervals and days-of-supply.
    - >-
      Recommend buy/repair/transfer: prioritize repairs by expected profit lift
      and lead time; flag retiring SKUs; propose size-corrected POs and
      inter-store transfers.
    - >-
      Pricing nudges: elasticity-aware price adjustments by weekday/lead-time
      and inventory pressure, with guardrails for brand/competitor constraints.
    - >-
      Create executable workflows: push POs to purchasing, repair work orders to
      tailors/cleaners, and price updates to POS/online booking.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate event spikes (prom dates, premieres) and
      what-if pricing or procurement changes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: measure forecast error, conversion, stockouts, and
      realized ROI; automatically retrain models weekly.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weekly, size- and category-level forecasts with automated procurement,
    repair prioritization, and pricing nudges that lift revenue 5–10%, reduce
    stockouts 30–50%, and cut idle inventory 10–20% within 90 days—using the
    data you already have in your POS/booking systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertical, size-aware demand and repair/pricing dataset built from
    aggregated, anonymized rental transactions, appointment calendars, and
    regional event/school data—paired with closed-loop integrations that turn
    forecasts into executed POs, repair orders, transfers, and price changes.
    Network effects improve accuracy and uplift per new tenant; seasonality maps
    (prom/wedding/Halloween) by ZIP and size curve benchmarks are difficult to
    replicate.

    Owners and operations leaders of formal wear and costume rental businesses
    who need the right sizes and styles available each week, healthy garments on
    the rack, and reliable margins.
  problem: >-
    External: Demand swings by event/season/size, damaged items bottleneck
    availability, manual spreadsheets lead to over/understock and pricing
    guesswork. Internal: Stress from stockouts, rush fixes, tied-up cash, and
    low confidence in buying/repair decisions. Philosophical: Rentals should
    delight customers—not gamble on inventory—and every garment deserves a
    planned lifecycle.
  guide: >-
    We understand the Friday size crunch, prom/wedding spikes, and repair
    backlogs. Built by supply-chain data scientists with rental ops experience,
    our AI turns your POS, reservations, and repair logs into clear weekly
    actions—so you can plan, not react.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect systems (POS/reservations/inventory/repair logs). 2) Get
    weekly category/size forecasts with procurement, repair priorities, and
    pricing nudges. 3) Act via one-click POs/work orders and track KPIs as the
    model learns. Agreement: Start with a 4-week pilot, transparent metrics,
    secure data, no long-term contract.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 4‑week pilot. Transitional:
    Download a sample weekly forecast and ROI calculator; subscribe to the
    demand insights newsletter.
  success: >-
    Fewer stockouts and rushed fixes, higher utilization, smarter buys, timely
    repairs, healthier margins, happier customers, and calm, predictable weeks.
  failure: >-
    Missed bookings, size gaps, idle or overbought inventory, repair backlogs,
    last‑minute chaos, squeezed margins, and poor reviews.
