  problem:
    - >-
      Nonferrous (Ni/Ti/Mg/Zn/refractory) extrusion/drawing/rolling shops rely
      on tribal knowledge and static runbooks, causing inconsistent start-up
      conditions and extended trial-and-error on new alloys/profiles.
    - >-
      High scrap/rework (often 5–15% on high-value Ni/Ti and refractory runs)
      due to poor initial setpoints for billet/furnace temp, ram speed,
      reduction schedule, and lubricant selection.
    - >-
      Long setup and qualification cycles (3–10 trials to hit spec for new
      profiles or heat lots), tying up presses/mills and delaying deliveries.
    - >-
      Insufficient capture of context (heat chemistry, billet lot history, die
      wear state, ambient conditions), making learnings non-transferable and
      limiting continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Existing tools (finite element simulators, generic analytics) are offline,
      slow, or require specialized expertise, and do not give on-press, safe,
      and explainable starting setpoints.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across MES/PLC/historian/LIMS/quality systems;
      integration and cleaning are major barriers to AI adoption in harsh plant
      environments.
    - >-
      Risk aversion in critical applications (aerospace, medical, energy)
      requires guardrails and traceability that most AI tools do not provide.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data connectors unify historical run data (MES/ERP orders, PLC/SCADA tags,
      historian time series, LIMS chemistry, quality/NDT results, die ledger,
      ambient data).
    - >-
      Feature engineering per run: alloy family and precise chemistry, billet
      history (cast/forge/soak), die ID and wear cycles, extrusion ratio, prior
      pass reductions, lube type/condition, container/die/billet temps,
      speed/ram pressure traces, backpressure, breakdown/load events.
    - >-
      Alloy-profile recommender: proposes initial billet/furnace temperatures,
      container/die temps, ram speed curve, reduction schedule, and lubricant
      selection with uncertainty bounds and rationale.
    - >-
      Physics- and standards-informed guardrails: metallurgical constraints
      (e.g., beta-transus/two-phase windows for Ti, incipient melt margins for
      Ni, Mg oxidation risk windows) to prevent unsafe suggestions.
    - >-
      What-if and scenario planning: simulate expected quality risks (surface
      defects, dimensional variance, microstructure proxies) vs. setpoint
      changes before committing.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture operator overrides, actual outcomes, and NDT
      results to continuously update models; per-shift performance feedback.
    - >-
      On-press/MES UI: minimal-click recommendation acceptance with
      traceability; export setpoints to PLC where allowed; generate electronic
      run cards.
    - >-
      Explainability and audit: reason codes, influential factors, and
      compliance-ready logs for AS9100/ISO 9001 audits.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem or hybrid; ITAR/EAR-ready data isolation;
      SSO/AD integration; API/OPC UA connectors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that learns from your historical runs to recommend safe, explainable
    starting setpoints by alloy/profile — cutting scrap 15–30%, reducing
    trials-to-spec by 50%, and shortening setups 25–40% within 90 days, with
    on-prem options and metallurgical guardrails for critical applications.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Physics-informed, alloy-specific constraint engine combined with explainable
    recommender models built from real plant data, delivered on-prem with
    OEM/lube partnerships. Team combines AI, metallurgical expertise, and

  character: >-
    Process engineers, metallurgists, and production leaders at nonferrous
    (except copper and aluminum) rolling, drawing, and extrusion mills who need
    the right starting parameters by alloy/profile to hit throughput, quality,
    and delivery without endless trials.
  problem: >-
    - External: Choosing billet/furnace temps, ram or line speed, reduction
    schedule, and lubricant for new alloys/profiles is slow and risky—leading to
    scrap, breakages, die wear, and missed deliveries; tribal knowledge is
    scattered.

    - Internal: Teams feel pressure and uncertainty; onboarding new operators is
    hard; nights/weekends firefighting.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess and waste metal to learn what
    your own plant already knows.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the chaos of first-article runs, die changes, and
    alloy variability across Mg, Ti, Ni, Zn, Pb/Sn, and specialty alloys.

    - Authority: An AI recommender trained on your historical runs, QC results,
    and die history; outputs validated, constraint-aware suggestions with
    confidence; secure on-prem or cloud; proven to reduce trials and stabilize
    quality.
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Connect press/line logs, furnace data, QC/lab results, and die/tooling metadata.
      2) Train by alloy, profile, and die to suggest starting setpoints (billet/furnace temp, ram/line speed, pass/reduction schedule, lubricant) with guardrails.
      3) Pilot on one line and a few alloys; capture operator feedback after each run to improve.
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Your data stays yours; security reviewed; human-in-the-loop approvals.
      - Start small: 4-week pilot, no PLC changes required.
      - Clear QA sign-off and rollback path.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30‑minute discovery to scope a pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the data-mapping checklist, ROI calculator, and
    sample run-log schema.
  success: >-
    - First-article runs start closer to right; fewer trials, less scrap, and
    fewer die incidents.

    - Faster setups, higher throughput, steadier properties/surface, longer die
    life, lower energy per tonne.

    - Captured tribal knowledge, faster onboarding, predictable deliveries, and
    happier customers.
  failure: >-
    - Keep guessing setpoints, leading to breakages, rework, erratic properties,
    overtime, and missed orders.

    - Knowledge walks out with retirements; tooling and energy costs climb;
    customer trust erodes.
