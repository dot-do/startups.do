  problem:
    - >-
      Culling is a major time sink: a 5,000–10,000-frame commercial shoot
      typically costs 2–6 hours to review manually in Photo
      Mechanic/Lightroom/Capture One, delaying selects and client approvals.
    - >-
      Near-duplicates and burst sequences make human judgment inconsistent;
      different editors choose different frames, causing rework and client
      confusion.
    - >-
      Soft/out-of-focus or motion-blurred frames slip through to delivery,
      eroding trust and increasing retouching costs.
    - >-
      Producing client-ready contact sheets is tedious (15–30 minutes per
      look/scene, often 2–8 hours per job) and inconsistent across teams/brands.
    - >-
      Teams lack objective quality scoring (sharpness, eyes open, moiré,
      banding, motion blur) and have no easy way to learn client-specific style
      preferences for future shoots.
    - >-
      Commercial workflows need shot-list compliance, metadata alignment
      (SKU/UPC/Look), and XMP rating exports—most AI culling tools don’t address
      these enterprise requirements.
    - >-
      Security and privacy are critical for unreleased products/campaigns; many
      teams can’t upload RAWs to generic clouds, limiting AI adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven culling pipeline: perceptual hashing + temporal grouping for
      bursts; quality scoring for sharpness, subject eyes-open, motion blur,
      moiré, exposure, and composition; then rank top candidates per group.
    - >-
      De-duplication and near-duplicate collapsing using multi-scale perceptual
      hashing with thresholds tuned to common bracketing, focus stacks, and
      micro-poses (target 95%+ F1 on near-duplicate detection).
    - >-
      Objective quality scoring trained on commercial datasets (faces, products,
      textiles) with per-domain weights (e.g., prioritize moiré detection for
      apparel, edge sharpness for product).
    - >-
      Select proposals: top-N per burst/angle with configurable criteria (e.g.,
      1–3 per look/SKU), exportable as XMP ratings/labels to Lightroom/Capture
      One, and as CSV metadata for studio systems.
    - >-
      Automated, brandable contact sheets (PDF/Web) organized by
      look/scene/SKU/shot-list step, with watermarks and shareable links for
      review/approval. Turnaround target: 5,000 frames to contact sheet in <10
      minutes on M2 Max/local GPU or <8 minutes cloud.
    - >-
      Privacy-first architecture: local desktop inference (Apple Silicon/NVIDIA)
      and/or on-prem VM; cloud option stores only lightweight proxies and purges
      RAWs post-inference under configurable retention policies.
    - >-
      Shot-list compliance: ingest CSV/Google Sheet shot lists, auto-tag frames
      via barcode/QR/tethered metadata, highlight missing/extra shots in
      deliverables.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut culling and contact-sheet delivery from hours to minutes with AI tuned
    for commercial workflows. SelectIQ ingests RAW/JPEGs, auto-groups bursts,
    de-duplicates, flags soft/blurred frames, objectively scores image quality,
    and proposes selects. It exports XMP ratings/labels, builds branded contact
    sheets automatically, and maps to shot lists/SKUs—privacy-first with
    local/on-prem options.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Commercial-grade dataset and models tuned for product/fashion/editorial use
    cases; workflow DNA (shot-list/SKU mapping, enterprise security) that
    generic culling apps lack; hybrid local/on-prem inference for
    privacy-sensitive shoots; and adaptive style models that learn per-client
    preferences, increasing acceptance over time.

  character: >-
    Commercial photographers, producers, and studio managers who need fast,
    objective image selects.
  problem: >-
    You shoot thousands under tight deadlines; culling is slow, subjective, and
    error-prone—near-duplicates, soft frames, and bursts bury the hero shots.
  guide: >-
    We get high-stakes shoots. Our AI, trained on pro workflows, de-duplicates,
    flags soft/out-of-focus frames, groups bursts, scores quality, and proposes
    selects with clean contact sheets.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest RAW/JPEG. 2) AI de-dupes, focus-checks, groups bursts, and scores
    quality. 3) Review proposed selects and auto contact sheets; export to
    client or DAM.
  callToAction: Start a free trial or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Minutes to first selects, consistent quality, airtight contact sheets,
    faster client approvals, fewer reshoots, and more billable creative time.
  failure: >-
    Avoid lost hours, missed focus, late deliveries, bloated archives, and
    subjective, second‑guessed selects.

    - Review cycles drag on and delay delivery.
  solution:
    - One place to ingest RAW/JPEGs and auto-organize a shoot.
    - 'AI quality scoring surfaces the sharpest, cleanest frames first.'
    - Near-duplicate removal and burst grouping cut clutter fast.
