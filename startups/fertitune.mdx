leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Growers lack closed-loop, data-driven irrigation-fertigation optimization
      across both recirculating and drain-to-waste systems, leading to
      inconsistent EC-pH control and suboptimal drain fractions
    - >-
      Input waste is high: over-irrigation and conservative EC targets often
      create 10 to 30 percent excess drain, fertilizer overuse, and higher
      discharge fees
    - >-
      Recipe decisions are largely manual and reactive, relying on limited slab
      or drain sampling and single-point sensors versus continuous, multi-sensor
      feedback
    - >-
      Existing climate computers and fertigation units offer rules and alarms
      but little autonomous optimization grounded in crop models and
      drain-substrate dynamics
    - >-
      Regulatory and retailer pressure to reduce water use and nutrient
      discharge is increasing, yet growers lack auditable metrics and tools to
      prove reductions
    - >-
      Integrations are fragmented across sensors, climate computers, and dosing
      systems, creating data silos and underutilized investments
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to existing sensors and controls via secure API or gateway – slab
      moisture and temperature, drain EC-pH and flow, irrigation volume,
      radiation, climate computer states, fertigation mixer status
    - >-
      Learn a site-specific substrate-drain-crop response model using 2 to 4
      weeks of data, seeded by crop-stage and substrate type priors
    - >-
      Recommend and optionally auto-apply irrigation start-stop thresholds based
      on solar integral and VPD, pulse spacing, and drain fraction targets by
      time of day and radiation level
    - >-
      Continuously adapt feed EC-pH targets by crop stage and light level while
      constraining recirculation reuse based on return EC-pH and pathogen-risk
      proxies such as temperature and turbidity (if available)
    - >-
      Balance recirculating loops by optimizing blend ratios fresh feed versus
      return to maintain crop-available ions and reduce disposal volumes within
      permit limits
    - >-
      Guardrail control with safe bounds and human-in-the-loop approval – revert
      to baseline strategy if anomalies occur, with root-cause diagnostics and
      audit trails
    - >-
      Dashboards, alerts, and weekly agronomy reports – yield and quality
      proxies, drain variance, EC stability, nutrient-use intensity, water
      productivity, plus savings vs baseline
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Closed-loop AI that optimizes irrigation timing, volume, and EC-pH setpoints
    using substrate and drain data to lift yield 1 to 3 percent while cutting
    water 10 to 20 percent and fertilizer 8 to 15 percent in under 90 days, with
    vendor-agnostic integrations and guardrails that protect crops.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary cross-vendor dataset of substrate-drain dynamics and outcomes
    across crops and seasons, combined with validated closed-loop control
    algorithms with crop-safe guardrails and OEM write integrations that are
    costly and time-consuming for new entrants to replicate.

  character: >-
    Commercial greenhouse and indoor growers (NAICS 111419) who want consistent
    yields, lower input costs, and less waste from recirculating or
    drain‑to‑waste systems.
  problem: >-
    - External: Irrigation and fertigation drift with weather, crop stage, and
    substrate; EC/pH and moisture swing; recirculating loops complicate balance;
    drain‑to‑waste burns water and nutrients; discharge compliance pressure.

    - Internal: Teams are tired of guesswork, spreadsheets, and chasing drain
    targets across zones and days.

    - Philosophical: Growing food under cover shouldn’t require wasting inputs
    to achieve quality.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve run substrate grows and know the pain of chasing stable
    rootzone EC, pH, and moisture.

    - Authority: Horticulture + data science team; proven across coco, rockwool,
    perlite; integrates with Priva, Hoogendoorn, Argus, Netafim, Grodan/Bluelab;
    field‑validated savings and yield gains.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest substrate/drain sensors, EC/pH, flow meters, and climate
    computer data; note crop goals and constraints (recirc or D2W).

    2) Tune: Baseline audit, then AI‑generated timing, shot size, and nutrient
    EC/pH targets by zone/time‑of‑day; simulate runoff/recovery; compliance
    check.

    3) Execute: Push schedules or setpoints, monitor drift, auto‑adjust daily;
    weekly agronomist review.

    - Low risk: 30‑day pilot; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot to tune one crop zone this cycle.
    - Transitional: Get a free drain variability and EC/pH drift report.
  success: |-
    - Stable rootzone EC/pH and moisture across zones and days
    - 10–25% water savings, 15–30% fertilizer savings, 30–60% less runoff
    - +3–8% yield and tighter grade specs; fewer stress events
    - Lower labor, simpler audits, and easier discharge compliance
  failure: >-
    Avoid over/underwatering, EC/pH drift, nutrient lockout, root disease,
    wasted inputs, discharge penalties, constant manual tweaking, and
    inconsistent yields.
