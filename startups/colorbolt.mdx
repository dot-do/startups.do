  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers spend 10–30 hours/week manually cleaning backgrounds and
      color-correcting product photos for fabrics, threads, trims, and notions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent color accuracy (lighting, cameras, no ICC workflows) leads to
      returns and customer complaints; DeltaE errors > 4 are common for
      reds/blues and textured fabrics.
    - >-
      Publishing new arrivals is slow (1–2 weeks backlog), missing sales windows
      for seasonal collections and pre-orders.
    - >-
      Creating and maintaining colorway variants and styled visualizations is
      labor-intensive and often skipped, reducing conversion for multi-color
      SKUs.
    - >-
      Small teams lack in-house expertise or budget for pro studios; outsourcing
      is costly ($0.50–$2.00/image) and slow (24–72 hrs).
    - >-
      Marketplace and web standards (Shopify/Etsy/Google) require uniform image
      specs; non-compliant images reduce discoverability and ad quality scores.
  solution:
    - >-
      Vertical-trained AI pipeline: background removal optimized for fabrics,
      trims, and translucent notions with crisp edges and preserved textures.
    - >-
      Color-managed workflow: ICC-aware correction using gray card/swatch
      references; target DeltaE < 2.5 on calibrated inputs.
    - >-
      Colorway generator: creates realistic variants and styled renders (bolts,
      fat quarters, folded stacks, draped scenes, notion packs) from one master
      image or swatch.
    - >-
      Batch & API tools: bulk upload, SKU mapping, versioning, and CDN delivery
      to Shopify/WooCommerce; export packs for marketplaces (Etsy, Google,
      Amazon).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option for high-value SKUs; auto-flag anomalies
      (moiré, color clipping, shadows).
    - >-
      Automated spec compliance: output presets for white/background, aspect
      ratios, padding, DPI, and naming conventions; auto alt-text generation
      with fabric attributes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, consistent, and fast product visuals for the sewing and piece
    goods vertical—background cleanup, true-to-color correction, and automatic
    colorway renders tailored to fabric/textile workflows, delivered in minutes,
    not days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific color-managed pipeline and datasets focused on fabrics,
    prints, and notions—achieving lower DeltaE and better edge preservation than
    generic tools—plus deep integrations (Rain POS, Shopify) and a library of
    retail-ready style templates built with industry partners.
  customerSegments:

      consistent dealer assets.
    - >-
