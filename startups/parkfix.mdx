  problem:
    - >-
      Guest and staff maintenance reports arrive via radios, phone, email, PMS
      notes, or sticky notes, leading to lost, duplicated, or delayed tickets
      (typical time-to-assignment 15–30 minutes).
    - >-
      Critical issues (power pedestal, water, sewer, bathhouse) are not
      prioritized; downtime causes lost revenue (out-of-service sites/amenities)
      and negative reviews with no SLA visibility.
    - >-
      High seasonal turnover and limited training produce inconsistent fixes;
      lack of checklists leads to repeat visits and safety risks.
    - >-
      Parts/tools are not prepped; no inventory link causes delays and extra
      truck rolls; common parts aren’t suggested proactively.
    - >-
      No single source of truth: limited analytics (MTTA, MTTR, first-time-fix),
      no forecasting, poor audit trails for insurance or brand compliance.
    - >-
      Guest communication gaps (no status updates or ETAs) fuel dissatisfaction
      and review risk.
    - >-
      Multi-property operators lack standardized SOPs and cross-park
      benchmarking; franchise HQs can’t enforce brand standards.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omni-channel intake: SMS, voice, QR codes at assets, email, web form, and
      PMS integration; auto-capture photos/video and location.
    - >-
      AI triage and prioritization: classify issue type/severity, deduplicate
      similar reports, estimate revenue/guest impact, and set SLA timers (e.g.,
      P1 power: 2h).
    - >-
      Auto-generated work orders: park-specific SOP checklists with safety
      steps, required skills, and estimated time; multilingual (EN/ES).
    - >-
      Parts and tools suggestions: map checklist to commonly needed parts, check
      on-hand inventory, reserve items, trigger reorders or vendor links.
    - >-
      Smart dispatch: assign by skill, certifications, workload, and shift;
      route optimization across a large property; auto-escalation if SLA risked.
    - >-
      Guest/staff updates: automated acknowledgments, ETAs, and completion
      messages with feedback requests; two-way messaging thread per ticket.
    - >-
      Mobile tech app (offline-capable): step-by-step checklists, photo capture,
      voice notes, barcodes/QR scan for parts, signatures, and time tracking.
    - >-
      SLA and compliance dashboards: live heatmap of P1/P2 breaches, MTTA/MTTR
      trends, brand compliance roll-ups for multi-property ops.
    - >-
      Analytics and forecasting: backlog aging, first-time-fix, cost per ticket,
      seasonal demand, and preventive maintenance recommendations.
    - >-
      Admin tools: SOP library editor, asset registry, role-based permissions,
      training mode for seasonal hires, and integration manager.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any guest or staff report into a prioritized, SOP-driven work order
    with parts suggestions and SLA tracking in under 30 seconds—cutting
    time-to-acknowledge by up to 80% and reducing MTTR 25–40% while protecting
    revenue from out-of-service sites and amenities.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained triage model and SOP library specific to RV
    parks/campgrounds, coupled with deep PMS integrations and brand partnerships
