leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier delivery performance (OTD) volatility causes line stops and
      expedite costs; typical OTD < 95% across long-tail suppliers and lead-time
      variability > 20% month-over-month.
    - >-
      Quality drift is detected late; parts-per-million (PPM) defects spike
      above 500–1,000 without early warning, increasing scrap/rework and
      warranty risk.
    - >-
      Cost increases are negotiated reactively; price paid variance (PPV) vs
      commodity indices exceeds ±5–8%, leaving 2–5% savings uncaptured.
    - >-
      Single/sole sourcing risk: 25–40% of BOM line items have one qualified
      supplier; alternates are not visible at part-attribute level.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/MES/PLM/QMS and spreadsheets prevents proactive
      risk detection; supplier risk tiers are static and not linked to parts or
      spend.
    - >-
      Supplier events (bankruptcy, sanctions, labor strikes, weather, logistics
      disruptions) are manually monitored, leading to slow response (MTTR > 2
      weeks).
    - >-
      Negotiation preparation is inconsistent; buyers spend >5 hours per
      supplier to compile should-costs, demand outlook, and performance
      scorecards.
    - >-
      Lack of part-to-supplier mapping at tier-2/3 results in blind spots; no
      quantified “inventory at risk” or revenue-at-risk view by supplier and
      site.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to ERP/MRP, PLM, QMS, and shipping data to create a normalized
      supplier–part–plant graph with spend, performance, and quality history.
    - >-
      Continuously score supplier risk at part and site level (delivery,
      quality, financial, geo, ESG, compliance) with explainable drivers and
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Detect early-warning signals (OTD trend breaks, PPM spikes, credit
      downgrades, port congestion, weather alerts) and quantify
      inventory/revenue at risk by week and plant.
    - >-
      Recommend alternates: part-attribute matching against internal qualified
      supplier lists, approved manufacturer lists (AML), and external catalogs;
      suggest dual-sourcing plans with impact on PPV, lead time, and PPM.
    - >-
      Generate negotiation briefs per supplier: should-cost benchmarks,
      commodity index deltas, volume leverage, demand outlook, performance
      scorecards, and target price corridors.
    - >-
      Provide scenario playbooks: rebalance volumes, pull-in orders, safety
      stock adjustments, or route changes; simulate cost/risk outcomes.
    - >-
      Workflow and integrations: push alerts and briefs into ERP/S2P (SAP Ariba,
      Coupa, Ivalua, Jaggaer), Slack/Teams, and ticketing for mitigation
      actions.
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: SOC 2/ISO 27001; optional ITAR/GxP controls and
      data residency, audit trails for all suggestions and decisions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary supplier–part graph enriched with anonymized,
    privacy-preserving cross-customer risk signals and commodity dynamics—paired

  character: >-
    Hardware manufacturers (COO, VP Supply Chain, Sourcing, Plant Ops) who must
    keep lines running and margins intact across volatile, multi-tier suppliers.
  problem: >-
    External: late deliveries, quality escapes, price swings, single-source
    exposure. Internal: constant firefighting and spreadsheet blind spots that
    weaken negotiations. Philosophical: you shouldn’t be surprised by
    suppliers—data should warn you early and guide action.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of OTIF, PPAP, and cost targets with limited
    visibility. Our AI continuously monitors supplier delivery/quality/price,
    flags risks, suggests alternates, and prepares negotiation briefs—turning
    your data into an always-on supplier analyst.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: securely link ERP/MRP, MES, QA, and SRM; ingest PO, ASN, NCR,
    and cost data. 2) Configure: set policies, risk thresholds, approved
    alternates, and savings levers. 3) Act: go live with daily risk watchlists,
    alternate recommendations, and auto-generated negotiation briefs; review
    wins in weekly ops.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30-minute Supplier Risk Audit. Transitional: request a
    sample risk snapshot and negotiation brief.
  success: >-
    Proactive risk control, fewer line stops and expedites, stronger supplier
    leverage, faster sourcing cycles, lower COGS, and confident executive
    reviews backed by clear analytics.
  failure: >-
    More surprises, premium freight and downtime, missed commits, margin
    erosion, audit findings, and stalled launches.
