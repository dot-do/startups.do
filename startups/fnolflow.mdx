  title: FNOL intake and triage automation
  description: >-
    Capture first notice of loss from email, portal, or voice; extract key data;
    validate coverage; triage severity; and set up the claim with
    tasks/assignment.
  targetUsers:
    - TPAs
    - Carriers
    - MGAs
    - Claims operations
  triggers:
    - New FNOL email/portal submission
    - Inbound call/voicemail
    - Broker upload
  inputs:
    - 'Emails and attachments (PDF, images)'
    - Web form entries

    - Score/triage severity and detect potential fraud indicators
    - Create claim in core system and assign handler/queue
    - Generate acknowledgement and task checklist

    - Email API (Microsoft Graph/Gmail)
    - 'ASR (e.g., Azure/Google)'
    - 'OCR (e.g., Document AI/Form Recognizer)'
    - LLM extraction and rules engine

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual FNOL intake is slow and costly: 10–20 minutes per claim across
      email/portal/voice, driving $8–$18 labor cost per FNOL and SLA breaches
      during volume spikes.
    - >-
      Data quality issues: 15–25% of FNOLs arrive with missing/incorrect fields
      (policy number, location, loss time), causing rework, duplicates (2–4%),
      and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Coverage validation is fragmented across policy admin, endorsements, and
      broker correspondence, delaying first contact by 1–2 business days and
      increasing leakage.
    - >-
      Inconsistent triage/routing: 5–10% of severe claims are escalated late;
      adjuster assignment misalignment increases cycle time and indemnity by
      3–7%.
    - >-
      Omnichannel fragmentation: intake via email, portal, and phone lacks a
      unified queue and audit trail; poor deduplication and threading increase
      handle time.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit gaps: insufficient PII redaction and incomplete audit
      trails complicate SOC 2/ISO audits and state DOI inquiries.
    - >-
      Seasonality and catastrophe events create unplanned overtime, call
      abandonment (5–10%), and reliance on temporary staff with high error
      rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel intake: ingest FNOL from email, web portals (webhooks/APIs),
      and voice (IVR/call) with speech-to-text and real-time form fill.
    - >-
      AI extraction: parse narratives and attachments for policy number,
      insured/claimant, loss time/location, loss type, injury indicators, VIN,
      property address, police report, photos.
    - >-
      Coverage validation: connect to policy administration systems and
      endorsement stores to validate active coverage, deductibles, limits, and
      exclusions; flag gaps.
    - >-
      Severity triage and routing: ML scoring to classify severity, injury risk,
      litigation potential, and total loss likelihood; auto-assign to
      queues/adjusters; prioritize FNOL callbacks.
    - >-
      Automated claim setup: create claim file in Guidewire/Duck Creek/Sapiens
      or TPA platforms; pre-populate fields, create tasks/diaries/checklists,
      and send insured/broker notifications.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: configurable confidence thresholds route uncertain
      fields to reviewers; learn from corrections to improve models.
    - >-
      Audit, analytics, and governance: end-to-end audit trail, data quality
      dashboards, SLA monitoring, and model performance tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce FNOL handle time by 60–80%, accelerate time-to-first-contact by up to
    1 business day, and achieve 50–70% straight-through claim setup with
    verified coverage—omnichannel intake, insurance-tuned AI extraction and
    triage, and one-click creation in core claim systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Insurance-tuned FNOL models trained on diverse, labeled intake data across
    email, portal, and voice; certified, low-latency connectors to major core
    systems; configurable coverage rule packs by LOB/state; and an
    adjuster-in-the-loop workflow that continuously improves model
    accuracy—backed by SOC 2 Type II and enterprise procurement wins that create
    switching costs.
