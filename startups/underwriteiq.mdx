  problem:
    - >-
      Manual submission intake and data entry from emails/ACORD PDFs/excels
      consumes 20–60 minutes per submission and ties up underwriting assistants
      and junior underwriters.
    - >-
      Incomplete or inaccurate data in submissions leads to 1–3 back-and-forth
      cycles with brokers, delaying quotes by 1–5 days and lowering hit rates
      (each day delay can reduce bind rate by 10–20% in competitive markets).
    - >-
      Low straight-through-processing (STP) in personal lines (<40%) and
      near-zero in most commercial lines; too many low-value risks reach
      underwriters while high-value, clean risks are delayed in queues.
    - >-
      Fragmented third-party data landscape (Verisk, LexisNexis, D&B, OSHA, DOT,
      property imagery, geospatial) requires multiple contracts, complex
      integrations, and cost leakage from redundant lookups.
    - >-
      Limited risk triage and weak explainability/audit trails create model
      governance, compliance, and regulator concerns (GLBA, CCPA, FCRA
      implications for credit/consumer data; NAIC AI principles).
    - >-
      Underwriting cost per submission remains high ($15–$60 for commercial;
      $2–$10 for personal) and is poorly correlated to bound premium due to lack
      of early triage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated submission ingestion from email watchboxes, portals, SFTP and
      APIs; OCR/IDP for ACORD, supplements, loss runs, statements of values,
      COIs, schedules, and free-form broker emails.
    - >-
      Prefill mapping to ACORD (125/126/140/130/etc.), ISO forms, and
      carrier-specific data models; push to core systems/workbenches via APIs or
      RPA fallback.
    - >-
      Orchestrated third-party enrichment (D&B, OSHA/DOT/FMCSA, property
      imagery/perils, geocoding/flood/wildfire/crime, VIN/business entity
      resolution, CLUE where permissible) with dedupe, caching, and configurable
      spend limits.
    - >-
      Risk triage scoring and rules: appetite fit, underwriting refer/decline
      flags, exposure hotspots (roof condition, CAT perils, OSHA violations, DOT
      safety rating, vacancy), and potential fraud anomalies.
    - >-
      Explainability and governance: full data lineage, source-level confidence,
      model cards, challenger models, and adverse action support when consumer
      data is used.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI for low-confidence fields and exceptions;
      continuous learning from underwriter corrections with carrier-controlled
      feedback loops.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered intake-to-decision layer that turns messy submissions into
    prefilled applications and explainable risk flags in under 2 minutes,
    lifting STP 2–3x, cutting time-to-quote by 50–80%, and improving new
    business hit rate by 5–10 points with audit-ready lineage and configurable
    cost controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Insurance-native, end-to-end pipeline (documents → prefill → enriched
    triage) with a large template library, prebuilt core-system connectors, and
    a governance-grade explainability layer. Cost-aware data orchestration
    reduces third-party spend while preserving accuracy. Continuous learning
    from curated underwriter feedback and cross-template generalization
    accelerates accuracy gains without sharing customer PII or proprietary data.

  character: >-
    Underwriting, operations, and product leaders at Other Direct Insurance
    (non‑life) carriers who want faster, cleaner submissions and confident risk
    selection across personal and commercial P&C.
  problem: >-
    Submissions arrive incomplete and unstructured; underwriters rekey from PDFs
    and emails; third‑party data is fragmented. Cycle times slip, loss‑ratio
    pressure rises, and agents get frustrated. Underwriters should
    underwrite—not hunt, copy, and paste data.
  guide: >-
    We understand carrier workflows and regulatory demands. Our team builds
    production‑grade extraction and enrichment for P&C lines and integrates with
    common policy admin, intake, and document systems. We provide clear
    implementation playbooks, secure data handling, and ongoing model
    governance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest emails, portals, and broker feeds; map lines and forms.
    2) Enrich: plug in approved third‑party data and appetite/risk rules. 3)
    Prefill & triage: deliver structured applications and risk flags into your
    workbench. 4) Govern: dashboards, QA sampling, lineage, and
    human‑in‑the‑loop controls. Option: run a low‑risk pilot on one line with
    clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute discovery and launch a pilot. Transitional:
    Request a sample prefill and risk‑triage report using de‑identified
    submissions.
  success: >-
    Minutes to prefilled, audit‑ready applications; higher submission quality;
    faster quote turnaround; improved hit/bind ratios; better agent experience;
    more capacity per underwriter; consistent appetite enforcement; traceable
    data lineage and cleaner audits.
  failure: >-
    Stay stuck with slow, manual intake; missed SLAs and broker frustration;
    inconsistent selection and leakage; higher E&O exposure and adverse
    selection; wasted underwriting talent and stalled growth.
