  problem:
    - >-
      Contractors waste 30–90 minutes per inbound lead qualifying by phone/text
      and roughing out ranges before a site visit.
    - >-
      Many leads are price shoppers; 30–50% never convert, but still consume
      estimator time and windshield time.
    - Homeowners expect instant answers; delays reduce contact and win rates.
    - >-
      Existing measurement tools (e.g., full 3D scans or aerial reports) are too
      slow/expensive for top‑of‑funnel triage.
    - >-
      Price ranges vary by region, material, stories, and home complexity;
      junior staff struggle to set correct expectations.
    - >-
      Disorganized homeowner photos (angles/quality) often make rough estimates
      unreliable or unusable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Homeowner/CSR intake link: upload 4–8 exterior photos and enter address;
      instant quality checks guide the capture.
    - >-
      Auto-enrichment: pull parcel data (lot size, living area, year built),
      stories, and region; infer perimeter/height with computer vision + rules
      of thumb; adjust by roof pitch/gables.
    - >-
      AI price range engine: combine detected wall area, openings, corners, and
      local labor/material indices to produce Good/Better/Best ranges for common
      materials (vinyl, fiber cement, engineered wood) with configurable price
      books.
    - >-
      Contractor console: review/edit detected parameters, set margin, add
      promos/financing, generate a shareable homeowner mini-report (and
      SMS/email it).
    - >-
      Lead triage: score by budget fit and project complexity; auto-route to
      sales pipeline in CRM; schedule in-home for only high-propensity leads.
    - >-
      Accuracy feedback loop: back-test against closed job actuals to calibrate
      per-region price books and improve model (MAPE target <15% for standard
      jobs).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Under 90 seconds from homeowner photos + address to a contractor-branded,
    data-backed siding price range and options that filters tire-kickers,
    prioritizes high-fit leads, and saves 5–10+ hours per rep per week.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A siding-specific vision + pricing dataset tied to real closed contracts and
    normalized price books by region/material, delivered via a frictionless
    homeowner intake that doesn’t require full 3D scans—yielding sub‑2‑minute,
    low-cost ranges with validated accuracy. Continuous calibration from pilot
    partners and distributor price feeds compounds over time.
