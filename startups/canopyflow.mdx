  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly tasks (potting, pruning, spacing, spraying, shipping) collide with
      limited crews, weather, and compliance windows, causing overtime and
      missed ship dates
    - >-
      Lack of integrated visibility across crops, lots, and crews leads to
      reactive firefighting and idle time between tasks
    - >-
      Pesticide REI/PHI rules are hard to coordinate across blocks, causing
      blocked access, rescheduling, and compliance risk
    - >-
      Weather variability (rain, heat, wind) disrupts plans; manual replanning
      is slow and error-prone
    - >-
      Labor is 35–55% of COGS in nurseries; most operations lack data-driven
      scheduling, yielding 8–15% avoidable labor hours
    - >-
      Inventory readiness and ship waves are misaligned, reducing order fill
      rate and creating costly rework and rush logistics
    - >-
      Data is siloed in ERP, spreadsheets, and whiteboards; no single source of
      truth for task status and capacity utilization
  solution:
    - >-
      AI planning service that generates a weekly, hour-by-hour task sequence
      optimized for crew skills, equipment, weather, and compliance
    - >-
      Constraint solver that respects REI/PHI intervals, wind thresholds for
      spraying, potting line throughput, dock capacity, and picking waves
    - >-
      Dynamic replanning engine that updates schedules within minutes as
      weather, orders, or labor availability changes
    - >-
      Mobile bilingual (EN/ES) work orders and time capture for crew leads;
      offline-capable with QR/barcode batch scanning
    - >-
      What-if simulation for managers to test labor adds, weather shifts, or
      order changes and see cost/service impacts
    - >-
      Integrations to nursery ERPs for inventory, orders, crop stages, and to
      weather APIs for localized forecasts and degree days
    - >-
      Analytics that benchmark task durations by crop/size and generate
      continuous improvement recommendations
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weather-aware, compliance-safe weekly scheduling that sequences potting,
    pruning, spacing, spraying, and shipping against real crew capacity to cut
    labor hours 8–12%, boost on-time shipping 10–20 points, and eliminate
    REI/PHI conflicts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary dataset of nursery task durations and compliance constraints
    across species and container sizes, combined with a scheduler that encodes
    REI/PHI, weather, and equipment throughput. Early partnerships with major
    nursery ERPs and OEMs plus bilingual, field-proven workflows lower switching
    costs and accelerate time-to-value.

  character: >-
    Nursery and tree production operations leaders who must align potting,
    pruning, spacing, spraying, and shipping with crew capacity and weather to
    hit ship dates and protect crop quality.
  problem: >-
    Weekly juggling without a realistic schedule causes missed ship dates,
    overtime, idle rainy days, wasted sunny windows, and inconsistent quality
    because tasks aren’t sequenced to labor or forecasted weather.
  guide: >-
    Labor & Task Scheduling Optimizer is an AI scheduler built for nurseries,
    generating a clear weekly plan that sequences tasks by crop priority, crew
    availability, equipment, and weather windows—so your team always knows what
    to do next.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: import crops/blocks, tasks, crews, equipment; pull local weather.

    - Plan: receive a weekly schedule with daily priorities and what-if
    scenarios.

    - Execute: mark progress; the AI rebalances as conditions change.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 2-week pilot or book a 20-minute demo to see your sample weekly
    plan.
  success: >-
    On-time shipments, higher throughput, fewer overtime hours, better spray
    timing, less rework and waste, and crews confident in a clear daily plan.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting—missed ship dates, lost weather windows, idle crews, crop
    loss, stressed teams, and margins squeezed by overtime and rework.
