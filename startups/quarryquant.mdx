  problem:
    - >-
      Inventory shrinkage and write-offs: 2–8% monthly variance between ERP book
      inventory and actual stockpile tonnage leads to unplanned adjustments at
      financial close.
    - >-
      Manual measurement is slow, risky, and inaccurate: climbing piles with GPS
      rods or eyeballing faces introduces 5–15% error and safety hazards (MSHA
      recordables).
    - >-
      Closing the books drags: cycle counts and quarterly audits create 2–5 day
      delays in period close for multi-site operators.
    - >-
      Regulatory and customer audit pressure: insufficient audit trails for how
      volumes were measured, densities chosen, and variances handled.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: flight data, densities, moisture, production tickets, and
      ERP records live in silos, preventing timely reconciliation and variance
      root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Limited in-house UAV capacity: sites lack standardized SOPs, GNSS/RTK
      workflows, and trained pilots for consistent, repeatable measurements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data processing pipeline: ingest RGB drone imagery or LiDAR,
      apply RTK/PPK corrections, generate dense point clouds/orthos, and compute
      volumes with ±1–2% error on typical quarry piles.
    - >-
      AI pile detection and segmentation: auto-identify individual stockpiles,
      boundaries, and base planes; handle irregular faces and adjacent piles.
    - >-
      Tonnage conversion engine: apply product-specific bulk densities and
      real-time or modeled moisture to convert cubic volume to tons with
      traceable assumptions.
    - >-
      ERP reconciliation: map SKUs/products and locations to ERP items; post
      cycle count adjustments or journal entries via connectors (SAP, Oracle,
      Command Alkon/Apex) with approvals and audit trails.
    - >-
      Variance analytics: highlight deltas vs ERP by pile/product/date; provide
      root-cause suggestions using production tickets, scale-house data, and
      historical shrinkage patterns.
    - >-
      Scheduling and SOPs: standardized, MSHA-safe flight plans and checklists;
      support in-house pilots or certified partner DSPs; auto-reminders for
      monthly/quarterly counts.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit: immutable logs, versioned density tables, signed-off
      surveys, exportable reports for internal/external auditors.
    - >-
      Change detection: time-series comparisons to detect theft, sloughing,
      compaction, or misallocations; alert thresholds (e.g., >2% variance or
      >500 tons).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate drone/LiDAR stockpile volumes automatically reconciled to ERP
    inventory within 24 hours—cutting write-offs by 30–70%, eliminating unsafe
    manual measurements, and delivering audit-ready, density- and moisture-aware
    tonnage with seamless ERP sync.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built reconciliation engine for aggregates that marries volumetrics
    with ERP, density, and moisture—trained on a large, labeled dataset of
    quarry piles—plus certified workflows, high ERP integration depth, and an
    audit trail already accepted by finance teams and external auditors at early
    lighthouse customers.

  character: >-
    Quarry and plant leaders in crushed and broken stone mining (Ops Managers,
    Controllers, Mine Engineers) who need trustworthy stockpile inventory
    without halting production or risking crews.
  problem: >-
    External — Stockpiles change daily; manual surveys are slow, unsafe, and
    inconsistent, causing ERP variances and auditor scrutiny. Internal — They’re
    tired of guesswork and month‑end stress from numbers no one fully trusts.
    Philosophical — Production and finance deserve the same, single source of
    truth for inventory.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost, safety, and credibility hits caused by inventory
    variance in quarries. Our AI service processes drone/LiDAR data to compute
    volumes, converts to tonnage with material‑specific densities/moisture, and
    reconciles against your ERP—producing audit‑ready results with clear QA and
    method statements.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Fly piles with a drone or LiDAR (we provide flight plans/ground
    control guidance). 2) Upload data; we run photogrammetry/LiDAR processing,
    QA, volume calc, and tonnage conversion by material. 3) Reconcile to ERP
    movements; deliver variance report, audit pack, and trend dashboards.
    Agreement: transparent pricing, no heavy IT lift, secure data handling,
    start with a single‑site pilot and expand.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or book a pilot survey. Transitional:
    Download a sample audit report and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Accurate, audit‑ready inventory; faster month‑end close; fewer write‑offs;
    safer crews (no walking piles); better cash flow and production planning;
    shared confidence between finance and operations.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing guesswork and risk: unsafe manual counts, disputed numbers, surprise
    write‑offs, auditor findings, margin leakage, and working capital trapped in
    miscounted inventory.
