leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual whiteboard/Excel scheduling causes missed due dates and constant
      firefighting; typical on‑time install rates 70–85%.
    - >-
      High sequence‑dependent changeovers on saws/CNCs (material, color,
      thickness, edge profile, tooling) consume 15–45 minutes per job; unbatched
      sequences waste 5–10 machine hours/week.
    - >-
      Install crews idle or overbooked due to poor coordination with fabrication
      readiness and customer time windows (4–8 idle hours/crew/week).
    - >-
      Rush jobs and rework spike overtime and scrap/remakes (remakes often 3–6%
      of jobs); poor visibility to constraints exacerbates this.
    - >-
      No unified view across templating → CAD/nesting → saw → CNC → polish → QC
      → install; upstream delays ripple downstream.
    - >-
      Underutilization of expensive machines (CNCs $200k–$500k) because of
      unbalanced flow; OEE often <55% in small/mid shops.
    - >-
      Inefficient material batching leads to frequent slab moves and re-racking,
      raising handling risk and damage.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/CRM tools (e.g., quoting/job tracking) lack true
      optimization; calendars don’t minimize changeovers or respect resource
      constraints.
    - >-
      Limited data to estimate realistic lead times; promises to
      builders/retailers slip, causing chargebacks and lost referrals.
    - >-
      Seasonality and volatile mix (retail vs builder) make capacity planning
      difficult; owners lack forward load visibility for hiring/OT decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based optimization (hybrid CP/MILP with heuristics) that models
      parallel machines, sequence-dependent setups, secondary resources
      (cranes/fixtures), and install crew time windows.
    - >-
      Automated batching by material, thickness, color group, and edge profile
      to minimize tool changes and slab moves while honoring due dates and SLA
      priorities.
    - >-
      Integrated install scheduling that aligns truck routing, crew skills, and
      customer availability to fabrication readiness.
    - >-
      What-if planning: simulate rush jobs, overtime, or subcontracting;
      quantify impact on due dates and costs before committing.
    - >-
      Dynamic lead-time estimator using historical cycle times by material/edge
      complexity; pushes realistic promise dates back to sales/CSR.
    - >-
      Live machine signals (optional) via non-invasive IoT sensors or machine
      connectors to auto-actualize start/finish times and predict delays.
    - >-
      2-click daily release: suggested schedule reviewed and published;
      drag-and-drop with AI re-optimization localized to affected resources.
    - >-
      APIs and native connectors to Moraware/ActionFlow/Slabsmith/ETemplate for
      jobs, materials, drawings, and statuses.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit: OTD, schedule adherence, changeover minutes/job, installer
      utilization, expedite rate, overtime, and remake rate with weekly
      trendlines.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Stone-specific AI scheduler that sequences jobs across saws, CNCs,
    polishers, and install crews to meet due dates while minimizing
    changeovers—boosting on-time installs to >95%, cutting machine changeover
    time 20–40%, and increasing weekly throughput 10–20% without added
    headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A stone-specific optimization engine and changeover taxonomy trained on real
    fabricator data, plus a connector ecosystem (Moraware/ActionFlow/Slabsmith
    and major OEMs) that lowers switching costs and time-to-value to weeks—not
    months—backed by OEM/association endorsements and measurable ROI case
    studies.
