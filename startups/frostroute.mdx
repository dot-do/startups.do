  problem:
    - >-
      Manual daily route planning on whiteboards/spreadsheets leads to 10–25%
      excess miles and driver hours, especially during summer peaks.
    - >-
      Lack of live ETAs causes retail partners (c-stores, groceries,
      restaurants, event venues) to over-order, call centers to field status
      calls, and strained relationships.
    - >-
      Ice is perishable: melt/shrink increases with long routes, heat waves, and
      idling; poor routing raises spoilage and write-offs by 3–8%.
    - >-
      Driver turnover and seasonal hiring make route consistency hard; tribal
      knowledge is lost, increasing planning time and missed time windows.
    - >-
      Hot-weather demand spikes require mid-day reroutes; most fleets cannot
      re-optimize quickly with traffic and time windows considered.
    - >-
      Retailers increasingly expect vendor-managed inventory with
      proof-of-delivery and on-time compliance; missed windows risk fines or
      losing shelf space.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack (telematics, TMS, SMS tools) creates operational
      drag and data silos; no single source of truth for delivery status.
    - >-
      Planning time consumes supervisors (1–3 hours/day) who could otherwise
      focus on production and service recovery.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI route optimization that accounts for capacity (bags/pallets), cooler
      capacities per stop, load/unload times, driver hours, time windows, and
      depot constraints.
    - >-
      Heat- and melt-aware planning: weather-adjusted route duration limits and
      service priority for high-risk stops during heat waves.
    - >-
      Live ETAs with branded SMS/email links; two-way updates for store managers
      to confirm access or special instructions.
    - >-
      Driver mobile app (iOS/Android) with offline mode: stop list,
      turn-by-turn, barcode/QR for asset tracking, photo POD, notes, and
      signature capture.
    - >-
      Mid-day dynamic re-optimization with traffic and last-minute orders; auto
      re-sequencing and customer ETA updates.
    - >-
      Telematics integration (Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect) for
      GPS/ignition, geofencing, and auto status updates (arrived/departed).
    - >-
      Predictive demand and prioritization add-on using weather forecasts and
      historical sales to schedule proactive replenishments.
    - >-
      Operations dashboard: miles/stop, on-time %, ETA accuracy, service
      exceptions, and ROI reporting; exports to accounting/ERP.
    - >-
      Multi-depot scheduling, seasonal calendars, and staffing constraints;
      driver shift templates and union/non-union rule sets.
    - >-
      Open APIs and flat-file connectors for orders, inventory, and retailer
      lists; SSO for enterprise security.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI routing and live ETA platform for packaged ice that cuts
    miles 10–20%, reduces driver hours 8–15%, and lowers melt/shrink 5–10% while
    keeping retailers informed with accurate ETAs and proof-of-delivery.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization for packaged ice: melt-aware routing, store cooler
    capacity database, and weather-driven prioritization combined with prebuilt
    telematics and route accounting integrations. Network effects from
    aggregated delivery/ETA data improve models and benchmarks season over
    season.

  character: >-
    Ice manufacturing route managers and dispatchers who must deliver bagged ice
    to retailers on time with limited trucks, drivers, and tight delivery
    windows.
  problem: >-
    Manual routing wastes miles and hours; summer spikes cause missed windows
    and stockouts; customers call nonstop for ETAs; fuel, overtime, and driver
    frustration climb—when all they want is smooth, profitable routes and happy
    stores.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of ice season. Our AI route optimization and
    live-ETA platform, purpose-built for bagged ice deliveries, replaces
    guesswork with data to cut miles, boost on-time performance, and calm the
    phones.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders and locations; set truck capacities, delivery windows, and
    depot rules. 2) Auto-build optimal routes; dispatch to drivers; share live
    ETAs with customers. 3) Monitor progress in real time and review daily
    scorecards to improve.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot for one depot.
  success: >-
    More stops per truck with fewer miles and overtime; on-time deliveries;
    real-time ETAs that reduce 'where's my ice?' calls; loyal retail accounts;
    operations that scale smoothly through peak heat.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning fuel and hours, missing windows, fielding angry calls, and
    risking melted product, stockouts, and lost accounts while competitors win
    your routes.
