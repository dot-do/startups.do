  problem:
    - >-
      Branch fill rates in paint/coatings distribution drop during
      backorders/stockouts because counter staff lack safe, technically
      compatible substitutes at order-entry time.
    - >-
      Assortments are often vendor-driven or copy/paste across branches,
      ignoring local demand, seasonality, climate/VOC regulations, substrate
      mix, and trade mix (residential repaint vs industrial), leading to dead
      stock and missed sales.
    - >-
      Current ERP tools (min/max, static cross references) are manual, brittle,
      and don’t use product technical attributes (base/tint system, sheen, resin
      system, VOC limits, dry time, color compatibility) or real-time
      availability.
    - >-
      New product intros/discontinuations and regulatory changes (e.g., regional
      VOC limits) create confusion and misfills; there’s no validated, auditable
      substitution logic to protect warranty/compliance.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP/PIM, supplier catalogs, and TDS/SDS PDFs,
      making attribute normalization and compatibility matching labor-intensive.
    - >-
      Leaders cannot quantify the ROI of assortment or substitution decisions;
      there is no closed-loop measurement of recovered sales, GMROI, or
      contractor retention.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion connectors for ERP/POS, WMS, e-commerce, supplier catalogs,
      and TDS/SDS; NLP to extract technical attributes (base/tint system, sheen,
      VOC, resin, substrate, dry time, colorant system).
    - >-
      Branch-level demand modeling to propose core assortment under space and
      working capital constraints; considers seasonality, cannibalization, local
      trade mix, and lead times.
    - >-
      Substitution Knowledge Graph for paints, coatings, and sundries linking
      compatibility rules (e.g., tint base A–D, VOC region, resin system, sheen
      equivalence, tool/material fit) with real-time inventory and delivery
      promises.
    - >-
      Real-time recommendations in order entry/e-commerce: safe substitutes for
      stockouts/backorders with reason codes and compliance/warranty notes.
    - >-
      Assortment and replenishment actions: PO/transfer suggestions, SKU
      rationalization, new SKU trials, and planogram exports with measurable
      impact projections.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics: dashboards for fill rate lift, recovered sales,
      inventory turns, GMROI, substitution acceptance, and A/B testing outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase branch fill rate and GMROI with coatings-specific AI that sets a
    core assortment per branch and gives compliance-safe, technically verified
    substitutions at the counter and online—integrated into your ERP workflows,
    measurable within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A coatings-specific substitution graph validated with TDS/SDS extraction and
    field A/B tests, including tint-system compatibility and VOC/regional
    compliance—embedded directly in distributor ERPs for real-time use. Network
    effects improve recommendations as more branches validate alternates,
    creating a defensible feedback loop competitors lack.
