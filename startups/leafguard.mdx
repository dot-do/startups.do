  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers face fragmented, state-and-local-specific tobacco/ENDS
      licensing rules, causing slow retailer onboarding (often 1–3 business
      days) and shipment delays.
    - >-
      Manual KYB/license checks across 50 states and hundreds of local
      jurisdictions create high labor costs (3–20 FTEs for mid-to-large
      distributors) and inconsistent outcomes.
    - >-
      Order holds due to missing/expired licenses or jurisdictional product bans
      are applied inconsistently, risking illegal shipments or unnecessary
      revenue loss.
    - >-
      Renewal tracking for thousands of retailer licenses is error-prone;
      expirations lead to preventable order cancellations and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Existing generic KYB tools lack tobacco/ENDS-specific checks (e.g., local
      flavor bans, PACT Act obligations), forcing custom spreadsheets and
      one-off scripts.
    - >-
      Audit and regulatory inquiries require evidence packs; compiling these
      retroactively consumes days/weeks and risks fines.
    - >-
      ERP/OMS/EDI systems don’t natively enforce dynamic compliance rules,
      creating gaps between verification and order release.
    - >-
      High compliance risk: per-violation fines, distributor license jeopardy,
      and carrier refusals; reputational risk with manufacturers and retailers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified KYB + license verification API and dashboard that validates
      business identity, state/local tobacco/ENDS licenses, and PACT Act-related
      registrations for retailers.
    - >-
      Jurisdictional rules engine mapping state and local restrictions (e.g.,
      flavor bans, ENDS shipment limits) to specific SKUs/ship-to addresses to
      prevent illegal shipments.
    - >-
      Automated order hold/release: webhooks and connectors to ERP/OMS/EDI apply
      holds for missing/invalid licenses and auto-release when conditions are
      met.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and renewal management: track license expirations,
      auto-remind retailers, facilitate application workflows, and store
      documents.
    - >-
      Risk scoring and watchlists: blend public records, tax status, OFAC/SDN,
      adverse media, and historical shipment behavior to prioritize manual
      reviews.
    - >-
      Audit evidence pack: immutable logs, screenshots or data snapshots of
      license pages, timestamps, chain-of-custody for decisions; exportable for
      regulators.
    - >-
      Admin and analytics: SLA dashboards, false positive analysis, coverage
      maps, retailer portfolio health, and KPI reporting.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II, data minimization, encryption,
      role-based access; configurable data retention policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven KYB + tobacco/ENDS license and jurisdictional rule verification
    that auto-decides holds/releases and manages renewals—reducing manual
    workload 60–80%, increasing auto-release to 85–95%, and cutting compliance
    incidents to near zero with audit-ready evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, SKU-aware compliance engine purpose-built for tobacco/ENDS
    with a living jurisdictional rules library and evidence-grade snapshots;
    prebuilt ERP/EDI integrations for true order-release automation; and a
    network effect from a consented retailer verification graph that reduces
    friction and speeds onboarding across participating wholesalers.

  character: >-
    Operations and compliance leaders at tobacco and vape wholesalers who need
    to ship orders fast without risking non‑compliance.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented state license data, changing rules, and manual checks
    slow releases and cause mistakes. Internal: Teams worry they’ll miss an
    expired license or risky retailer and trigger penalties. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t have to choose between compliance and growth—accurate verification
    should be automatic.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the cost of delayed orders, surprise audits, and sleepless
    nights over PACT/state compliance. Authority: Purpose‑built KYB + license
    verification for regulated commerce; connects to state registries, PACT
    requirements, business registries, sanctions/watchlists, and carrier rules
    to deliver audit‑ready decisions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Plug into your ERP/OMS/cart and data sources (state license
    registries, KYB, watchlists). 2) Verify: AI validates business identity,
    licenses, status/expiration, geography restrictions, and risk—then scores
    each account/order. 3) Automate: Hold/release orders, trigger renewals,
    alert on expirations, and log an audit trail—no spreadsheets.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14‑day pilot and automate holds/releases. Transitional:
    Download the Tobacco & ENDS Compliance Checklist + ROI model.
  success: >-
    Release good orders instantly; prevent shipments to unlicensed or high‑risk
    retailers; cut manual review time by 80%+; pass audits with traceable
    decisions; reduce chargebacks/fines; keep renewals on time; grow revenue
    with confidence.
  failure: >-
    Without this, orders stall in review, licenses lapse unnoticed, risky
    shipments slip through, audits fail, fines mount, inventory backs up, and
    customer trust erodes.
