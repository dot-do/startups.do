  problem:
    - >-
      Growers must hit crop-specific DLI and photoperiod targets despite highly
      variable natural irradiance, or yields and quality suffer.
    - >-
      Supplemental lighting (LED/HPS) is often run on fixed schedules, wasting
      energy during sunny periods and missing targets during cloudy periods.
    - >-
      Electricity tariffs (TOU, demand charges, RTP) are complex; most growers
      lack tools to shift lighting to lower-cost hours without risking plant
      stress or flowering errors.
    - >-
      HPS lighting adds heat; failing to coordinate lighting with heating, CO2,
      and shading can increase total energy costs and cause climate instability.
    - >-
      Existing controllers are vendor-specific, not tariff-aware, and rarely
      provide verifiable M&V of savings or agronomic impact.
    - >-
      Labor-constrained teams need simple, automated schedules with override
      safety and compliance with light-curfew rules and light trespass concerns.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest hourly/detailed irradiance forecasts (global and diffuse), on-site
      PAR sensors, and tariff schedules (TOU/RTP/demand).
    - >-
      Compute crop-specific targets (DLI, photoperiod, intensity ceilings, ramp
      rates) with grower-configured constraints by zone/bench.
    - >-
      Optimize lighting plans day-ahead and intra-day: when to dim, switch, or
      curtail to meet DLI at the lowest energy cost, factoring HPS heat
      substitution for heating load.
    - >-
      Dispatch control setpoints to climate computers/lighting controllers
      (Priva, Hoogendoorn, Argus, Autogrow, Signify/Fluence) via secure gateway;
      fail-safe to last known safe schedule.
    - >-
      Continuously re-forecast every 5–15 minutes using sensor feedback;
      maintain DLI compliance with risk buffers under cloud uncertainty.
    - >-
      Provide M&V dashboard: kWh, $ saved vs baseline, achieved DLI/photoperiod,
      $/mol delivered, yield KPIs; export reports for utility rebates and DR
      programs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven lighting schedules that guarantee crop DLI/photoperiod while
    minimizing $/mol via irradiance and tariff forecasts—validated by automated
    M&V.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary $/mol optimization that fuses irradiance and tariff forecasts
    with crop physiology and HPS heat substitution, delivered via cross-vendor
    integrations and backed by utility-grade M&V and field trials—difficult for
    single-vendor controllers to replicate.
