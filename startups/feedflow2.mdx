  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, highly seasonal demand at the SKU/customer/region level
      (impacted by animal placements, weather, and promotions) causes frequent
      stockouts and overproduction; most planners still rely on spreadsheets and
      judgmental overrides.
    - >-
      Weekly production plans are often infeasible because they ignore real
      capacity constraints: pelletizer rates, mixer batch sizes, bagging line
      throughput, sanitation/flush for medicated vs non‑medicated products,
      allergen segregation, and limited shift/labor availability.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers and sanitation requirements are not
      optimized, leading to 10–25% of scheduled hours lost to setups and
      flushes.
    - >-
      Working capital is tied up in slow-moving finished goods; inventory turns
      lag peers (e.g., 6–8 turns vs 10–12 for best-in-class); obsolescence and
      write-offs occur due to short shelf life on certain supplements/premixes.
    - >-
      Service levels and OTIF suffer (often 90–94%), driving costly expedites
      and customer dissatisfaction; sales lacks reliable capable-to-promise
      (CTP) dates for large orders.
    - >-
      Data needed for planning is fragmented across ERP, MES, formulation
      systems, and spreadsheets; master data quality issues (BOMs, routings,
      calendars) erode trust in plans.
    - >-
      No easy way to run scenarios (e.g., commodity shortages, unplanned
      downtime, demand surges) and pick an optimal, auditable production plan.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and harmonization from ERP (orders/shipments, customers),
      MES (production history, downtime), formulation/BOM, routings,
      calendars/shifts, capacities, QC/hold, lot attributes
      (medicated/non‑medicated), and distribution lanes.
    - >-
      SKU-customer-region hierarchical, probabilistic demand forecasting with
      reconciliation across hierarchy; intermittent-demand handling for slow
      movers; bias control; automatic event/seasonality detection (weather,
      placements, holidays).
    - >-
      Causal features for demand: animal placement schedules, regional weather
      (heating/cooling degree days), commodity price signals, promos/contracts;
      automated feature selection and model governance.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware weekly production planning using mixed-integer
      optimization: lot sizing, line assignment, sequence-dependent setup/flush,
      labor/shift limits, maintenance windows, campaign planning for
      premixes/additives, and shelf-life constraints; multi-mill production and
      intersite transfers.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and CTP: simulate demand surges, capacity losses, or
      ingredient constraints; provide order-level promise dates and feasible
      expedite options (with cost impact).
    - >-
      Plan execution alignment: daily finite-capacity resequencing to absorb
      short-term changes while maintaining plan stability; schedule-adherence
      tracking.
    - >-
      User experience for planners: explainable forecasts (drivers, confidence
      intervals), constraint diagnostics (what limited production), and guided
      overrides with guardrails.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors for SAP, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Infor, and common
      MES; APIs for weather and commodity data; SSO and audit trails for
      compliance.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 8–12 week pilot for 1–2 mills and 200–500 SKUs
      with success criteria (WMAPE, service level, changeover reduction).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Raise fill rate to 97%+, cut changeover hours by 20%+, and reduce finished
    goods inventory by 15–25% in 90 days via SKU-level probabilistic forecasting
    and constraint-aware weekly production plans purpose-built for feed mills.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feed-mill–specific optimization and forecasting stack with proven
    constraint libraries (medicated segregation, setup/flush, bagging vs bulk),
    prebuilt ERP/MES connectors, and an implementation playbook that delivers
    measurable KPI lift within 90 days—difficult for generic APS/IBP tools to
    replicate quickly.

    Operations, planning, and supply chain leaders at Other Animal Food (NAICS
    311119) mills who need reliable SKU/customer/region forecasts and a feasible
    weekly production plan that respects capacity and changeover constraints.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile orders by dealer/co-op and region, seasonal swings, SKU
    proliferation, ingredient variability, and strict allergen/medication
    changeovers.

    Internal: Spreadsheet-driven planning, siloed data, forecasts that miss at
    SKU-customer level, and schedules that ignore true line rates, batching, and
    setup times.

    Philosophical: It should not be guesswork to decide what to make next week.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know feed mills live between stockouts and overstock, juggling
    medicated/allergen sequences, pack changes, and tight service commitments.

    Authority: Purpose-built for 311119. Models formulas, routings, batching,
    changeover matrices, line speeds, and pack formats. Proven to raise schedule
    adherence and service while cutting changeovers and inventory. Secure,

  plan: >-
    1) Connect and model: Pull orders/shipments, BOM/formulas, routings,
    capacities, and changeover matrices; map to your lines and SKUs.

    2) Calibrate and pilot: Tune SKU-customer/region forecasts and constraints;
    run side-by-side for 4–6 weeks to validate accuracy and feasibility.

    3) Go live: Produce a weekly finite-capacity plan and daily sequences;
    enable what-if scenarios; monitor KPIs with continuous learning.

  success: |-
    - 10–25% improvement in SKU-customer/region forecast MAPE
    - 15–30% fewer changeovers or setup hours
    - 2–5% throughput lift with higher schedule adherence
    - 10–20% lower finished goods inventory while maintaining 95–98% OTIF
    - Planners generate a feasible weekly plan in hours, not days
    - Fewer expedites and more confident commitments to dealers and integrators
  failure: |-
    - Another year of spreadsheet firefighting and tribal-knowledge scheduling
    - Stockouts on priority SKUs with excess of slow movers
    - Overtime, expediting costs, and missed margins
    - Idle lines waiting on ingredients or extended allergen/medicated cleanouts
    - Lost customer trust and planner burnout
