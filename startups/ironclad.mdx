leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      DFMEA/PFMEA creation is slow (4–12 weeks per subsystem) and highly manual,
      relying on tribal knowledge spread across design, manufacturing, and
      quality teams.
    - >-
      Failure modes are inconsistently identified from CAD, BOM, and routings;
      important interfaces and special characteristics are often missed during
      early design gates.
    - >-
      Maintaining FMEAs as designs/processes change is error-prone; change
      impact analysis is weak and traceability to CAD/BOM/MBSE/PLM artifacts is
      limited.
    - >-
      Defense programs require rigorous evidence for risk management (e.g.,
      MIL-STD-882, legacy MIL-STD-1629A practices, AIAG-VDA FMEA, AQAP/NATO
      quality) under tight schedules; rework and audit findings drive cost and
      delay.
    - >-
      Existing PLM/FMEA tools lack AI-driven drafting and defense-specific
      ontologies; spreadsheets and generic tools don’t scale or meet secure
      deployment needs.
    - >-
      Quality escapes and late-found risks increase cost of poor quality (COPQ)
      and jeopardize program milestones; suppliers lack standardized FMEA
      quality and struggle to collaborate securely.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion connectors parse CAD (assemblies, mates, GD&T, materials),
      BOM structure, and process routings/work instructions to auto-extract
      functions, interfaces, and special characteristics.
    - >-
      Defense-grade ontology and knowledge base propose failure modes, causes,
      effects, controls, and initial Severity/Occurrence/Detection with
      rationale and citations to sources (drawings, specs, historical FRACAS).
    - >-
      AI-assisted Action Priority/RPN and mitigation recommendations linked to
      control plans and process characteristics; exports to AIAG-VDA forms and
      customer-specific templates.
    - >-
      Continuous sync: change impact analysis highlights affected DFMEA/PFMEA
      rows when CAD/BOM/process revisions occur; redlines and approvals maintain
      traceability.
    - >-
      Security-first deployment options: on-premises/air-gapped appliance or US
      GovCloud patterns; alignment with NIST 800-171/CMMC L2 controls and ITAR
      data handling.
    - >-
      Workflow and collaboration: reviewer/approver gates, e-signatures, audit
      trails, and supplier portal with scoped data sharing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate auditable, standards-aligned DFMEA/PFMEA drafts directly from CAD,
    BOM, and process data—cutting FMEA drafting time by 50–70%, improving
    failure mode coverage, and keeping analyses synchronized with design/process
    changes in secure, ITAR-compliant deployments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Defense-specific FMEA ontology and interface-extraction IP tuned on armored
    vehicle subsystems, coupled with secure deployment options
    (on-prem/air-gapped, US-person-only tenancy) and deep PLM integrations that
    incumbents and generic LLM tools lack; early reference programs and
    validated ROI create switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Program managers, quality/reliability leads, and manufacturing engineers at
    armored vehicle and tank OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers who must deliver safe,
    compliant designs and processes under tight schedules.
  problem: >-
    - External: Drafting DFMEAs/PFMEAs from complex CAD/BOM/process data is
    slow, manual, and inconsistent; teams must meet AIAG-VDA/SAE J1739 and
    MIL-STD-882 practices, pass audits, and maintain traceability.

    - Internal: Engineers feel overwhelmed by version chaos and fear missing
    critical failure paths that affect mission readiness and safety.

    - Philosophical: Risk shouldn’t be discovered in test or theater—anticipated
    and mitigated at design and process definition.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the burden of building audit-ready FMEAs for complex
    defense systems with strict configuration control and data security.

    - Authority: Built by reliability and manufacturing engineers; aligns to
    AIAG-VDA structure (with RPN/AP), supports MIL-STD-882 hazard thinking,
    integrates with CAD/PLM/MES, and runs in secure, export-controlled
    environments.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Securely connect CAD/BOM/process sources or upload extracts.

    2) Auto-extract functions, interfaces, and steps; propose failure modes,
    effects, causes, controls, and initial RPN/AP.

    3) SMEs review, edit, and accept; assign actions and owners; maintain
    versioned digital thread.

    4) Export to templates and compliance formats; sync with requirements, test,
    and FRACAS.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Human-in-the-loop approvals, full audit trail, and change control.

    - On-prem/VPC options; data never used for model training without consent;
    supports ITAR/DFARS workflows.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a secure demo and 2-week pilot with a representative
    assembly or process.

    - Transitional: Get the checklist—“10 Inputs to Prepare for AI-Assisted
    FMEAs in Defense Manufacturing.”
  success: >-
    - Draft FMEAs in hours, not weeks; consistent structure across programs and
    suppliers.

    - Higher coverage and faster reviews; clear traceability from requirements
    to controls.

    - Audit-ready outputs; accelerated qualifications and smoother supplier
    PPAP-like packages.

    - Fewer late discoveries, reduced rework and cost/schedule risk; improved
    mission readiness and safety.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams face late failure discovery in test/field, escaped
    defects, audit findings, rework, schedule slips, non-compliance risk, and
    potential program/contract impacts.
