  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers still build tows and schedules manually using spreadsheets,
      phone calls, and experience, leading to inconsistent decisions and limited
      ability to replan during disruptions.
    - >-
      High variability in lock congestion, river stages, tow-size limits by
      segment, horsepower and draft constraints, crew hours, and berth
      availability makes optimal assignment computationally complex and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Late arrivals and poor ETA accuracy trigger demurrage, penalties, and
      strained shipper relationships.
    - >-
      Deadhead miles, idle barges in fleeting areas, and suboptimal tow
      composition drive up fuel and charter costs.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across AIS feeds, lock reports, terminal schedules,
      ERPs/TMS, and maintenance systems, preventing a single source of truth for
      planning.
    - >-
      No easy way to run what-if scenarios (e.g., lock outage, high water) or
      quantify the cost vs on-time trade-offs before committing to a plan.
    - >-
      Existing marine software tracks assets and voyages but rarely optimizes
      tow composition and move sequencing for inland constraints at network
      scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer integrating AIS, USACE lock data, NOAA river forecasts,
      terminal berths, ERP/TMS orders, and fleet constraints into a live network
      model.
    - >-
      Optimization engine (mixed-integer/constraint programming plus ML
      forecasts) to recommend tow composition, routing by segment, lockage
      strategy, and sequencing of picks/drops.
    - >-
      Realtime re-optimization and exception management when river levels
      change, lock queues spike, or assets go down.
    - >-
      Scenario planning sandbox to compare cost, ETA, and risk impacts of
      alternatives before execution.
    - >-
      User workflows for dispatchers: suggested plan, explainable trade-offs,
      hard/soft constraint controls, and one-click plan publishing to crew
      apps/APIs.
    - >-
      KPIs dashboard quantifying savings vs baseline: deadhead miles, idle
      hours, fuel/ton-mile, on-time, demurrage, and barge turns.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    TowWise AI automatically assembles optimal tows and sequences moves across
    river segments to meet ETAs and constraints at minimal cost, with real-time
    re-optimization during disruptions—delivering measurable reductions in fuel,
    demurrage, and deadhead while improving on-time performance and asset turns.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built inland waterways optimizer combining a continuously updated
    river digital twin, probabilistic lock congestion forecasts, and explainable
    MIP/CP models—trained on multi-year AIS and lock data—plus deep integrations
    to inland ERPs and dispatcher workflows. Early adopter datasets enable
    lock-specific performance tuning that generic routing vendors cannot easily
    replicate.

  character: >-
    Operations leaders at inland waterway carriers (dispatchers, fleet managers,
    port captains) who must assemble tows and schedule moves to hit ETAs, meet
    constraints, and minimize cost.
  problem: >-
    External: Changing river conditions, lock queues, tow-size rules, crew
    hours, and barge availability make manual planning slow and costly.
    Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting with spreadsheets and radio calls,
    unsure if today’s plan is the best plan. Philosophical: River freight should
    be predictable, safe, and efficient—not a daily guess.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of keeping promises to shippers while juggling
    locks, drafts, crews, and fleeting points. Our team combines river ops
    veterans and optimization engineers; the AI engine integrates with your
    systems, ingests AIS/lock data, and has proven in pilots to cut delays and
    fuel while improving on-time performance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect orders, fleet, constraints, and AIS/lock data. 2) Run
    optimization to assign barges to tows and sequence moves at minimal cost. 3)
    Review, adjust, and approve recommendations. 4) Publish to crews and monitor
    execution. 5) Re-optimize as conditions change. Clear SLA, security, and ROI
    goals agreed up front.

    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot on a subset of your
    fleet. Transitional: Download the Tow Optimization Playbook and request a
    free ROI estimate using your last 90 days of moves.
  success: >-
    Higher fleet throughput and utilization, fewer lock delays and demurrage,
    lower fuel and overtime, reliable ETAs, compliant tows and rested crews,
    happier shippers, and a calm, confident dispatch room.
  failure: >-
    Idle or misassigned barges, missed ETAs and penalties, noncompliant or
    unsafe tows, last-minute reshuffles, blown fuel budgets, crew overtime, and
    lost contracts.
