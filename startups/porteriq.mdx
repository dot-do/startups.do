leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic stockouts on top sellers (10–20% of weeks out-of-stock during peak
      travel and gifting seasons), driving lost sales and brand defection
    - >-
      Overstock and slow-movers tying up 15–30% of working capital due to MOQs,
      vendor pack sizes, and long lead times (60–150 days for many leather
      goods)
    - >-
      Seasonality and event-driven demand (summer travel, back-to-school, Black
      Friday, Chinese New Year) not adequately captured by basic methods,
      causing forecast bias
    - >-
      Fragmented data across POS, e-commerce, marketplaces, and warehouse
      systems makes consolidated SKU/location forecasting hard
    - >-
      New styles, colors, and limited runs create cold-start forecasting
      problems; planners rely on gut feel and spreadsheets
    - >-
      Lead-time variability and missed vendor windows lead to late POs and
      missed peaks; safety stock is set inconsistently
    - >-
      Store clustering and regional patterns (airport stores vs. suburban malls)
      require granular forecasting that current tools don’t support well
    - >-
      Manual planning consumes 10–20 hours per planner per week; lack of
      explainability undermines trust and adoption
    - >-
      PO creation is reactive and error-prone; planners struggle to respect
      MOQs, carton multiples, vendor calendars, and open-to-buy budgets
      simultaneously
    - >-
      Warranty/returns and repairs create noisy demand signals that distort
      reorder calculations
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline that consolidates POS, e-commerce, WMS, and
      marketplace sales with inventory and vendor master data
    - >-
      SKU/location weekly forecasts using hierarchical, seasonality-aware models
      with external signals (holidays, school breaks, weather, travel
      indicators)
    - >-
      New product forecasting via analogs to similar SKUs by
      style/material/brand/price band and attribute embeddings
    - >-
      Safety stock and reorder point optimization targeting service levels
      (e.g., 95–98%) with lead-time variability and demand uncertainty
    - >-
      PO recommendations that auto-respect vendor MOQs, pack sizes, order
      windows, and open-to-buy budgets, with options to consolidate across
      stores
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate promotions, price changes, and delayed
      shipments to see inventory and service-level impact
    - >-
      Assortment and allocation: recommend store clusters and optimal
      breadth/depth by location and channel
    - >-
      Exception-based workflow: alerts for at-risk items, delayed shipments, and
      forecast bias; Slack/email notifications
    - >-
      PO execution: generate EDI 850/Order CSV for ERP/EDI providers;
      vendor-specific templates and calendars
    - >-
      Vendor scorecards: lead-time adherence, fill rates, and return rates by
      vendor and style
    - >-
      Explainability and audit: show drivers of forecasts (seasonal index,
      trend, events), backtests (MAPE/WMAPE), and change logs for overrides
    - >-
      ROI dashboards: stockout reduction, GMROI improvement, inventory turns,
      and planner time saved
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase in-stock rate by 5–10 points and reduce inventory 10–20% within 2–3
    replenishment cycles by automating SKU/location forecasts and vendor-aware
    PO creation that accounts for seasonality, lead times, MOQs, and budget
    constraints—backed by explainable AI and turnkey integrations to retail
    systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category depth: proprietary vendor constraint templates and lead-time priors
    for luggage/leather goods; cold-start analog library trained on
    style/material/price attributes; travel- and holiday-aware external signals.
    Execution advantage: prebuilt integrations to common retail stacks and EDI,
    explainable AI with domain-specific KPIs, and pilot methodology that proves
    ROI within 90 days. Network effects from privacy-preserving benchmarks
    (accuracy, vendor performance) improve recommendations over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Inventory/buying manager at a luggage and leather goods retailer who wants
    clear, SKU-level buy/rebuy guidance so the right items are in stock without
    tying up cash.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile travel demand, long vendor lead times, MOQs, seasonality,
    and vendor constraints make ordering risky.

    Internal: Spreadsheets and gut feel create anxiety about stockouts,
    markdowns, and missed OTB.

    Philosophical: Buying shouldn’t be a guessing game—retailers deserve
    forecasts as precise as their sales goals.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of committing POs under uncertainty and missing
    vendor windows. Our team builds retail forecasting and replenishment
    tooling; the Copilot uses AI tuned to luggage/leather categories to forecast
    at SKU level and generate PO suggestions that respect seasonality, lead
    times, MOQs, case packs, and vendor calendars—explained with transparent
    assumptions.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect data (sales, inventory, vendors) securely and map SKUs.

    2) Calibrate: validate seasonality, lead times, MOQs, and service levels.

    3) Act: review weekly PO recommendations, approve/adjust, export to ERP.

    Agreement plan: clear ROI checkpoints, transparent math and override
    controls, data stays yours, and you can cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 4-week pilot focused on your top vendors/SKUs.

    Transitional: Request a sample forecast + PO pack built from your last 12
    months of data.
  success: >-
    Higher in-stock on A SKUs, fewer stockouts in peak travel, less excess on
    seasonal colors, smoother cash flow and OTB, faster turns, fewer rush
    POs/air freight, and hours saved each week on buying and replens.
  failure: >-
    Avoid empty shelves during peak, dead inventory in off-season, missed vendor
    windows, tied-up cash, steep markdowns, and constant firefighting with
    guesswork-driven orders.
