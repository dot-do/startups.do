  problem:
    - >-
      Newsrooms miss stories because manual beat monitoring is fragmented across
      city websites, agendas, dockets, FOIA portals, competitor sites, and
      social feeds; a single beat can require tracking 50–200 sources daily,
      which is impractical without automation.
    - >-
      Generic alerting tools produce high noise and low precision; editors
      receive hundreds of alerts daily with poor beat-specific relevance,
      leading to alert fatigue and missed high-value items.
    - >-
      Speed matters; many alerts fire only after a competitor publishes, not
      when an issue first appears on an agenda, docket, or filing, reducing the
      chance to be first to publish.
    - >-
      Shrinking headcount forces reporters to spend 5–10 hours/week on
      monitoring and triage instead of reporting; onboarding new reporters to a
      beat takes weeks because institutional source lists and heuristics are not
      captured.
    - >-
      Leads are not prioritized or assignable; there is no closed-loop from
      alert to assignment to story, making it hard to measure impact and improve
      signal quality.
    - >-
      AI adoption risk: editors need transparent citations and verifiable
      evidence to trust AI-summarized leads; hallucinations or misattribution
      are unacceptable in a newsroom setting.
    - >-
      Existing tools are expensive, PR-centric, or social-virality focused; few
      integrate tightly with newsroom CMS/Slack or support hyperlocal/municipal
      sources at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Beat coverage builder: ingest municipal agendas, meeting minutes, RFPs,
      budgets, permits, inspections, court dockets (via authorized providers),
      SEC/EDGAR, state/regulatory filings, press releases, competitor sites,
      social/public posts, FOIA portals, and newsroom-specific custom sources.
    - >-
      Newsworthiness ranking model tuned per beat and locality; scores (0–100)
      based on novelty, impact, timeliness, and outlet priorities.
      De-duplication and clustering across sources.
    - >-
      Evidence-first summaries: concise briefs (100–200 words) with links,
      timestamps, and quoted snippets; risk flags (e.g., legal, public safety,
      fiscal impact).
    - >-
      Suggested next steps: assignable checklists (who to call, data to request,
      documents to pull), contact suggestions (from your internal rolodex/CRM),
      deadline recommendations, and suggested headline angles.
    - >-
      Alerting and triage: Slack channels by beat, email digests by shift,
      mobile push; adjustable thresholds and quiet hours; per-desk daily Top 10
      leads.
    - >-
      Assignment workflow: one-click assignment to a reporter; auto-create story
      stub/assignment in CMS; track status (accepted, in progress, published);
      generate a trail from signal to story.
    - >-
      Learning loop: reporters rate relevance and outcomes; model retrains on
      your newsroom’s preferences; coverage gaps are auto-suggested based on
      historical stories and competitor coverage.
    - >-
      Compliance and trust: citations for every claim, hallucination guards
      (extractive summaries with exact quotes), source provenance, audit logs,
      PII/redaction controls.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboards showing time saved, accepted leads, conversion to
      stories, time-to-publish vs. competitors, and desk/beat performance.
    - >-
      Integrations: Slack/Teams, major newsroom CMSs (e.g., Arc, TownNews/BLOX,
      Naviga, WordPress VIP), email, SSO/SCIM, data vendors (press wires, docket
      providers).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss a beat: AI that continuously monitors your local sources, ranks
    and summarizes leads with evidence and suggested next steps, integrated into
    Slack and your CMS—so you file first, cut monitoring time by ~50%, and
    increase scoop rate and story volume from the same staff.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of beat-specific training data linked to
    outcomes (which leads produced assignable stories and scoops) plus tight
    workflow integrations (Slack/Teams and CMS) and a newsroom feedback loop
    that custom-tunes rankings per client. This compounding dataset and embedded
    workflow make replication by generic monitoring tools difficult.
