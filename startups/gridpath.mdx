leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Most mid-to-large shippers rely on static Excel/heuristic approaches that
      miss 5–15% savings in total landed cost due to inability to explore
      thousands of scenarios under service-time constraints.
    - >-
      Legacy network design tools require scarce specialists, long project
      cycles (3–6 months), and heavy data prep—making quarterly or event-driven
      redesigns impractical.
    - >-
      Service-time promises (e.g., 95% within 2-day ground) are frequently
      violated because models simplify real road networks, drivers’
      hours-of-service, time windows, and carrier capacity realities.
    - >-
      Demand volatility, seasonality, and promotional spikes are poorly
      handled—leading to suboptimal location and capacity choices and excess
      safety stock.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/WMS/TMS/OMS/Snowflake slows modeling and
      introduces accuracy gaps; governance/auditing of assumptions is weak.
    - >-
      Change management is risky: decision-makers lack transparent, auditable
      rationale to get finance and operations buy-in for capex or DC
      reconfiguration.
    - >-
      Consulting-led projects are expensive ($200k+), one-off, and don’t build
      internal capability for continuous optimization.
    - >-
      Sustainability and Scope 3 goals are difficult to factor alongside cost
      and service without credible emissions modeling.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a turnkey data pipeline: map customer, order, product, facility,
      carrier, and cost data from ERP/WMS/TMS/Snowflake via pre-built
      connectors; auto-validate and reconcile address geocoding and unit
      conversions.
    - >-
      Build a baseline network twin: replicate current DCs, transportation
      modes, inventory policies, and service-time SLAs; calibrate using recent
      6–18 months of order history.
    - >-
      Run multi-objective optimization: determine optimal number/location of
      DCs, capacity sizing, and customer allocation subject to service-time
      constraints (percentile-based), cost structures, and operational
      constraints (dock doors, shifts, HOS, carrier SLAs).
    - >-
      Scenario library and stress testing: compare mergers, new DC
      openings/closures, micro-fulfillment additions, carrier changes, demand
      growth, and disruption scenarios (port strike, fuel spikes) with
      sensitivity analyses.
    - >-
      Impact and implementation plan: quantify cost-to-serve by lane/SKU,
      payback period, capex/opex impacts, and a phased roll-out roadmap with
      change-management playbooks.
    - >-
      Continuous optimization cadence: quarterly refreshes and event-driven
      reruns; monitor KPIs and trigger alerts when service-time or cost deviates
      from thresholds.
    - >-
      GTM motion: 4–8 week pilot offering with guaranteed deliverables
      (baseline, ≥3 scenarios, board-ready deck); partner co-sell with boutique
      consultancies and 3PLs; publish benchmark insights for target verticals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, auditable AI-driven network design that identifies 5–15%
    logistics cost savings in 2–6 weeks while meeting explicit service-time
    targets (e.g., 95% of orders in ≤2 days), with one-click scenario stress
    tests and seamless ERP/WMS/TMS data integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A solver-plus-service model with verticalized scenario templates, audited
    assumption lineage, and an anonymized benchmark corpus that shortens pilots
    to weeks and provides board-ready justification. Combined with
    partner-embedded delivery, this enables repeatable, high-trust outcomes
    faster than generic tools or one-off consulting.
