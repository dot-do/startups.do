leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts on high-velocity SKUs and sizes cause 2–6% lost sales monthly
      for apparel retailers, especially during seasonal peaks.
    - >-
      Overstocks and mis-buys tie up 15–30% excess working capital; markdowns
      erode gross margin by 200–500 bps.
    - >-
      Planning is spreadsheet-based or ERP min/max driven, failing to capture
      variant-level (size/color) seasonality, promotions, weather, and trend
      shifts.
    - >-
      Vendors impose MOQs, pack sizes, long/variable lead times, and allocation
      constraints that planners manually juggle, leading to late or suboptimal
      POs.
    - >-
      New SKU ‘cold-start’ forecasting is weak; retailers guess initial buys and
      size curves, risking misallocation.
    - >-
      Multi-store replenishment lacks automation; transfers and allocation are
      reactive, not predictive.
    - >-
      Planners spend 8–20 hours/week consolidating data from POS, ecom, and ERP;
      decisions are slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability and measurable accuracy prevents trust in automated
      reorder suggestions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from POS/ecom/ERP/WMS; daily pipelines harmonize
      sales, on-hand, in-transit, returns, promotions, catalogs, and vendor
      data.
    - >-
      Variant-level forecasting (SKU x store/channel) with seasonality,
      promotions, holidays, trend signals, and local weather; weekly and daily
      horizons, updated nightly.
    - >-
      Cold-start modeling using product attributes and imagery to map new SKUs
      to similar historical clusters; initial buy and size curves predicted with
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Reorder optimization that respects lead times, MOQs, pack sizes, budget
      caps, and vendor calendars; generates ranked PO suggestions with
      rationale.
    - >-
      Multi-store allocation and transfer recommendations to rebalance inventory
      before ordering more; target service-level driven safety stock.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate promotions, delivery delays, and budget
      constraints; compare outcomes on margin, stockouts, and DOH.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop approvals; edit suggestions and push approved POs via
      EDI/email/API; audit trail of decisions and outcomes.
    - >-
      Accuracy monitoring with backtests, live WAPE/MAPE by category, A/B
      holdouts; automatic model recalibration.
    - >-
      Vendor scorecards: lead time variability, fill-rate, and lateness impact
      on service level to inform negotiations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native demand forecasting and reorder agent built for apparel variants.
    We forecast at SKU x store x size/color with explainability, optimize POs
    under real vendor constraints, and free working capital while lifting
    service levels—implemented in 2–4 weeks with measurable ROI in the first
    season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific demand graph for apparel that fuses variant attributes and
    imagery with cross-retailer anonymized trend signals, enabling superior
    cold-start and size-curve prediction. Coupled with a large integration
    library and EDI-ready PO optimizer, this shortens time-to-value to weeks and
    sustains a widening data advantage as the network grows.
