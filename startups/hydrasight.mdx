  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden early faults (incipient cavitation, internal leakage, bearing wear)
      pass end-of-line (EOL) threshold tests, contributing to 0.5–2.0%
      early-life failures and costly warranty claims.
    - >-
      Conventional test limits (static thresholds, SPC) miss
      transient/condition-dependent anomalies visible in high-frequency
      pressure/flow/vibration data.
    - >-
      False rejects and retests increase scrap/rework by 10–30% on problematic
      lines; root cause is unclear due to fragmented data (PLC logs, DAQ files,
      paper travelers).
    - >-
      Test cycle times are longer than necessary due to conservative guard-bands
      added to compensate for uncertainty; throughput is constrained during
      peaks.
    - >-
      Engineering time is wasted (hours/test cell/week) diagnosing NFF issues
      and tuning limits; expertise is tribal and not captured systematically.
    - >-
      Model-based analytics tried internally stall due to lack of labeled data,
      MLOps, and integration with legacy PLC/SCADA/DAQ systems (OPC UA,
      EtherNet/IP, Modbus, NI TDMS).
    - >-
      Cross-plant variability (fixtures, stands, sensors) makes limits
      non-transferable; lessons learned at one site don’t propagate to others.
    - >-
      Development test data (R&D/DOEs) is underutilized; seeded-fault insights
      rarely translate to robust EOL detection rules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive data integration to existing EOL and development stands via
      OPC UA/EtherNet-IP/Modbus/TDMS connectors; edge agent streams time series
      securely.
    - >-
      Physics-informed feature extraction (e.g., pressure ripple harmonics,
      case-drain flow transients, AE burst energy, torque ripple) plus
      self-supervised anomaly models per product family.
    - >-
      Seeded-fault and historical label program to calibrate model thresholds
      and quantify detection/false-alarm tradeoffs before go-live.
    - >-
      On-stand inference with millisecond-latency scoring; pass/fail plus reason
      codes and explainability (top features, time-frequency signatures).
    - >-
      Operator and engineer dashboards with SPC overlays, trend drift detection,
      and test-recipe optimization guidance.
    - >-
      Continuous MLOps: drift monitoring, periodic re-training, versioning, and
      A/B evaluation to maintain performance across stands and plants.
    - >-
      APIs to write results back to MES/QMS and e-sign workflows; automatic
      CAR/PAR triggers for anomalies beyond risk thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Catch incipient cavitation, leakage, and bearing wear at the test stand
    using physics-informed AI that ingests your existing signals (pressure,
    flow, torque, vibration, acoustic emission). Reduce escapes and false
    rejects, shorten test cycles, and codify expert knowledge across
    plants—without replacing stands or sensors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, physics-informed dataset and feature library for fluid power
    signatures, enabling high recall at low false-alarm rates with
    explainability operators trust. Embedded at the edge with proven connectors
    and auditability that fits IATF/ISO workflows—hard to replicate by generic
    ML or single-OEM internal projects.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Manufacturing, quality, and test leaders at fluid power pump/motor OEMs
    (NAICS 333996) who must ship reliable units at scale from end-of-line and
    development test stands.
  problem: >-
    External: Early-stage faults (cavitation, leakage, bearing wear) hide in
    noisy test data, causing escapes, scrap, and delays. Internal: Pressure to
    hit yield and launch dates without risking quality. Philosophical: Test data
    should prevent field failures—not be a checkbox.
  guide: >-
    An AI diagnostics partner with fluid power and test-stand expertise; proven
    anomaly detection on your signals; integrates with existing DAQ/MES;
    privacy, validation, and clear pass/fail rationale built in.
  plan: >-
    1) Data readiness review (sample data + goals). 2) Train/validate models on
    historical runs; set thresholds, KPIs, and reports. 3) Pilot on one line;
    deploy real-time/batch alerts and dashboards; scale across products and
    sites.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute data audit. Transitional: Request a demo
    evaluation on your historical test data; start a 4-week pilot on one product
    line.
  success: >-
    Catch faults earlier, reduce scrap/rework and warranty exposure, raise
    first-pass yield, speed root-cause analysis, prove quality with auditable
    traceability, and maintain throughput without over-tightening specs.
  failure: >-
    Without this, defects slip to customers, warranty costs spike, launches
    slip, yields fall from blanket guard-banding, engineers drown in manual
    reviews, and brand trust erodes.
