  title: Test-Stand Anomaly Detection for Pumps/Motors
  description: >-
    Detect early faults (cavitation, leakage, bearing wear) from end-of-line and
    development test data.
  targetUsers:
    - Test engineering
    - Quality
    - R&D
  triggers:
    - New test run completed
    - Shift-end batch analysis
    - Threshold breach on live data
  inputs:
    - >-
      Time-series: pressure, flow, speed, torque, case-drain, temperature,
      vibration, noise
    - 'Test metadata: model, serial, oil type/temp, rig ID'
    - Golden limits and historical labeled runs
  steps:
    - Ingest data from historian/CSV
    - 'Engineer features (efficiency, ripple, leakage proxies, FFT/Cepstrum)'
    - Train/update anomaly and fault classifiers
    - Score live/batch runs and rank severity
    - Generate probable causes and checks
    - Notify via email/Teams and log to QMS
  tools:
    - Python/Pandas/NumPy
    - Scikit-learn/PyTorch
    - InfluxDB/TimescaleDB
    - OPC UA/MQTT client
    - Grafana/Power BI
    - QMS API
  outputs:
    - Flagged runs with severity and fault hypothesis
    - Trend dashboards by model/rig
    - Action list for technician
    - Weekly drift report
  pricingModel:
    - One-time setup + model training
    - Per-test-stand monthly subscription
    - Optional per-alert overage
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 8
    modelCapability: 8.5
    overall: 8.2
  risks:
    - Poor sensor quality or calibration drift
    - Label scarcity for supervised modes
    - False positives slowing throughput
    - Network/security access to historian
  dependencies:
    - Historian or file drop access (VPN)
    - Minimum sensor set and sampling rates

  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden early faults (incipient cavitation, internal leakage, bearing wear)
      pass end-of-line (EOL) threshold tests, contributing to 0.5–2.0%
      early-life failures and costly warranty claims.
    - >-
      Conventional test limits (static thresholds, SPC) miss
      transient/condition-dependent anomalies visible in high-frequency
      pressure/flow/vibration data.
    - >-
      False rejects and retests increase scrap/rework by 10–30% on problematic
      lines; root cause is unclear due to fragmented data (PLC logs, DAQ files,
      paper travelers).
    - >-
      Test cycle times are longer than necessary due to conservative guard-bands
      added to compensate for uncertainty; throughput is constrained during
      peaks.
    - >-
      Engineering time is wasted (hours/test cell/week) diagnosing NFF issues
      and tuning limits; expertise is tribal and not captured systematically.
    - >-
      Model-based analytics tried internally stall due to lack of labeled data,
      MLOps, and integration with legacy PLC/SCADA/DAQ systems (OPC UA,
      EtherNet/IP, Modbus, NI TDMS).
    - >-
      Cross-plant variability (fixtures, stands, sensors) makes limits
      non-transferable; lessons learned at one site don’t propagate to others.
    - >-
      Development test data (R&D/DOEs) is underutilized; seeded-fault insights
      rarely translate to robust EOL detection rules.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive data integration to existing EOL and development stands via
      OPC UA/EtherNet-IP/Modbus/TDMS connectors; edge agent streams time series
      securely.
    - >-
      Physics-informed feature extraction (e.g., pressure ripple harmonics,
      case-drain flow transients, AE burst energy, torque ripple) plus
      self-supervised anomaly models per product family.
    - >-
      Seeded-fault and historical label program to calibrate model thresholds
      and quantify detection/false-alarm tradeoffs before go-live.
    - >-
      On-stand inference with millisecond-latency scoring; pass/fail plus reason
      codes and explainability (top features, time-frequency signatures).
    - >-
      Operator and engineer dashboards with SPC overlays, trend drift detection,
      and test-recipe optimization guidance.
    - >-
      Continuous MLOps: drift monitoring, periodic re-training, versioning, and
      A/B evaluation to maintain performance across stands and plants.
    - >-
      APIs to write results back to MES/QMS and e-sign workflows; automatic
      CAR/PAR triggers for anomalies beyond risk thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Catch incipient cavitation, leakage, and bearing wear at the test stand
    using physics-informed AI that ingests your existing signals (pressure,
    flow, torque, vibration, acoustic emission). Reduce escapes and false
    rejects, shorten test cycles, and codify expert knowledge across
    plants—without replacing stands or sensors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, physics-informed dataset and feature library for fluid power
    signatures, enabling high recall at low false-alarm rates with
    explainability operators trust. Embedded at the edge with proven connectors
    and auditability that fits IATF/ISO workflows—hard to replicate by generic
    ML or single-OEM internal projects.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Manufacturing, quality, and test leaders at fluid power pump/motor OEMs
    (NAICS 333996) who must ship reliable units at scale from end-of-line and
    development test stands.
  problem: >-
    External: Early-stage faults (cavitation, leakage, bearing wear) hide in
    noisy test data, causing escapes, scrap, and delays. Internal: Pressure to
    hit yield and launch dates without risking quality. Philosophical: Test data
    should prevent field failures—not be a checkbox.
  guide: >-
    An AI diagnostics partner with fluid power and test-stand expertise; proven
    anomaly detection on your signals; integrates with existing DAQ/MES;
    privacy, validation, and clear pass/fail rationale built in.
  plan: >-
    1) Data readiness review (sample data + goals). 2) Train/validate models on
    historical runs; set thresholds, KPIs, and reports. 3) Pilot on one line;
    deploy real-time/batch alerts and dashboards; scale across products and
    sites.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute data audit. Transitional: Request a demo
    evaluation on your historical test data; start a 4-week pilot on one product
    line.
  success: >-
    Catch faults earlier, reduce scrap/rework and warranty exposure, raise
    first-pass yield, speed root-cause analysis, prove quality with auditable
    traceability, and maintain throughput without over-tightening specs.
  failure: >-
    Without this, defects slip to customers, warranty costs spike, launches
    slip, yields fall from blanket guard-banding, engineers drown in manual
    reviews, and brand trust erodes.

      Detect cavitation, leakage, and bearing wear in end‑of‑line and
      development tests. Built for Fluid Power Pump & Motor Manufacturing (NAICS
      333996).
    ctaText: Start a 4‑week pilot
    ctaHref: /pilot
  problem:
    - 'Limits-based checks miss subtle, multivariate faults.'
    - Noisy stands and variable test profiles hide early cavitation and leakage.
    - Manual waveform review slows throughput and depends on scarce experts.

    - 'Test data is archived, not learned from.'
    - Scaling detection across part numbers and recipes is hard.
  solution:
    - >-
      Learn healthy signatures per model and test recipe to flag deviations
      early.
    - 'Monitor pressure, flow, temperature, vibration, and current in real time.'
    - >-

      severity scores.
    - >-
      Explainability highlights channels, time ranges, and operating points
      behind alerts.
    - >-
      Plug into existing stands: OPC UA, NI/TDMS, PLC tags, CSV—streaming or
      batch.
    - Deploy on‑prem or in your VPC; IT/OT‑friendly and offline capable.
  features:
    - >-
      Domain analytics for fluid power: order tracking, spectral kurtosis,
      cavitation indices, pressure ripple.
    - >-
      Auto‑baseline per part family and recipe; adapts to ambient and oil
      temperature.
    - Golden‑unit and population comparison with drift monitoring.
    - 'Pass/fail with reasons, severity, and recommended next checks.'
    - Operator dashboard and engineer deep‑dive; one‑click test report export.
    - APIs and OPC UA outputs to MES/ERP/QMS; full traceability and audit trail.
    - 'Handles ramps, steady‑state holds, and endurance cycles.'
    - Edge agents for Windows/Linux; low‑latency inference; GPU optional.
    - 'Role‑based access, SSO, and on‑prem data retention.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect your test data (OPC UA/PLC, NI TDMS, CSV).'
    - Import 20–50 healthy runs per recipe to train baselines.
    - Validate with known faults; tune thresholds and alerts.
    - Deploy to EOL and development stands; stream pass/fail + severity to MES.
    - >-
      Monitor drift and model health; approve auto‑retraining as populations
      evolve.
    - Scale across lines and sites with templates and versioning.
