  title: Crew Duty & Legality Checker
  description: >-
    Computes FDP/duty/rest legality under operator’s rules (Part 135/EASA/OTAR),
    flags conflicts, and proposes crew swaps.
  targetUsers:
    - Ops/dispatch
    - Chief pilots
    - Schedulers
  triggers:
    - New trip added/changed
    - Crew sick/aircraft swap
    - Daily legality sweep
  inputs:
    - Planned itinerary with ETDs/ETAs (UTC)
    - 'Crew rosters, qualifications, bases'
    - Regulatory rule set and company variations
    - 'Hotel/rest info, positioning segments'
  steps:
    - Normalize schedule and timezones
    - Apply configured rule engine to compute FDP/ rest
    - Detect violations and fatigue risks
    - Generate swap/split-duty/standby options with impact
    - Notify scheduler and update roster
  tools:
    - Custom rule engine
    - TimezoneDB
    - 'Scheduling/roster API (Leon, ForeFlight Dispatch, FL3XX, or CSV)'
    - Slack/Teams/Email
  outputs:
    - Legality report per crew/leg
    - Conflict list with recommended fixes
    - Updated roster export (CSV/ICS)
  pricingModel:
    - Per-aircraft or per-crew monthly
    - Setup fee for rules configuration

  risks:
    - Misinterpreting company-specific variations
    - Timezone/UTC mistakes

  problem:
    - >-
      Ops controllers and chief pilots at nonscheduled operators (Part
      135/EASA/OTAR) must compute complex, variable flight and duty time
      limitations (FTL) amid pop-up trips, medevac callouts, weather delays, and
      crew constraints.
    - >-
      Manual duty/rest checks using spreadsheets or basic scheduling modules
      lead to missed infringements, late cancellations, and regulatory findings.
    - >-
      Existing tools often lack operator-specific approved variations (FTL
      schemes), real-time recompute during disruptions, and actionable
      suggestions (who to swap, where to ferry, when to delay).
    - >-
      Crew utilization is suboptimal because legality checks don’t consider
      currency, training expiries, medical validity, basing, and positioning
      time in one view.
    - >-
      Audit readiness is painful: proving legality requires collating logs
      across systems; operators risk findings and fines due to incomplete
      evidence trails.
  solution:
    - >-
      Configurable rule packs for Part 135, EASA ORO.FTL (incl. variations), and
      OTAR with a rule-compiler that encodes operator-specific approvals and
      exemptions.
    - >-
      Real-time legality computation (FDP, duty, rest, cumulative limits) on
      each schedule change, disruption, or what-if scenario; results available
      in <2 seconds via UI and API.
    - >-
      Swap recommender that proposes compliant crew substitutions considering
      type ratings, currency, training expiries, base/positioning, visas, and
      minimum rest—ranked by operational cost and on-time probability.
    - >-
      What-if planning sandbox: simulate delays/diversions and see legality
      windows, buffer times, and recovery options instantly.
    - >-
      Integrated compliance evidence: immutable audit logs, rule versioning
      aligned to regulatory references, and one-click export for internal QA and
      regulator audits.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations with leading schedulers/EFBs; overnight batch
      and streaming webhooks to keep legality state synchronized.
    - >-
      Optional fatigue risk add-on (integration with FAID/SAFE/FAST) to layer
      fatigue scoring on top of pure legal minima.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI-driven legality engine purpose-built for nonscheduled ops that
    computes FTL legality to your approved scheme in real time, flags conflicts
    before they become findings, and proposes compliant, cost-aware crew
    swaps—validated against regulatory text and your Operations Manual, with
    audit-ready evidence at a click.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated rule DSL with clause-level traceability and a large, curated
    library of nonscheduled edge cases that competitors lack, producing provable
    accuracy and audit-ready evidence—combined with a swap optimizer tuned for
    irregular ops that balances legality, currency, and cost in real time.

    (NAICS 481219) who need every pop-up leg staffed legally and safely—without
    slowing the schedule.
  problem: >-
    Villain: shifting trip plans and fragmented regulations. External: complex
    FDP/duty/rest limits across Part 135, EASA, and OTAR plus company policies.
    Internal: anxiety about missing a constraint under time pressure.
    Philosophical: crews should fly rested and legal without spreadsheets or
    guesswork.

    built with ex–chief pilots and regulatory SMEs; logic mapped to
    135/EASA/OTAR; live rule updates, audit trails, and integrations—proven at
    charter/OCC scale.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect schedule and roster (API/CSV). 2) Configure operator rules,
    bases, acclimatization, and fatigue policies. 3) Get real-time FDP/duty/rest
    checks with conflict flags and AI-proposed crew swaps. 4) Export decisions
    and audit logs back to your system.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and start a 30-day pilot. Transitional: Download the
    legality checklist and mapping guide.
  success: >-
    Confident, compliant schedules; faster crew assignments; fewer
    cancellations; clean audits; reduced violation risk; rested crews; stronger
    client and insurer trust.
  failure: >-
    Missed limits cause violations, delays, fatigued crews, audit findings,
    reputational damage, and lost revenue from scrubbed flights.
