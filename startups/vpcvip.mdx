leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-value flyers (premium-cabin, top-tier elites, corporate influencers)
      face preventable friction during disruptions; manual, reactive VIP desks
      cannot scale, causing churn and revenue leakage.
    - >-
      Airline agents lack a single, real-time view spanning PSS/CRM/ops/loyalty,
      making policy-compliant exceptions and re-accommodation slow,
      inconsistent, and error-prone.
    - >-
      Disruption detection is often minutes to hours late relative to when
      alternatives are still available; by the time agents react, premium
      inventory and protected connections are gone.
    - >-
      Communication to VIPs is fragmented (call center, app, SMS, airport),
      leading to missed offers, low acceptance rates, and low perceived care.
    - >-
      Airlines struggle to quantify VIP experience outcomes (NPS, retention,
      spend) tied to recovery actions, making investment and prioritization
      difficult.
    - >-
      TMC VIP services are human-heavy and cost-intensive; they lack deep
      airline inventory control and cannot automate reaccommodation at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on monitoring of VIP itineraries with disruption risk scoring
      (weather/ATC, MCT misconnect risk, crew legality, aircraft swap,
      gate/IRROPS feeds, connection buffers).
    - >-
      Value-aware prioritization combining revenue contribution, loyalty tier,
      corporate account status, and trip criticality to sequence offers and
      allocate scarce premium inventory.
    - >-
      Auto-protect and propose policy-compliant alternatives (own-metal,
      alliance/interline, JV) with timed inventory holds; one-tap acceptance by
      the customer or agent with instant ticketing/SSR updates.
    - >-
      Dynamic waiver/exception engine for controlled policy overrides (MCT, fare
      rules, change fees, cabin upgrades, EMD issuance for hotels/meals) with
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Omnichannel orchestration: app push, SMS/WhatsApp, email, IVR callback;
      chooses channel based on customer preferences and regulatory consent;
      supports 1-click accept/decline and self-service options.
    - >-
      Agent console for airport/call center/NOC: unified VIP timeline,
      recommendations, what-if scenarios, explainability for each
      recommendation, and escalation playbooks.
    - >-
      Integrated ancillaries: lounge capacity-aware invitations, ground
      transport (e.g., car transfers for tight connections), hotel
      re-accommodation when stranded, and baggage reflight tracking where
      available.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop concierge for edge cases, with SLAs, playbooks, and
      secure payments for out-of-policy spend when pre-approved.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect, prioritize, and recover your most valuable flyers before they
    ask—policy-compliant, inventory-aware, and personalized. Target pilot
    outcomes: 60–80% faster reaccommodation for VIPs, +8–15 NPS uplift in the
    VIP cohort, and 10–20% lower per-case service recovery cost.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A value-aware, inventory-integrated decisioning stack purpose-built for
    airline VIPs combining early disruption signals, policy/waiver intelligence,
    and one-tap acceptance—backed by prebuilt PSS connectors and IRROPS
    playbooks that shorten time-to-value. Over time, a consortium-trained model
    on cross-carrier VIP interventions and outcomes (privacy-preserving)
    compounds performance and creates a defensible data moat.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Network and hybrid airlines with premium cabins and robust
      loyalty programs (10M+ annual passengers), ops and customer teams
      (NOC/IOC, customer care, airport, loyalty/CRM).
    - >-
      Secondary: Global TMCs and corporate travel programs seeking white-label
      VIP disruption recovery for top travelers.
    - >-
      Alliances/JVs/interline partners aiming to coordinate cross-carrier
      proactive reaccommodation for shared VIPs.
  channels:

      Loyalty/CRM, Digital Product) with ROI-based pilots.
    - >-
      Technology partnerships and marketplace listings with PSSs (e.g., Amadeus,
      Sabre, Navitaire) and SIs to shorten procurement/integration.

      cases handled.

      Festival/A4A events; thought-leadership content (case studies, benchmarks,

  character: >-
    Airline guest experience, loyalty, and irregular-ops leaders who must
