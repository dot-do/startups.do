  problem:
    - >-
      Pest/disease outbreaks in covered food crops (leafy greens, herbs,
      strawberries, specialty veg) are often detected late, leading to 3–10%
      yield loss and emergency sprays.
    - >-
      Scouting is labor-intensive (4–12 hours/week per hectare), inconsistent
      across shifts, and often skipped during peak periods due to labor
      shortages.
    - >-
      Current tools (manual logs, generic scouting apps) lack real-time
      detection, severity scoring, and risk-prioritized scouting routes.
    - >-
      Sticky traps and visual checks are underutilized; images aren’t
      systematically analyzed or linked to action thresholds.
    - >-
      Growers need defensible records for audits and retailers (GlobalG.A.P.,
      MRL compliance), but photo evidence and pest pressure maps are rarely
      captured.
    - >-
      IP cameras are widespread but not leveraged for plant-level anomaly
      detection in greenhouses/vertical farms.
  solution:
    - >-
      Smartphone-assisted scouting: Workers scan representative leaves/plants
      per bay; on-device CV pre-screens, cloud AI confirms, returns detection +
      severity + confidence within seconds.
    - >-
      IP camera analytics: RTSP streams analyzed periodically to detect
      hotspots, sticky trap counts, canopy anomalies, and spore-like patterns on
      leaves/structures.
    - >-
      Risk heatmaps and route optimization: Combine detections with climate data
      (RH, VPD), crop stage, and historical pressure to propose daily/weekly
      prioritized routes (zones with highest risk first).
    - >-
      Threshold-based alerts and playbooks: When detection exceeds set
      thresholds, trigger suggested biocontrol or cultural actions
      (non-prescriptive), with scheduling nudges and re-check windows.
    - >-
      Benchmarking and audit trail: Photo evidence, dates, severity indices, and
      outcomes compiled for internal QA and external audits; export to
      PDF/CSV/APIs.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: Grower feedback and expert-labeled images
      improve models per crop-pest pair; site-specific calibration over 2–4
      weeks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce crop loss and scouting labor by turning smartphone photos and
    inexpensive IP cameras into an AI scout that flags aphids, thrips,
    whiteflies, spider mites, powdery/downy mildew, and botrytis early,
    quantifies severity, and generates risk-prioritized scouting routes with
    auditable records.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, crop-specific dataset for under-cover systems (leafy greens,
    herbs, strawberries) with verified ground truth from sticky trap counts,
    biocontrol release logs, and climate data—feeding models that outperform
    generalized plant-disease apps. Paired with a route-optimization engine
    tuned to greenhouse workflows and partner distribution with leading
    biocontrol and climate-computer vendors.
