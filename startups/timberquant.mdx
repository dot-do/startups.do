  problem:
    - >-
      Manual takeoffs from PDF plans for prefab wood buildings are slow (2–8
      hours per project) and error-prone, delaying bids and constraining
      throughput.
    - >-
      Estimating accuracy varies by estimator and workload; quantity variance of
      8–15% vs actual purchase orders leads to margin erosion and rework.
    - >-
      Existing generic takeoff tools do not map quantities to
      manufacturer-specific BOM structures, SKUs, labor standards, or assemblies
      used in prefab plants.
    - >-
      Change orders and plan revisions require rework; teams lack fast version
      diffs and cost deltas, increasing cycle time and risk.
    - >-
      Estimating data is siloed; lessons from awarded jobs (as-built BOMs, PO
      costs, scrap rates) rarely close the loop to improve future estimates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated PDF plan ingestion and AI vision parsing to detect walls,
      panels, doors/windows, openings, framing members, sheathing, hardware
      callouts, annotations, and schedules.
    - >-
      Configurable assemblies and rules engine to translate detected elements
      into plant-specific BOM lines (SKU, unit, waste factor, labor standard,
      station routing).
    - >-
      Integrated cost engine with material price lists (vendor- or index-linked)
      and labor libraries to produce costed BOM and multi-scenario pricing
      (e.g., lumber grade or panel thickness swaps).
    - >-
      Version control and delta takeoff: instant diffs between plan revisions
      and change orders with cost/quantity variance.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI with confidence scoring; one-click corrections
      that retrain models on your data over time.
    - >-
      APIs/connectors to CAD/BIM and ERP/MES (e.g., Revit/Cadwork/hsbCAD/SEMA;
      MiTek/ERP; QuickBooks/Sage) for BOM sync and purchasing.
    - >-
      Analytics: estimate vs actual variance, win-rate by estimator/product
      line, top cost drivers, and scrap reduction opportunities.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native takeoff and cost estimation that turns PDF drawings into a costed,
    production-ready BOM in minutes—with configurable assemblies, SKU mapping to
    your ERP, and closed-loop learning from your actuals—so prefab wood
    manufacturers can bid faster, win more, and protect margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on manufacturer-specific assemblies, ERP SKUs, and
    actual cost data—improving estimation accuracy over time and creating a
    proprietary dataset and rules library that generic takeoff tools cannot
    replicate.
