  problem:
    - >-
      Small and mid-size specialty food retailers lack the time and expertise to
      create compliant, conversion-focused product content at SKU scale
      (100–10,000+ items).
    - >-
      Product content is often missing key elements (allergens, nutrition,
      storage, usage, pairings) and risks non-compliance with FDA/USDA/EU claims
      and allergen regulations.
    - >-
      Retailers struggle to rank on organic search due to weak metadata, thin
      content, and missing structured data; they lose traffic to marketplaces
      and larger grocers.
    - >-
      Manual content updates when suppliers change ingredients or packaging are
      slow and error-prone, causing outdated or inaccurate pages.
    - >-
      Cross-sell opportunities (pairings, recipes) are underutilized, limiting
      AOV and repeat purchase.
    - >-
      Ecom CMS publishing and version control across
      Shopify/BigCommerce/WooCommerce/PIMs is fragmented and not automated.
    - >-
      Limited analytics tie content changes to SEO and revenue outcomes, making
      ROI from content unclear.
  solution:
    - 'Ingest supplier catalogs (CSV, PDF, GS1/GTIN, APIs) and normalize data.'
    - >-
      Generate complete product pages: titles, bullets, long descriptions,
      usage/storage, allergens, nutrition, FAQs.
    - >-
      Create pairing notes (e.g., cheese + crackers + preserves) and shoppable
      bundles to lift AOV.
    - >-
      Generate recipe cards tied to SKUs with allergen filters and nutrition
      estimates; auto-link ingredients to inventory.
    - >-
      SEO optimization: page titles, meta descriptions, FAQs, image alt text,
      internal links, structured data (schema.org Product/FAQ/Breadcrumb).
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: prohibited claims filter, allergen detection/flags,
      Prop 65 warnings, transparent sourcing of claims with citations to
      supplier docs.
    - >-
      One-click publish and sync to
      Shopify/BigCommerce/WooCommerce/Akeneo/Contentful with versioning and
      rollback.
    - >-
      A/B testing of titles, descriptions, and metadata; track CTR, conversion,
      and revenue impact.
    - >-
      Multilingual generation (EN, ES, FR, DE, IT) with locale-specific
      compliance templates (e.g., EU FIC 1169).
    - >-
      Change monitoring: detect supplier updates and auto-refresh content with
      approvals workflow.
