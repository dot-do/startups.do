leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High reject volume: Typical community pharmacies see 10–15% first-pass
      claim rejections on 4,000–6,000 monthly prescriptions/store (400–900
      rejects/month).
    - >-
      Hidden labor cost: Techs/pharmacists spend 60–100 hours/month/store on
      reject troubleshooting and prior auths (PAs), at blended labor of
      $20–$55/hour.
    - >-
      Revenue leakage: 5–10% of rejected prescriptions are ultimately abandoned,
      driving lost dispensing margin and patient dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Complexity fragmentation: Hundreds of payer/PBM-specific rules, plan-level
      quirks, and drug/NDC-specific edit paths that change frequently.
    - >-
      Slow PA workflows: Manual, phone/fax-heavy PA initiation with incomplete
      clinical data creates multi-day delays and low approval rates.
    - >-
      Inconsistent resolution quality: Different staff interpret NCPDP reject
      codes variably (e.g., 70, 75, 76, 79, 88, M/I codes), causing multiple
      resubmissions and payer callbacks.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: Managers lack clear metrics on reject drivers, staff
      time, payer bottlenecks, and patient impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Realtime decoding of NCPDP reject codes with payer- and plan-specific,
      compliant fix suggestions.
    - >-
      One-click initiation of electronic PAs (ePA) with auto-populated clinical
      and claim context; guidance to achieve first-time approval.
    - >-
      Automated payer-compliant resubmission edits (e.g., DAW, DUR overrides
      where allowed, days’ supply splits, NDC swaps, refill timing).
    - >-
      BIN/PCN/Group-ID and formulary alternatives lookup with benefit-aware
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Resolution tracker: case management, SLAs, and escalations across rejects
      and PAs at patient/Rx/payer levels.
    - >-
      Knowledge engine: continuously updated payer policy graph (formularies,
      step therapy, QL, PA criteria) and reject-resolution playbooks.
    - >-
      Audit trail and documentation generation to support compliance and reduce
      payer callbacks.
    - >-
      Analytics and alerts: top reject drivers, payer scorecards,
      time-to-therapy, and abandonment risk prediction.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce claim-reject handling and prior authorization time by 50–70%, recover
    lost scripts, and improve payer-compliant first-pass resolution with an AI
    copilot embedded in pharmacy workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, de-identified dataset linking NCPDP reject codes + payer/plan +
    NDC to the exact steps that successfully resolved the issue, combined with
    tight PMS and ePA integrations and continuously updated payer policy
    graphs—creating a feedback loop competitors without workflow access cannot
    easily replicate.

    Pharmacy managers, pharmacists, and techs at drug retailers who want claims
    to pass the first time and patients on therapy faster.
  problem: >-
    External: Constant NCPDP reject codes, shifting payer rules, and PA
    bottlenecks stall fills. Internal: Frustration at the counter, time lost on
    calls/faxes, uncertainty about the next best step. Philosophical: Patients
    shouldn’t wait—and pharmacies shouldn’t lose revenue—because of opaque,
    fixable administrative hurdles.

    Empathy: We understand the grind of rejects, PAs, and callbacks during peak
    hours. Authority: AI tuned to NCPDP standards and payer guidance; built with
    HIPAA‑aligned safeguards, audit trails, and pharmacy workflow expertise.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Decode reject → plain‑English reason and impact; 2) Propose
    payer‑compliant fixes and required fields; 3) Auto‑initiate PA or generate a
    clean resubmission; 4) Track, nudge, and close the loop; 5) Sync
    documentation to your PMS/EHR. Agreement: Low‑risk pilot; simple integration
    (switch/PMS or web); role‑based access and logs; responsive support and
    clear SLAs.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo; Start a single‑store pilot. Transitional:
    Download the NCPDP reject cheat sheet; Use the ROI calculator; Read the
    quick‑start guide.
  success: >-
    Higher first‑pass approvals; faster time‑to‑therapy; fewer abandoned
    scripts; recovered reimbursements; shorter lines; happier staff and
    patients; clean, audit‑ready documentation.
  failure: >-
    More rejections and manual rework; lost fills and write‑offs; staff burnout;
    patient leakage to competitors; compliance exposure and audit risk.
