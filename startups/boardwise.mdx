  title: Script Breakdown and Stripboard Scheduling
  description: AI parses script to generate breakdown sheets and a draft shooting schedule.
  targetUsers:
    - Line producers
    - ADs/UPMs
    - Indie filmmakers
  triggers:
    - Script uploaded (PDF/FDX)
  inputs:
    - Script
    - Cast list and availability
    - Locations and constraints
    - Union/crew rules and rates (optional)
  steps:
    - 'Parse scenes, characters, props, SFX/VFX, wardrobe, locations'
    - Create element breakdowns and scene summaries
    - Estimate scene durations and complexity
    - Auto-generate stripboard and day-out-of-days
    - Draft schedule with constraints
    - Export to scheduling tools
  tools:
    - LLM NER/extraction
    - PDF/FDX parsers
    - Optimization/constraint solvers
    - CSV/Excel/FDX/XML exporters
  outputs:
    - Breakdown sheets (CSV/XLSX)
    - Stripboard PDF
    - Day-out-of-days
    - Schedule CSV/MM Scheduling XML
  pricingModel:
    - Per script page
    - 'Add-on: producer review session'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4.5
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Extraction errors from messy PDFs
    - Union/permit nuances not captured
    - Scheduling constraints change frequently
  dependencies:
    - Clean script or FDX
    - Availability windows
    - Location rules

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual script breakdown takes 20–60 hours per feature and is highly
      repetitive, delaying pre‑production by 1–2 weeks
    - >-
      Revisions force producers/ADs to re‑tag and re‑balance schedules
      repeatedly, creating version control headaches and mistakes
    - >-
      Inconsistent tagging standards across teams cause budget and scheduling
      errors (missed props, stunts, SFX, animals, minors)
    - >-
      Existing tools are either manual-first or complex to set up; AI point
      tools lack production-grade exports and scheduling robustness
    - >-
      Scheduling optimization across constraints (cast availability, locations,
      day/night, company moves, turnarounds) is hard and changes frequently
    - >-
      Indies and small studios lack access to experienced line producers/1st ADs
      early, leading to costly misestimation
    - >-
      Fragmented workflow: scripts in FDX/PDF/Fountain, breakdown in
      spreadsheets, schedules in other apps, call sheets elsewhere
    - >-
      Lack of measurable quality control leads to missed elements and downstream
      overages
    - >-
      Collaboration is clunky (emailing PDFs/Excel), causing merge conflicts and
      lost context
    - >-
      Security and IP concerns discourage teams from using generic AI tools
      without film-grade confidentiality and auditability
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest scripts (FDX, Fountain, PDF OCR) and auto‑tag all breakdown
      categories (cast, props, sets, wardrobe, makeup/hair, SFX/VFX, stunts,
      vehicles, animals, minors, extras, special equipment)
    - >-
      Generate a draft stripboard schedule optimized for cost/time with
      constraints (cast, location clusters, day/night, company moves, union
      turnarounds, minors’ hour limits)
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑loop review workspace to accept/edit tags and scheduling
      constraints with audit trails
    - >-
      One‑click exports to Movie Magic Scheduling, Gorilla, StudioBinder,
      Excel/CSV, and shareable PDFs
    - >-
      Change management: auto‑diff between script versions, carryover of
      confirmed tags, and schedule re‑balance
    - >-
      Collaboration: role‑based access (producer, AD, dept heads), comments,
      approvals, and version locking
    - Element reports and department breakdowns with counts and cost drivers
    - Calendar integration for cast/location availability and blackout dates
    - >-
      Risk flags (scenes with stunts, VFX, minors, nights, remote locations) and
      budget impact estimates
    - API and SSO for studio/enterprise workflows and vendor integrations
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From script to production board in minutes, not days: AI‑accelerated
    breakdown and cost‑aware stripboard scheduling with human‑in‑the‑loop QC,
    deep exports to your existing tools, and measurable accuracy guarantees.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of professionally verified breakdowns and
    real schedules across genres and budgets, combined with a film‑specific
    constraint engine and deep exports into incumbent tools—creating a data and
    workflow moat that new entrants and generic LLMs lack.
