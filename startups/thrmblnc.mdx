leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High and volatile energy costs: Fuel, steam, and electricity can account
      for 10–35% of OPEX in NAICS 324199 plants (calciners, asphalt blowers,
      dryers), with limited real-time visibility into unit-level energy
      intensity (MMBtu/ton).
    - >-
      Fragmented data: DCS/SCADA, PI historians, and spreadsheets do not
      automatically reconcile heat balances, causing 3–10% metering gaps and
      untrusted KPIs.
    - >-
      Operational drift: Fouling, insulation degradation, air leaks, and
      off-spec feed drive 5–15% avoidable energy losses that go undetected for
      weeks.
    - >-
      Limited prescriptive guidance: Operators receive alarms but no quantified,
      ranked actions (with expected savings and risk trade-offs) to optimize
      steam headers, fired heaters, and dryers.
    - >-
      Compliance and ESG pressure: Plants must report Scope 1/2 emissions and
      demonstrate energy efficiency improvements, but lack auditable M&V and
      unit-level attribution.
    - >-
      Change management friction: Energy projects stall due to lack of credible
      baselines, savings verification, and clear ROI, delaying approvals and
      incentive capture.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time heat/steam balance engine: Pulls OT data via OPC UA/PI,
      reconciles meters, infers unmeasured streams, and computes unit-level
      energy intensity (MMBtu/ton) every minute.
    - >-
      Prescriptive optimizer: Generates ranked, quantified actions (e.g., adjust
      O2 trim +0.3%, increase dryer inlet temp +5°F) with expected savings,
      constraint checks, and safety bounds.
    - >-
      Degradation and leak analytics: Detects fouling, air/steam leaks,
      insulation loss, and malfunctioning steam traps using pattern recognition
      and thermal models.
    - >-
      Steam network optimizer: Balances headers (HP/MP/LP), reduces PRV
      throttling, sequences boilers, and optimizes condensate return.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: Baseline models, weather and throughput normalization,
      IPMVP-compliant savings verification; exports to ESG/carbon systems.
    - >-
      Operator workflow: Shift-level recommendations, approval workflow, and A/B
      testing; change logs tied to performance deltas.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, reconciled heat and steam balance with AI-driven, operator-ready
    setpoint and maintenance recommendations that cut 5–15% fuel and 2–5%
    electricity within 90 days—verified under IPMVP and integrated with existing
    PI/DCS, without disrupting control logic.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, unit-specific heat balance and optimization library pre-tuned
    for calciners, asphalt blowers, and dryers, coupled with transfer learning
    across a fleet to benchmark and accelerate time-to-value; embedded IPMVP M&V
    with uncertainty quantification enables incentive capture and executive
    trust that generic EMS platforms cannot match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Energy, production, and reliability leaders in NAICS 324199 plants
    (petroleum coke calciners, asphalt blowing, dryers) who must cut energy cost
    and CO2 while protecting throughput and product specs.
  problem: >-
    External: Fuel, steam, and power are volatile and hard to reconcile across
    units; heat balances are manual, stale, and error-prone; losses hide in
    leaks, fouling, and bad controls. Internal: Teams are stretched and lack a
    single source of truth, creating firefighting and missed savings.
    Philosophical: It shouldn’t take weeks of spreadsheets to know where your
    heat is going and how to fix it.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run energy programs in heavy industry and know plant constraints. Our
    AI-driven heat balance engine, built by refinery/petrochem energy engineers,
    integrates with historians (e.g., PI/IP.21), DCS, meters, and lab data to
    deliver trustworthy, unit-level insights—securely and with IT/OT best
    practices.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely link historians, meters, and P&IDs; define units
    (calciners, asphalt blowers, dryers). 2) Baseline: Auto-build and reconcile
    heat balances; quantify fuel/steam/power intensity and losses. 3) Optimize:
    Get prioritized actions and setpoints; monitor results with M&V. Optional:
    6-week pilot, low-IT lift, no downtime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a demo and scope a 6-week pilot on one unit. Transitional:
    Request a sample heat balance and savings opportunity report for your
    process.
  success: >-
    See 3–10% reductions in fuel/steam intensity, verified by continuous M&V.
    Stabilize headers, catch leaks/fouling early, improve OEE, and document CO2
    reductions. Operators get clear setpoints and tips; managers get real-time
    energy KPIs and audit-ready reports.
  failure: >-
    Without it: persistent energy overuse, unbalanced steam headers, hidden
    leaks and fouling, missed CO2 and cost targets, spreadsheet-only visibility,
    and avoidable outages that erode margins.
