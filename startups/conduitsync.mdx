  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers spend hundreds of hours normalizing attributes, images, and
      spec sheets to fit each distributor’s proprietary schema (Grainger, Home
      Depot, Graybar, WESCO, Rexel), leading to slow time-to-market (often 4–12
      weeks per launch).
    - >-
      High distributor rejection rates (10–30%) due to missing ETIM/UNSPSC
      mapping, incomplete mandatory fields, or noncompliant assets cause rework
      cycles and lost sales windows.
    - >-
      Spec sheets are manually assembled in InDesign/Word, are error-prone, and
      become stale as engineering changes roll out; maintaining multi-language
      versions multiplies the effort and risk.
    - >-
      Translations lack electrical terminology accuracy, causing
      safety/compliance misunderstandings and increased returns and support
      tickets.
    - >-
      Distributors increasingly demand richer content (360 images, install
      videos, BIM/CAD, sustainability data), stretching internal PIM/DAM and
      technical documentation teams.
    - >-
      Fragmented pricing/packaging/variant hierarchies (MPN/GTIN/UPC) lead to
      duplicate listings and poor searchability on distributor sites.
    - >-
      Limited analytics—manufacturers cannot quantify content quality,
      acceptance rates, or sales lift by channel to prioritize SKU remediation.
    - >-
      Maintaining multiple one-off feeds (SFTP/API/Excel portals) is costly,
      brittle, and hard to audit for compliance (UL/CSA/CE/RoHS/REACH/Prop 65).
  solution:
    - >-
      Centralize product data and digital assets; auto-extract attributes from
      CAD/PRD/PDFs; map to ETIM/UNSPSC and each distributor’s schema using a
      wiring-device–tuned model.
    - >-
      Generate channel-ready titles, bullets, long descriptions, rich media
      tags, and compliant spec sheets styled to brand; auto-version
      multi-language outputs with electrical terminology controls.
    - >-
      Validate against mandatory field rules per channel; run compliance checks
      (UL file numbers, RoHS/REACH, Prop 65), packaging/variant normalization,
      and duplicate detection.
    - >-
      One-click syndication via prebuilt connectors (API/SFTP/portal upload) to
      priority distributors with delta feeds, audit logs, and automated error
      remediation loops.
    - >-
      Analytics layer measuring content completeness, rejection causes,
      time-to-publish, SKU coverage by channel, and revenue proxy metrics to
      prioritize fixes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native content engine purpose-built for electrical wiring devices that
    auto-generates, validates, translates, and syndicates distributor-compliant
    product content with an acceptance-rate guarantee and measurable lift in
    time-to-publish and channel coverage.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Electrical-specific AI models trained on millions of attribute-label pairs
    and acceptance outcomes across top distributors, plus prebuilt ETIM
    templates and compliance checks that generalist PIMs lack—combined with
    distributor-validated connectors and an acceptance-rate SLA that reduces
    risk for manufacturers.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Product, channel, and eCommerce managers at noncurrent-carrying wiring
    device manufacturers (NAICS 335932) who need distributor-ready, multilingual
    product content at scale.
  problem: >-
    External: Each distributor (e.g., Grainger, Home Depot) has unique schemas
    and content rules; manual mapping, translations, and spec sheet creation
    across thousands of SKUs is slow and error‑prone. Internal: Teams are
    stretched, missing line reviews and listing deadlines, straining sales
    relationships. Philosophical: Great, safe electrical products should be easy
    to find, specify, and buy in any market.
  guide: >-
    We understand how frustrating it is when quality wiring devices get buried
    by bad data. Our team blends electrical product expertise (UL/NEMA, IP
    ratings, RoHS/REACH) with AI/PIM skills; we map to distributor schemas
    (Grainger, Home Depot, Amazon Business, Graybar) and ETIM/NEMA taxonomies
    with human‑in‑the‑loop QA.
  plan: >-
    1) Audit & Map: Ingest PIM/ERP data, normalize SKUs, fill attribute gaps,
    and map to target schemas/taxonomies. 2) Enrich & Generate: Create optimized
    titles, bullets, attributes, marketing copy; auto-build branded spec sheets
    (PDF) and translations. 3) Validate, Syndicate & Monitor: Run rule checks,
    publish via API/SFTP/portals, track scorecards, and update deltas.
    Agreements: Pilot 50–200 SKUs; SLA on accuracy/compliance; secure data and
    approval workflow.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute content mapping audit; Start a 60‑day pilot
    with priority SKUs. Transitional: Download a distributor readiness checklist
    and sample spec sheet pack.
  success: >-
    Faster time‑to‑listing and higher compliance scores; complete, consistent
    specs and spec sheets across channels/languages; improved findability and
    conversion; fewer content rejections and chargebacks; sales teams equipped
    with accurate, on‑brand collateral.
  failure: >-
    Prolonged onboarding and missed line reviews; lost shelf space to
    competitors; inconsistent specs driving confusion, returns, and risk;
    ongoing rework, chargebacks, and stalled international expansion.
