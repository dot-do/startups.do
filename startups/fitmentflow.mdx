leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier product and fitment data arrives in inconsistent formats
      (CSV/Excel/PDF/XML/portals), causing 10–20 hours/month/supplier of manual
      mapping to ACES/PIES.
    - >-
      Time-to-listing is slow (2–6 weeks) due to normalization, validation, and
      approvals, delaying revenue on new lines and seasonal assortments.
    - >-
      Fitment and attribute errors drive returns and CS costs; 5–15% of returns
      in aftermarket eCommerce cite “doesn’t fit/received wrong part.”
    - >-
      Coverage gaps: long-tail and new model year fitment coverage often <70%,
      reducing search visibility and conversion.
    - >-
      ACES/PIES, PCdb/Qdb/PAdb, and Brand Table change frequently; internal
      teams struggle to keep up with schema/versioning and audit trails.
    - >-
      Pushing enriched content to PIMs (Akeneo/Salsify/etc.), eCommerce
      (Shopify/Magento/BigCommerce), and marketplaces (Amazon/eBay
      Motors/Walmart) requires brittle, custom connectors.
    - >-
      Duplicate, superseded, and interchange handling is inconsistent, leading
      to catalog bloat, listing suppression, and confusion.
    - >-
      Limited supplier feedback loops: retailers lack automated scorecards to
      improve upstream data quality, causing recurring issues.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion: connectors for SFTP/API/EDIFACT/Email/Portals; OCR
      for PDFs; schema discovery and column/field inference.
    - >-
      AI mapping engine: LLM + rules to map supplier attributes to ACES/PIES,
      PCdb categories, Qdb attributes, PAdb packages, and Brand Table validation
      with confidence scoring.
    - >-
      Fitment augmentation: generate/expand YMME fitments using pattern
      learning, cross-references, and compatibility rules; detect conflicts and
      supersessions.
    - >-
      QC/validation: syntactic (XML/JSON) and semantic validation against
      ACES/PIES versions; completeness scoring; duplicate detection; image/asset
      QA; hazmat/prop65 checks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: exceptions queue, confidence thresholds, bulk
      approvals, change logs, and audit trails for compliance.
    - >-
      Delivery: native connectors to
      Akeneo/Salsify/Pimberly/Magento/Shopify/BigCommerce/Amazon/eBay/Walmart;
      versioned deltas; rollback; sandbox vs prod.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: supplier scorecards, error reports, and shared corrections
      to improve upstream data.
    - >-
      Monitoring/Alerting: freshness SLAs, schema change alerts, and marketplace
      listing health (suppression/compatibility) dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy supplier feeds into ACES/PIES-compliant, high-converting product
    listings in hours, not weeks. AI-driven mapping + QC lifts coverage to >95%,
    cuts catalog ops costs 40–60%, reduces fitment-related returns 20–30%, and
    pushes clean data to your PIM and marketplaces with one click.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning “Fitment Graph” built from multi-supplier mappings,
    cross-references, and real-world marketplace feedback, combined with
    closed-loop QA and confidence-based automation. This proprietary dataset +
    connector network yields higher auto-map rates and faster time-to-live than
    generic PIMs or manual ops, and improves with each deployment.

    mapped millions of SKUs and enforce industry validations and marketplace
    rules.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect supplier feeds and PIM/ERP. 2) AI maps and enriches to ACES/PIES.
    3) Automated QC flags exceptions. 4) You approve changes. 5) We push clean
    data to your PIM and marketplaces.
