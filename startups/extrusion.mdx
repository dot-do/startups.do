  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 8
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Incomplete changeover data leading to infeasible plans

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers (polymer family, color, additive package,
      screw/barrel changes) drive 15–35% of available hours into non-productive
      time.
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets/whiteboards; rescheduling for hot orders
      causes 5–15% schedule churn and overtime.
    - >-
      Due-date adherence (OTIF) often <85% because of conflicting priorities, QC
      holds, and bottleneck lines.
    - >-
      Uneven load across lines leads to >20% utilization variance, starving some
      lines while overloading others.
    - >-
      Existing APS tools rarely model plastics-specific constraints (purge
      times, color families, feeder limits, regrind %, run-rate curve) leading
      to unrealistic schedules.
    - >-
      Frequent expedites and small campaigns increase scrap during purges by
      1–3% and energy costs by 3–8%.
    - >-
      Multi-plant visibility is limited; campaign planning and capacity promises
      to sales are guesswork.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across ERP/MES/LIMS/maintenance causes manual data prep
      consuming 4–8 hours per planner weekly.
  solution:
    - >-
      Purpose-built optimizer combining mixed-integer/constraint programming
      with heuristics tuned for extrusion compounding (sequence-dependent
      changeovers, purge/color families, screw/barrel setups, feeder limits).
    - >-
      Finite-capacity multi-line scheduler that respects due dates, QC hold
      buffers, maintenance windows, shifts, and materials availability.
    - >-
      Run-rate prediction model using historical jobs (polymer family, filler %,
      regrind, target properties) to improve duration estimates by 15–30%.
    - >-
      Campaigning engine to group compatible jobs (by polymer/color/additive
      family) to minimize purges and flushes while honoring delivery dates.
    - >-
      What-if scenario sandbox to simulate rush orders, maintenance, or formula
      changes; compare KPIs before/after.
    - >-
      Close-the-loop connectors to ERP/MES/LIMS for order status, actuals
      feedback, and automated dispatch lists.
    - >-
      Load leveling across lines and crews; energy-aware scheduling to avoid
      peak tariffs where applicable.
    - >-
      Rapid onboarding: data mapping templates for SAP, Infor, Epicor, Plex,
      NetSuite; initial results in 2–4 weeks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plastics-aware AI that cuts changeover time 25–40%, lifts OTIF to 95%+, and
    levels line utilization within ±10%, delivered as a 30-day plug-in to your
    ERP/MES with measurable ROI in one quarter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A plastics-specific optimization engine with learned setup matrices and
    run-rate models, plus prebuilt ERP/MES connectors and a growing anonymized
    dataset from compounding lines—enabling faster deployments and better
    schedules than generalist APS tools or spreadsheets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant schedulers and operations leaders at custom compounding facilities who
    must deliver on-time orders across multiple extrusion lines.
  problem: >-
    External:

    - Constant changeovers, color/material cleanouts, and dryer/feeder
    constraints kill throughput

    - Rush orders and competing priorities cause missed due dates and uneven
    line loading

    - Manual, spreadsheet-based scheduling fails to capture sequence-dependent
    setup times

    Internal:

    - Schedulers are overwhelmed and firefighting; nights/weekends are the norm

    - Leaders fear lost credibility with sales and customers due to unreliable
    promises

    Philosophical:

    - Modern compounding plants shouldn’t rely on guesswork—production schedules
    should be data-driven and dependable
  guide: >-
    Empathy:

    - We’ve lived the pain of campaign planning, QC holds, and
    sequence-dependent changeovers

    - We know every plant has unique constraints and tribal knowledge that must
    be respected

    Authority:

    - Built by ex-plant schedulers and optimization experts; validated in
    plastics manufacturing

    - Integrates with leading ERPs/MES (SAP, Infor, Plex, Epicor) and respects
    lot traceability

    - Documented results: fewer changeovers, higher OTD, leveled load, and
    reduced overtime
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect data: orders, routes, changeover matrices, constraints (dryers,
    QC, crews)

    2) Simulate and validate: run what-if scenarios and compare to historical
    performance

    3) Go live co-pilot: daily optimized schedule with human-in-the-loop
    adjustments

    4) Improve continuously: feedback learns plant rules; metrics dashboards
    track OTD, setups, and load leveling

    Agreement plan:

    - 4-week pilot with clear success criteria (OTD, changeover hours, schedule
    stability)

    - Keep your data private and secure; easy rollback; no long-term lock-in

  success: >-
    - 20–40% fewer changeovers via smart sequencing and campaigns

    - 95%+ on-time delivery with realistic, constraint-aware schedules

    - Leveled line loading that reduces overtime and burnout

    - Lower scrap and fewer contamination risks from better color/material
    sequencing

    - Faster promise dates and confident order-acceptance with accurate what-if
    planning

    - Schedulers regain time; plants meet commitments reliably
  failure: |-
    - Continued firefighting, missed due dates, and expediting costs
    - Overtime and burnout from lumpy schedules and late changes
    - Excess WIP, dirty changeovers, and capacity left idle on adjacent lines
    - Lost trust with sales and customers, and lost repeat business
