  problem:
    - >-
      Stuck/sluggish ferments are often detected late because cellar teams rely
      on periodic Brix/temperature spot-checks, clipboards, and simple threshold
      alarms.
    - >-
      Existing tank control systems raise alerts on absolute thresholds but miss
      pattern-based issues (rate-of-change slowdowns, atypical diurnal cycles,
      multi-sensor inconsistencies).
    - >-
      Data is siloed across SCADA/tank controllers, lab systems, and
      spreadsheets, making it hard to see fermentation risk holistically in real
      time.
    - >-
      Intervention playbooks are inconsistent across teams and vintages;
      knowledge is tribal and not codified nor data-driven.
    - >-
      Harvest labor is stretched; monitoring 50–500+ tanks manually leads to
      missed early warnings that would have been inexpensive to fix.
    - >-
      Quality and margin impacts from stuck ferments include costly restarts,
      increased VA risk, off-flavors, and devaluation of finished wine—yet
      impact is rarely quantified in time to justify proactive investment.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline: ingest tank telemetry (temperature, Brix/SG, CO2
      evolution), cap-management schedules, and lab data (YAN, pH, malic, VA,
      DO) into one live timeline per tank.
    - >-
      ML anomaly detection: model fermentation kinetics by
      variety/yeast/temperature regime and flag deviations using rate-of-change,
      shape analysis, and cross-sensor consistency (precision/recall targets
      defined below).
    - >-
      Actionable playbooks: suggest context-aware steps (e.g., temperature ramp,
      aeration/oxygenation, nutrient additions, re-inoculation workflow) with
      dosing calculators, checklists, and decision trees; log actions for
      traceability.
    - >-
      Smart notifications: role-based alerts via SMS/email/Slack with severity,
      cause likelihood, and next best actions; snooze/acknowledge with
      escalation paths.
    - >-
      What-if and guardrails: simulate effects of temperature changes or
      nutrient additions on kinetics; configurable to advise-only or closed-loop
      setpoint nudges where SCADA allows.
    - >-
      Works with low-instrumentation sites: manual/mobile entry and CSV lab
      uploads; optional plug-and-play retrofit sensors (through partners).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Catch slow/stuck ferments 24–72 hours earlier than manual processes and
    standard alarms, with data-backed, step-by-step intervention
    recommendations—reducing incident rate 30–50% and harvest firefighting while
    preserving wine quality.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of fermentation kinetics and interventions
    across wineries, vintages, and varieties—combined with validated,
    context-aware playbooks and tight integrations—yields earlier,
    higher-confidence warnings and practical next steps competitors cannot
    easily replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-size wineries (5,000–50,000 cases/year) with 20–150 tanks and partial
      instrumentation seeking better visibility and faster response.
    - >-
      Large wineries and custom crush facilities (50,000–5M+ cases/year) with
      150–1,000+ tanks, multiple sites, SCADA, and data teams—need scale and
      standardization.
    - >-
      Boutique/premium wineries (1,000–5,000 cases/year) with 5–20 tanks—less
      instrumentation; need a light package using manual/uploads and a few
      retrofit sensors.
    - >-
      Winery groups/multi-brand portfolios centralizing QA/QC and production
      analytics across sites.
    - >-
      Enology consultants and lab partners who advise multiple wineries and can
      drive adoption as influencers.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to head winemakers, production managers, and cellar masters
      via demos timed to pre-harvest (May–August in Northern Hemisphere; Nov–Jan
      in Southern Hemisphere).

      Alliances with tank control/SCADA vendors and retrofit sensor providers as
      co-selling partners and referral channels.

      marketplace listings and integrations.
    - >-

      Expo, Enoforum, Vinitech-Sifel; sponsor technical sessions and case
      studies.
