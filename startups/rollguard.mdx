  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of gearboxes, drives, and roll chocks cause production
      stops of 1–8 hours, costing an estimated $8k–$25k per hour in lost
      throughput, reheat energy waste, and overtime.
    - >-
      Route-based vibration audits (monthly/quarterly) miss early-stage defects
      and do not capture transient events like cobbles, overloads, and heat
      cycles.
    - >-
      Existing condition monitoring is generic; it doesn’t align predictions to
      the mill’s pass schedule, speed/torque profiles, or roll campaigns,
      leading to false alarms and mistrust.
    - >-
      Spare parts and maintenance planning lack remaining-life estimates,
      causing either premature component changes (2–10% excess spend) or
      stockouts.
    - >-
      Safety and quality risks (e.g., bearing seizure, roll chock overheating)
      can lead to scrap, near-misses, and regulatory scrutiny.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (SCADA/PLC, Level 2, historian, EAM), making it hard to
      quantify asset risk and tie alerts to work orders and production plans.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge+cloud service that ingests vibration (up to 25.6 kS/s), temperature,
      and motor current signatures, fused with Level 1/2 context (speed, torque,
      pass schedule, heat/coil IDs, roll campaign counters).
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML: order tracking, envelope demodulation, cepstrum,
      current signature analysis, and Bayesian RUL models with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Real-time asset health scores and event-aware anomaly detection (e.g.,
      overload spikes, chatter, misalignment, bearing defects).
    - >-
      Actionable outputs: defect type likelihood, RUL days, recommended actions,
      and spare parts needed; integration to SAP PM/Maximo for automatic work
      orders.
    - >-
      Operator-centric HMI/dashboard with traffic-light status per stand, shift
      reports, and production-aligned maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: on-prem edge-first with optional cloud
      analytics; IEC 62443-aligned hardening; read-only historian/PLC
      connectors.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict and prevent gearbox/drive/roll-chock failures with physics-informed
    AI tuned for rolling mills—reducing unplanned downtime by 30–50%, providing
    7–21 days early warning with RUL estimates (±20% error target), and aligning
    maintenance to roll campaigns to cut spare/inspection costs by 10–20%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specialized, event-contextual models for rolling mills (pass
    schedule/load/roll campaign aware) plus a growing cross-plant failure
    dataset enable earlier and more accurate predictions than general-purpose
    monitoring. OEM-aligned models and fixtures for roll chocks/stands reduce
    installation complexity and false alarms. Edge-first, low-latency analytics
    provide actionable insights even in air-gapped mills.

  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned drive or stand stoppages cascade into cobbles, yield loss, and
      overtime.
    - Bearing wear in roll chocks often stays hidden until catastrophic failure.
