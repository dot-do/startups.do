  title: Color Match & Costed Quote Agent
  description: >-

    costed quote from a target color and print context.
  targetUsers:
    - Color matching lab
    - Sales/CSR
    - Technical service
  triggers:
    - New RFQ with color target
    - Customer uploads CxF/L*a*b* values or Pantone
  inputs:
    - 'Target color (CxF, L*a*b*, Pantone)'
    - Substrate and ink system (solvent/UV/water)

    - Opacity/fastness/chemistry constraints
    - Existing base inks with spectral curves and costs
    - Lead time and MOQ rules
  steps:
    - Parse RFQ and validate required info

  problem:
    - >-
      Color matching and quoting are slow: typical cycle from target color to
      approved quote takes 1–3 days with 2–4 lab iterations.
    - >-
      First-pass match rates are inconsistent (often <50% within ΔE00 ≤ 1.5),
      leading to rework and delayed customer commitments.
    - >-
      Margin leakage: quotes often don’t reflect real-time raw material costs,
      inventory availability, loss factors, or compliance upcharges; pricing is
      inconsistent across reps and sites.
    - >-
      Expertise concentration: tacit knowledge lives with senior colorists;
      turnover creates risk and onboarding time for new staff.
    - >-
      Supply volatility: pigment substitutions and regulatory restrictions
      (e.g., EuPIA Exclusion Policy, Swiss Ordinance, brand-owner lists)
      complicate matches and re-formulations.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: formulation software, ERP costing, and spectro QC don’t
      talk to each other, creating manual data entry and errors.
    - >-
      Lost deals due to slow response: converters and brand owners expect
      same-day, costed quotes with documented tolerances and print context
      assumptions.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted, physics-informed formulation engine that proposes 1–3
      near-match recipes from a target color (LAB/spectral/Pantone) and print
      context (substrate, process, anilox/film weight, ink system).
    - >-
      Real-time predicted color error (ΔE00) under specified illuminant/observer
      and measurement conditions; confidence score; metamerism risk indicator.
    - >-
      Costed quote generation using BOM, current raw material costs, yield/loss
      factors, labor/overhead, packaging, and volume-based margin ladders;
      generates a customer-facing quote PDF and ERP-ready line items.
    - >-
      Inventory- and compliance-aware substitutes (pigment/binder swaps) that
      maintain color within tolerance while optimizing cost, lead time,
      VOC/low-migration targets, and restricted substance lists.
    - >-
      “Nearest stock color” and “use existing formula” suggestions to avoid
      unnecessary new developments.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest lab validation spectra and production deltas
      to improve future predictions; site-specific calibration and correction
      factors.
    - >-
      Seamless integrations to spectrophotometers, ERP/MES/PLM, and QC systems
      to eliminate re-keying and ensure traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From target color and print context to a near-match formulation, predicted
    ΔE00, and a costed, sales-ready quote in under 15 minutes—raising first-pass
    match rate to 80%+, cutting lab iterations by 50%, and protecting 1–2 margin
    points through inventory- and compliance-aware costing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A physics-informed ML engine calibrated to each site’s historical data and
    print context, coupled with real-time costing, inventory awareness, and
    compliance intelligence—delivering an end-to-end path from color target to
    price, which incumbent formulation tools and ERPs handle only in silos.
    Optional federated learning improves the core without exposing customer
    data.
