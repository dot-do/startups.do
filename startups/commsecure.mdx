  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering teams cannot reliably produce complete SBOMs for embedded
      firmware built with Yocto, Buildroot, vendor BSPs, and RTOS stacks. Manual
      or generic SCA tools miss 20-40 percent of components and produce
      inconsistent SPDX-CycloneDX outputs.
    - >-
      CVE matching for embedded packages is noisy. CPE mismatches, vendor
      backports, and private forks generate 30-60 percent false positives,
      delaying releases and creating audit friction.
    - >-
      License risk is opaque in vendor BSPs and prebuilt blobs. GPL/LGPL
      obligations (e.g., kernel modules, BusyBox) and notices are often
      incomplete, exposing the OEM to legal and customer penalties.
    - >-
      Crypto posture and secure boot chains are frequently misconfigured: weak
      keys or hash algorithms, unsigned bootloaders, outdated TLS libs,
      FIPS-ineligible crypto. These issues often escape code review and are only
      found in late-stage or field audits.
    - >-
      Customers and regulators now demand provable SBOMs plus VEX and continuous
      vulnerability monitoring. OEMs lack a standardized, repeatable way to
      deliver SBOM/VEX for each build and field release.
    - >-
      Post-release CVE monitoring and triage is ad hoc. New CVEs land weekly and
      OEMs cannot quickly assess exploitability per product/version without
      build-specific evidence.
    - >-
      Compliance evidence mapping to NTIA minimum elements, NIST SSDF, IEC
      62443, EU CRA, and CISA Secure-by-Design is labor intensive and scattered
      across teams.
    - >-
      Device portfolios are fragmented across multiple silicon platforms. Teams
      lack portfolio-wide visibility of shared components, creating duplicated
      effort and inconsistent risk handling.
  solution:
    - >-
      CI-integrated SBOM generation from source and binary artifacts that
      outputs SPDX 2.3 or CycloneDX 1.5, with reproducible build fingerprints.
    - >-
      AI-assisted component identification that maps binaries, vendor BSPs, and
      RTOS libraries to canonical packages and versions via a firmware knowledge
      graph; detects backports to suppress false positives.
    - >-
      Automated license discovery and obligations engine that assembles notices,
      flags copyleft triggers, and generates attribution bundles per product and
      release.
    - >-
      Crypto and secure-boot verification: validates boot chain-of-trust,
      certificate chains, hashing and key sizes, TLS stack configuration, FIPS
      140-3 algorithm usage, and weak/default credential detection.
    - >-
      Vulnerability correlation with EPSS and CISA KEV prioritization, plus
      machine-generated VEX (CycloneDX VEX or CSAF) that encodes exploitability
      reasoning tied to the specific build artifacts.
    - >-
      Continuous post-release monitoring that alerts when new CVEs or license
      issues affect any shipped build; provides patch set recommendations and
      minimal-diff backport options.
    - >-
      Compliance reporting pack that maps evidence to NTIA SBOM minimum
      elements, NIST SSDF, IEC 62443-4-1, EU CRA readiness, and customer
      questionnaires; exports auditor-ready PDFs and JSON.
    - >-
      Portfolio analytics that reveal shared components across product families,
      highlight systemic risks, and quantify MTTR and risk reduction over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-grade SBOMs and VEX in minutes from firmware or builds, cut
    false positives by 50-80 percent with AI-backed component and backport
    detection, and automatically verify crypto and secure-boot
    compliance—purpose-built for communications equipment OEMs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously enriched firmware knowledge graph and model set trained on
    thousands of communications-device firmware images and vendor BSPs, combined
    with prebuilt partnerships for BSP manifests and audit-ready compliance
    templates, enabling highly accurate component detection and VEX generation
    that generalist SCA tools cannot match.
