  problem:
    - >-
      Paper- and spreadsheet-based pre-departure checks, logbooks, and incident
      reporting are time-consuming (15–30 minutes per departure) and
      error-prone, leading to missed items and inconsistent records across
      vessels and crews.
    - >-
      Operators face fines, voyage delays, and reputational risk from incomplete
      or non-tamper-evident records and late CG-2692 submissions; electronic
      signature and recordkeeping requirements are poorly understood and
      inconsistently implemented.
    - >-
      Captains and deck crews often work offline or with poor connectivity; most
      tools are not offline-first, causing data loss and re-entry.
    - >-
      Each vessel’s COI and route create different checklist needs; generic EHS
      apps don’t adapt to 46 CFR Subchapter T/K specifics, causing checklist
      bloat or gaps.
    - >-
      Incident and near-miss narratives are hard to draft under time pressure;
      missing facts, wrong severity classification, or incorrect causal factors
      increase back-and-forth with company safety and local OCMI.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across paper logs, photos, emails, and texts makes audits,
      root-cause analysis, and trend reporting difficult and slow.
    - >-
      Standardizing practices across seasonal/part-time crews is hard; training
      and SOP adherence are not consistently measured or enforced.
  solution:
    - >-
      COI-aware pre-departure checklist engine that dynamically loads required
      items by vessel, route, weather, and season, with QR/label scanning for
      critical equipment verification.
    - >-
      Smart e-logbook with auto-capture of date/time/GPS, engine hours (via
      manual entry or API), crew and pax counts, and anomalies; creates
      immutable, tamper-evident entries with full audit trail.
    - >-
      AI-assisted incident and near-miss drafting: guided intake, severity
      classification, timeline builder, causal factor suggestions, and automatic
      population of CG-2692 fields for officer review.
    - >-
      Role-based e-signatures and approvals that align with USCG electronic
      recordkeeping principles (unique credentials, time-stamps, audit trail,
      retention, and export).
    - >-
      Offline-first mobile app (iOS/Android) with background sync; ensures
      uninterrupted operations in low-connectivity waterways.
    - >-
      Evidence capture: attach photos, videos, voice notes, and equipment scans;
      hash and time-stamp media for evidentiary integrity.
    - >-
      Dashboards for fleet compliance: completion rates by vessel/crew,
      late/missed items, near-miss trends, recurring defects, and training
      needs.
    - >-
      One-click export of records: human-readable PDFs, machine-readable
      JSON/CSV, and pre-packaged CG-2692 submissions with cover emails to local
      OCMI distribution lists.
    - >-
      Policy/SOP library mapped to checklists; micro-acknowledgements to confirm
      crew understanding and training traceability.
    - >-
      Alerts and nudges: pre-departure blockers for critical items, incident
      escalation paths, and reminders for recurring checks (e.g., monthly,
      quarterly).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn regulatory paperwork into a 5-minute, audit-ready workflow: COI-aware
    checklists, auto-filled logbooks, and AI-drafted CG-2692 reports that work
    offline, are e-signed, and meet USCG electronic recordkeeping guidance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A COI-specific checklist engine and AI incident drafter fine-tuned on US
    inland passenger operations, combined with audit-grade e-recordkeeping (WORM
    + time-stamps) and insurer-aligned KPIs that translate into premium
    credits—difficult for generic EHS tools or in-house solutions to replicate.
