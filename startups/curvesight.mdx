  problem:
    - >-
      Pump OEMs store decades of pump performance curves (Q-H/Q-P/Q-η) as PDFs,
      scans, and images, making them unusable by selection tools, PLM/ERP, and
      CPQ without manual re-entry.
    - >-
      Manual digitization is slow (8–15 minutes/curve), error-prone (2–5%
      transcription/scale errors), and inconsistent (units, axis scales, NPSH(R)
      handling, viscosity corrections), causing downstream design and quotation
      mistakes.
    - >-
      Validation of OEM curves against test-bench results is manual (30–60
      minutes/test), not standardized to ANSI/HI 14.6 or API 610 tolerances, and
      often skipped under time pressure, risking non-conforming shipments and
      warranty exposure.
    - >-
      Version control is weak; superseded curves remain in circulation, causing
      misquotes, rework, and non-conformances during audits (traceability gaps).
    - >-
      Engineering teams lack a system-of-record for pump curve data with audit
      trails, confidence scores, and change history compliant with ISO 9001 and
      API 610 QA expectations.
    - >-
      Integration friction: test-bench PLC/SCADA/DAQ data (e.g., PI, Ignition,
      Wonderware, LabVIEW) is siloed from engineering data; pump selection
      software and PLM cannot consume raw PDFs.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered curve extraction from PDFs/scans: detect axes, scales, units,
      legends; de-skew and digitize Q-H, Q-P, efficiency, NPSH(R) curves; output
      JSON/CSV.
    - >-
      Validation engine overlays test-bench data, computes tolerance bands (per
      ANSI/HI 14.6 acceptance grades, API 610 references), flags deviations, and
      generates pass/fail reports.
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop QA workflow for low-confidence
      fields; continuous learning from corrections.
    - >-
      Versioning and audit trails: immutable history, comparison of curve
      revisions, traceability to product codes/test IDs and standards acceptance
      class.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors to PLM (Teamcenter/Windchill/3DEXPERIENCE), ERP
      (SAP), selection software, DAQ/SCADA (Ignition, Wonderware), PI
      historians, and lab file formats (CSV, TDMS).
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS, private cloud VPC, or on-prem appliance
      for ITAR/export-controlled facilities.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From PDF to validated, standard-compliant pump performance data in minutes.
    CurveSight AI auto-extracts curves, normalizes units, validates against
    test-bench data to ANSI/HI 14.6/API 610 tolerances, and delivers API-ready
    datasets with confidence scores and an audit trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A standards-aware, domain-specific AI with a proprietary labeled dataset of
    pump curves and test runs, combined with integrated validation to ANSI/HI
    14.6/API 610 and production-grade connectors to PLM/ERP/selection tools.
    Human-in-the-loop corrections continuously retrain models, compounding
    accuracy and reducing manual touch over time. Early partnerships with
    test-bench and PLM vendors create switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Engineering, quality, and product teams at pump OEMs (measuring, dispensing,
    dosing, and industrial) who need accurate, machine-readable performance
    curves validated against real test data.
  problem: >-
    External: Curves are trapped in PDFs with inconsistent axes/units; manual
    digitization is slow and error-prone; test-bench drift hides deviations.
    Internal: Teams lack confidence in specs, waste time on rework, and risk
    late changes. Philosophical: Performance data should be trustworthy,
    traceable, and instantly usable across PLM/ERP and customer docs.
  guide: >-
    We understand pump testing and certification. Our computer-vision + physics
    models extract H-Q, P2, efficiency, and NPSHr from OEM PDFs, normalize by
    speed/viscosity, and cross-check with your bench results using ISO 9906/HI
    14.6 tolerances. Secure API and on-prem/VPC options; built with pump
    manufacturers for real-world workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload sample PDFs and test-bench exports (CSV). 2) We auto-extract and
    normalize curves, fit models, and validate vs. test data; deviations and
    root-cause hints are flagged. 3) Receive a clean dataset (JSON/CSV/API) with
    a validation report and dashboard; integrate to PLM/ERP and enable
    continuous lot-by-lot checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 20-minute demo to see your own curves digitized.
    Transitional: Start a pilot—send 25 PDFs + test files and get a validation
    report within 5 business days.
  success: >-
    Accurate, validated pump curves as a single source of truth; faster
    approvals and datasheets; automated conformity reports; fewer customer
    complaints and warranty claims; smoother audits; confident teams and happier
    OEM customers.
  failure: >-
    Continue shipping pumps with unverified performance, chasing inconsistencies
    across PDFs and spreadsheets; delays, rework, audit findings, and damaged
    trust.

  problem:
    - 'Manual curve digitization is slow, error-prone, and hard to scale.'
    - 'OEM PDFs are inconsistent in axes, units, speeds, and annotations.'
    - Scanned or low-quality drawings defeat standard OCR tools.
    - >-
      Test-bench data is hard to align with spec curves; deviations slip
      through.
    - >-
      Quality audits (ISO/API) demand traceable evidence you can’t produce
      quickly.
    - 'Late NCRs, rework, and warranty exposure increase costs.'
    - 'Legacy catalogs remain locked in PDFs, slowing quoting and engineering.'
  solution:
    - 'Extract H-Q, efficiency, power, and NPSHr curves from PDFs automatically.'
    - >-
      Normalize units, speed, viscosity, and duty points for apples-to-apples
      comparison.
    - Link curves to SKUs/BOMs and build a searchable spec database.

    - REST API and webhooks for automated workflows.
  steps:
    - Upload OEM PDFs or point to a repository.
    - 'AI extracts curves, axes, units, and metadata for quick review.'
    - Map to product codes and assign tolerance profiles by model/project.
    - Connect your test bench or upload result files.
