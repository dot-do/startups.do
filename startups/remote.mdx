leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High lead abandonment for trade-in forms (40–60% of customers drop when
      asked for long forms or multiple photo uploads).
    - >-
      Inconsistent remote appraisals across buyers/locations (+/‑10–15% variance
      vs. store appraisal), causing over-allowance and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Slow appraisal turnaround (often 24–72 hours) leads to lost deals to
      faster competitors and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Limited use of objective comps and condition-adjusted valuations;
      appraisals often rely on list prices or outdated book values.
    - >-
      Fraud/misrepresentation risk (old photos, hidden damage,
      odometer/generator hour misreporting, water/roof issues) increases
      wholesale losses.
    - >-
      Manual process is labor-heavy (texts/emails back and forth) and not
      captured in CRM/DMS for analytics or follow-up.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile web flow guides owners through 25–40 targeted photos and short
      video clips (roof, slide seals, undercarriage, water intrusion hot-spots,
      tires, generator hours, odometer). Average completion time 8–12 minutes.
    - >-
      Computer vision models score exterior/interior condition, detect common RV
      damage (water, delam, soft spots, roof seams, tire wear), and flag risk
      areas; outputs a 1–100 condition score and a reconditioning estimate
      range.
    - >-
      Pricing engine pulls book values (J.D. Power/NADA/Black Book) and local
      comps (RVTrader/RVT) filtered by
      year/make/model/trim/slideouts/mileage/options and recent sold/ask deltas.
    - >-
      Returns a branded, firm trade-in range with clear disclaimers and
      assumptions; captures customer consent and e-signatures. Dealer can
      auto-issue appointment links or request live video call backup.
    - >-
      Dealer dashboard centralizes appraisals, audit trail, comp snapshots,
      variance tracking vs. final ACV, and push to DMS/CRM. Role permissions
      enforce buyer approvals on high-risk units.
    - >-
      Fraud controls: EXIF/time/GPS checks, duplicate photo detection, VIN
      decode mismatch checks, and live selfie + vehicle photo step for liveness
      when risk score is high.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    White-label, guided remote appraisal that produces a defendable,
    condition-adjusted firm value range in minutes. Dealers convert more leads,
    reduce over-allowance by 5–15%, and standardize appraisals across
    rooftops—fully integrated with DMS/CRM and RV valuation/comps sources.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feedback loop powered by proprietary RV condition images linked to final
    ACV, reconditioning actuals, and resale outcomes across multiple rooftops
    and regions. This creates a continuously improving, defendable valuation
    model specific to RVs (roof/water/slide/undercarriage risks) that general
    auto solutions lack, coupled with tight DMS/marketplace integrations and
    buyer workflows tailored to RV operations.
