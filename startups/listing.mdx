  problem:
    - >-
      Agents and broker admins spend 3–6 hours per new listing assembling CMAs,
      writing remarks, building flyers, and keying data into MLS forms, creating
      inconsistent quality and missed deadlines.
    - >-
      Pricing guidance varies widely by agent skill and time available; poor
      comp selection or overpricing increases days on market and price cuts.
    - >-
      MLS data entry is error-prone and differs across 500+ MLSs; compliance
      violations (fair housing, claims, amenities) risk fines and listing
      delays.
    - >-
      Brokerages lack standardized branding and messaging across listings,
      weakening brand consistency and recruiting value propositions.
    - >-
      Existing tools are fragmented (CMA, copy, design, MLS) and don’t integrate
      into a single, auditable workflow for offices with multiple agents and
      coordinators.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven CMA with transparent comp selection, weighting, and adjustable
      strategy (aggressive/market/conservative).
    - >-
      Auto-generated MLS public/private remarks and photo brief aligned to
      brokerage tone and fair housing guidelines.
    - >-
      On-brand flyer and social-ready assets (print and digital) with
      auto-populated fields from MLS/public records.
    - >-
      MLS-ready draft mapped to local MLS fields, with validations and
      compliance checks; export via RESO payload or copy-paste friendly form.
    - >-
      Office workflow: intake form, role-based review/approval, version control,
      and audit trail.
    - >-
      Integrations: MLS data via RESO Web API, public records (ATTOM/CoreLogic),
      CRM/TMS (kvCORE, BoomTown, Follow Up Boss), and cloud drives.
    - Human-in-the-loop options for premium QA or complex properties.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
