leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and supervisors must manually
      reconcile sector demand with dynamic capacity using multiple disparate
      tools (TFMS/TSD, TBFM, STARS/ERAM strips, weather displays), leading to
      delayed or suboptimal TMIs.
    - >-
      2–8 hour look-ahead demand forecasts at the sector/position level are
      inconsistent or unavailable, causing late detection of overloads and
      reactive measures (ground stops, excessive MIT) that increase delay
      minutes.
    - >-
      Sector capacity is often modeled as static MAP values or rules of thumb
      and does not reflect real-time factors (weather impacts,
      staffing/sectorization, complexity), resulting in either overloads or
      underutilization.
    - >-
      Cross-facility coordination (TRACON–Center–ATCSCC) for flows and AFP
      participation decisions is time-consuming, with limited what-if capability
      to quantify tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Current tools lack prescriptive guidance; they surface data but do not
      quantify the expected impact of alternative TMIs on overload minutes,
      throughput, and delay, making decisions harder under time pressure.
    - >-
      There is limited auditability and learning-from-operations; rationale for
      TMIs and their measured outcomes are not captured in a reusable way for
      future situations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse SWIM/TFMS flight intent, ERAM/STARS tracks, TBFM schedules, and
      high-resolution weather to forecast sector entry/occupancy demand in
      15-minute bins for 2–8 hours.
    - >-
      Continuously estimate dynamic sector capacity using weather constraints,
      current/anticipated sectorization, staffing/position status, historical
      performance under similar conditions, and complexity indicators.
    - >-
      Detect projected overloads and rank prescriptive TMI options (MIT, route
      options, AFP participation, altitude capping, meters/slots) by expected
      reduction in overload minutes, induced delay, equity, and network
      spillover.
    - >-
      Provide fast what-if simulation to compare scenarios (e.g., 10 vs 20 MIT
      on flow X, alternate route Y, AFP join/opt-out) and visualize effects at
      sector, facility, and network levels.
    - >-
      Deliver explanations for recommendations (drivers, similar past days,
      confidence intervals) and capture outcomes for continuous learning and
      after-action review.
    - >-
      Integrate with existing ops tools (TFMS TSD, TBFM timelines, weather
      displays) and provide low-friction workflows for coordination messaging
      and CDM sharing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, explainable 2–8 hour sector-level demand–capacity balancing that
    recommends and quantifies the impact of TMIs—cutting overload minutes and
    unnecessary restrictions while accelerating coordination across facilities.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated prescriptive engine that quantifies the impact of TMIs at the
    sector level with explanations and confidence bounds, trained on multi-year
    paired traffic–weather–TMI outcomes and co-designed with TMCs. Deep
    integration with SWIM and ops tools plus a safety-governed,
    human-in-the-loop workflow creates switching costs and trust competitors
    lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Traffic Management Coordinators, Supervisors, and Flow Managers at
    ARTCC/TRACON/ATCSCC who must keep sectors safe and flowing while managing
    weather, staffing, and traffic variability.
  problem: >-
    - External: Rapidly shifting demand, weather reroutes, staffing/sector
    configurations, and NAS constraints create sector overload risk.

    - Internal: Fragmented data, short lead times, and coordination burden force
    reactive TMIs.

    - Philosophical: Safety and efficiency shouldn’t depend on
    guesswork—decisions should be proactive and data-driven.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure of minutes mattering, the scrutiny of
    every TMI, and the cost of both overload and over-restriction.

    - Authority: Built with air traffic operations SMEs; validated in shadow
    ops; leverages SWIM/TFMS-style feeds; integrates with existing traffic
    management workflows; human-in-the-loop by design.
  plan: |-
    - Process plan:
      1) Connect to traffic, weather, and staffing/configuration data.
      2) Predict sector/position demand vs. capacity for the next 2–8 hours.
      3) Flag overload windows and recommend advisory TMIs (MIT, reroutes, AFP participation).
      4) TMC reviews, adjusts, coordinates, and issues advisories.
      5) Monitor impact and auto-update recommendations as conditions change.
    - Agreement plan:
      - Human-in-the-loop approvals only; no automatic control actions.
      - Compliant data handling; audit trails for all recommendations.
      - Non-disruptive deployment; minimal training; reversible at any time.

    - Direct: Schedule a live demo and start a 30-day on-site evaluation.

    - Transitional: Download sample sector forecasts and a case study; get an
    ROI and staffing impact snapshot for your facility.
  success: >-
    - Fewer overload minutes and earlier, right-sized TMIs.

    - Higher controller safety margins and balanced workload.

    - Reduced coordination time; faster consensus with facilities and ATCSCC.

    - Measurable delay reduction and more predictable flows during weather and
    peak demand.

    - Transparent rationale for every advisory, improving trust and post-ops
    review.
  failure: >-
    - Continued reactive TMIs, last-minute restrictions, and sector saturation.

    - Increased controller fatigue and complexity; cascading delays across the
    NAS.

    - Missed opportunities to reroute or shape demand before constraints bite.

    - Limited visibility into what worked and why, repeating the same pain
    during the next event.
