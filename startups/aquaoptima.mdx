  problem:
    - >-
      Heat-driven demand spikes (e.g., 90°F+ weeks) create sudden out-of-stocks
      and retailer penalties due to static safety stocks and reorder points.
    - >-
      Promotions, display activity, and price changes are not systematically
      linked to inventory targets, causing either excess or shortages.
    - >-
      Raw-material lead times (PET preforms, caps, labels, shrink film, pallets,
      CO2 for sparkling) are long and variable; suppliers often change MOQs,
      constraining production.
    - >-
      Multi-plant, multi-DC networks suffer from imbalances (overstock in one
      node, shortages in another) due to siloed planning and manual transfers.
    - >-
      Working capital is tied up in finished goods and packaging buffers without
      clear service-level trade-offs.
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets or generic ERP min/max; limited ability to
      run scenarios (weather events, promotions, plant downtime).
    - >-
      Retailers expect OTIF >97% and consistent fill to maintain shelf space;
      penalties and lost shelf-space risk are material.
    - >-
      Co-packer and private-label complexity (customer-specific packs, labels)
      amplifies SKU proliferation and demand volatility.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with ERP/WMS/TMS (SAP S/4HANA/IBP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics,
      NetSuite) to ingest orders, shipments, inventory, lead times, BOMs,
      supplier data, and costs.
    - >-
      Demand sensing that incorporates temperature, humidity, seasonality,
      holidays, promotions, and price changes to forecast short- and mid-term
      demand by SKU-location-channel.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO) that sets service-level-driven
      safety stock and target DOS at plant and DC, accounting for transit,
      production, and supplier variability.
    - >-
      Raw-materials optimization that ties MIN/MAX for PET preforms, caps,
      labels, and film to the production plan, supplier MOQs, and lead-time
      distributions.
    - >-
      Automated recommendations for purchase orders and inter-facility transfers
      with constraints (truckload, shelf-life, capacities, carrier lanes).
    - >-
      Scenario planning (heat waves, promo uplifts, supplier disruption, plant
      downtime) with projected OTIF, inventory, and cost outcomes.
    - >-
      Exception management and workflow (approve, override, annotate) with audit
      and KPI impact tracking.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: model retraining on actuals, updated lead-time
      distributions, and supplier performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Raise OTIF to 97–99% while cutting finished-goods and packaging inventory
    15–25% in 90–120 days. AquaOptima AI sets dynamic safety stocks, reorder
    points, and target days-of-supply across plants and DCs—explicitly balancing
    service-level goals and working capital with weather- and promo-aware demand
    sensing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A beverage/water-specific optimization stack that fuses weather- and
    promo-aware demand sensing with multi-echelon inventory and raw-materials
    optimization, delivered with pre-built ERP connectors and supplier lead-time
    benchmarks—yielding faster time-to-value (8–12 weeks) and measurable,
    contract-backed ROI. Network effects from aggregated, anonymized performance
    baselines improve recommendations over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Supply chain and operations leaders at bottled water manufacturers who want
    to hit OTIF while freeing working capital by right‑sizing finished goods and
    raw materials across plants and DCs.
  problem: >-
    Volatile demand (heat‑wave spikes, promos), long and variable lead times,
    and siloed rules create stockouts and excess. Planners are stuck in
    spreadsheets and static min/max. You shouldn’t have to choose between
    service and cash.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run CPG planning at scale and built AI inventory engines used by
    beverage leaders. We understand summer surges and retailer penalties and
    bring proof: +2–5 pts service, −15–30% inventory, fast ERP integration, and
    SOC 2 security.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/WMS, demand, lead times, and BOMs. 2) Set service targets; AI
    computes safety stock, reorder points, and target days‑of‑supply by
    SKU/location/material. 3) Go live with weekly policy refresh, alerts, and
    planner overrides.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo. Transitional: Request a free inventory
    diagnostic and ROI model using your data.
  success: >-
    Balanced network inventory, higher OTIF with fewer expedites, 15–30% less
    working capital, smoother production runs, fewer penalties and lower CO2
    from rush freight, and payback in 90 days.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: stockouts during heat waves, obsolete packaging and aging
    materials, bloated warehouses, cash trapped on pallets, retailer fines,
    overtime, and costly expedited freight.
