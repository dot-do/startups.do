leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High sheet-goods waste (8–15%) from manual or simple guillotine patterns
      and inconsistent operator practices.
    - >-
      Linear lumber waste (3–7%) from non-optimized cutlists and ignoring
      remnants/defects.
    - >-
      1–3 hours of planner time per batch/job to build cut maps; bottlenecks
      delay production starts and cause overtime.
    - >-
      Remnant inventory is untracked or hard to reuse, leaving 1–3% additional
      material waste on the floor.
    - >-
      Frequent miscuts/rework from unclear labels and non-sequenced cut maps,
      driving 1–3% scrap and assembly delays.
    - >-
      Poor data flow from BIM/CAD/ERP to the floor (CSV/hand-entry), causing
      1–2% bill-of-materials errors and version control issues.
    - >-
      Volatile OSB/plywood pricing increases cost sensitivity; teams lack tools
      to simulate material substitutions and nesting trade-offs quickly.
    - >-
      Limited machine connectivity (TigerStop/RazorGage/routers/panel saws)
      causes manual transcription errors and lost time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud optimization engine for 2D sheets (OSB/plywood) and 1D lumber
      (studs/joists) with batch optimization across jobs, honoring
      grain/kerf/part priorities and guillotine vs. freeform constraints.
    - >-
      Automatic generation of cut maps, stacking/sequence plans, barcode/QR
      labels, and machine outputs (e.g., TigerStop lists, DXF/G-code for CNC
      routers, CSV for panel saws).
    - >-
      Remnant management with barcode tagging; dynamic reuse rules (min
      dimensions, age, material, quality) and auto-suggestion in future nests.
    - >-
      Defect-aware nesting using vision input (camera/Cognex/Keyence) or
      operator-marked defect zones; grain, veneer, face selection support.
    - >-
      One-click import from Revit/AutoCAD/DXF/CSV/ERP; BOM validation and
      version control to prevent floor errors.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: compare materials, kerf, batching windows, kit/build
      sequence; estimate cost/yield/throughput impacts instantly.
    - >-
      Operator tablet app for floor execution (map viewer, part verification,
      label printing, remnant scanning, exceptions logging).
    - >-
      Analytics: yield by job/material/operator, offcut reuse rate, cost per
      kit, CO2 saved from material reduction; automated weekly reports.
    - >-
      Edge agent for offline plants, syncs to cloud when connected; role-based
      access and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut waste, time, and headaches: AI-optimized 2D sheet nesting + 1D lumber
    cutting that turns BIM/CAD BOMs into machine-ready cut maps, labels, and
    G-code. Deliver 3–8% material savings, 50–80% planning time reduction, and
    payback in under 4 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound learning from cross-plant cut histories, defect maps, tool wear,
    and remnant utilization patterns enables better-than-human defaults and
    continuous yield gains; native connectors to common saw stops/routers and
    BIM (Revit) reduce friction competitors face. Early OEM certifications +
    case studies in NAICS 321992 create trust and a defensible partner moat.
