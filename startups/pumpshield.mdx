  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs in NAICS 333914 incur 1.5–2.5% of revenue in warranty costs due to
      preventable failures, slow triage, and misclassification of root causes.
    - >-
      Warranty claims and RMAs lack prioritization; high-risk units are not
      proactively flagged, leading to costly catastrophic failures and expedited
      shipping/service.
    - >-
      Failure modes (e.g., seal wear, cavitation, diaphragm rupture, bearing
      wear, motor overload) are inconsistently labeled across ERP/CMMS,
      degrading insights and driving repeat issues.
    - >-
      Limited connectivity and fragmented data (ERP, service logs, PLC/VFD data,
      IoT) impede predictive analytics; engineering and warranty teams rely on
      manual spreadsheet analysis.
    - >-
      No-fault-found (NFF) and abuse/misuse claims consume 10–20% of warranty
      budget due to poor pre-authorization screening and missing evidence
      trails.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: unify ERP warranty claims (SAP/Oracle), service logs
      (Salesforce/ServiceMax), EAM/CMMS (Maximo, Infor), and telemetry from
      VFD/PLC/IoT (OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT).
    - >-
      Risk ranking: daily/weekly risk scores per installed unit with lead time
      to failure (e.g., 7–45 days) and confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Failure-mode classification: supervised+physics-informed models map
      multivariate signals and claim text to a standardized pump failure
      taxonomy.
    - >-
      Prescriptions: action playbooks (e.g., flush suction strainer, adjust NPSH
      margin, recalibrate dosing rate, replace seal kit) prioritized by ROI and
      required parts/tools.
    - >-
      Warranty triage workflow: auto-route claims by risk and probable cause;
      pre-authorization checklist; fraud/abuse likelihood flag; recommended RMA
      vs. field fix.
    - >-
      Spare parts and schedule optimization: forecast parts demand for high-risk
      models; align technician schedules with predicted failures.
    - >-
      ROI reporting: warranty cost avoided, RMA reduction, NFF reduction,
      adherence to prescriptions, and model quality (precision/recall, lift over
      baseline).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce warranty cost 15–30% and accelerate service triage by 25–40% through
    pump-specific, physics-informed predictive risk scoring, automated
    failure-mode classification, and prescriptive actions integrated into
    ERP/EAM/CMMS workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical depth: a proprietary pump failure taxonomy, physics-informed
    models, and cross-manufacturer labeled datasets enable higher precision,
    earlier lead times, and actionable prescriptions tightly integrated into
    warranty workflows—capabilities generic APM/IoT platforms lack.
  customerSegments:

      Primary: OEM pump manufacturers (measuring, metering, dispensing, and
      other pumping equipment) with $100M–$2B revenue, global installed base
      >50,000 units, and warranty accrual >1.5% of revenue.
    - >-
      Secondary: OEM field service organizations and authorized service centers
      that handle RMAs and site repairs.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Warranty, service, and reliability leaders at manufacturers of measuring,
    dispensing, and other pumping equipment who must protect uptime, margin, and
    customer trust across a growing installed base.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned field failures, escalating warranty spend, and
    inefficient triage across thousands of units. Internal: Teams are flying
    blind—data is siloed, failure modes are unclear, and resources are
    misallocated. Philosophical: Preventable failures shouldn’t cost customers
    uptime or OEMs their reputation.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of warranty exposure and service firefighting.
    Our team blends OEM service experience with industrial AI, using your
    warranty, service, and telemetry data to rank risk, classify failure modes,
    and prescribe actions—so you intervene before failure.
  plan: >-
    Simple path: 1) Connect data (ERP/CRM/CMMS/telemetry); 2) Run risk scoring
    and failure‑mode classification per serial; 3) Publish prioritized,
    ROI‑ranked actions to your service workflow; 4) Close the loop with outcomes
    to continuously improve. Clear terms: secure data handling, fast pilot,
    success criteria agreed up front.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute installed‑base risk assessment or start a
    60‑day pilot on a product line. Transitional: Get a sample risk report, ROI
    model, and data readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Proactive service that lowers warranty cost, improves first‑time fix,
    stabilizes parts planning, reduces downtime, and increases customer
    loyalty—turning service from cost center into competitive advantage.
  failure: >-
    Status quo: rising claims, surprise field failures, emergency dispatches,
    parts stockouts or excess inventory, eroded margins, and lost customers.
