  problem:
    - >-
      Phantom inventory causes the system to show on-hand >0 while the shelf is
      empty, leading to lost sales and poor customer experience; manual cycle
      counts miss most issues.
    - >-
      Store teams waste labor counting low-risk items; cycle-count hit rates are
      often <25%, with little guidance on what to prioritize.
    - >-
      Perpetual inventory accuracy is typically 80–90% in large formats; even a
      5–10 point error drives significant OOS and shrink.
    - >-
      Existing replenishment and forecasting tools assume accurate on-hand; they
      underperform when inventory records are wrong.
    - >-
      Seasonal transitions and pallet/display resets in clubs create spikes in
      hidden OOS and mislocations not caught by standard processes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest POS sales, perpetual on-hand, receiving, transfers, planogram/shelf
      capacity, case-pack, promo, and seasonality signals.
    - >-
      Score each SKU-store-day for phantom inventory and OOS risk, with
      root-cause labels (mis-shelved, data error, shrink, display transition,
      late-received).
    - >-
      Auto-generate prioritized cycle count lists (e.g., top 200 risks per store
      per day) that maximize confirmed fixes per hour.
    - >-
      Mobile workflows for associates: verify, correct on-hand, trigger pulls,
      mark mislocations, and add notes/photos; all feedback retrains the model.
    - >-
      Exception dashboards for HQ: OOS hotspots, category rolls, promo at-risk
      items, labor impact, and saved sales attribution.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to handheld tasking (Zebra/Reflexis), WMS/OMS, and
      reporting (Power BI/Tableau).
    - >-
      Rapid pilot playbook: 10–20 stores in 2 weeks; A/B measurement with
      matched control stores; weekly savings readouts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Find what your systems say you have but customers can’t buy—and fix it
    today. PI-OOS ranks SKU-store risks daily, guides high-yield counts, and
    closes the loop to lift sales, cut labor, and improve inventory accuracy
    within 8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, cross-retailer anomaly library and feedback dataset that
    improves precision on hard-to-detect phantom cases; rapid pilot toolkit that
    delivers measurable ROI in weeks; deep integrations with handheld tasking to
    convert insights into verified fixes—creating a data moat competitors can’t
    easily replicate.

  character: >-
    Inventory, replenishment, and store ops leaders at warehouse clubs and
    supercenters who need accurate on-hand and shelf availability.
  problem: >-
    Phantom inventory and hidden out-of-stocks distort on-hand, trigger bad
    orders, waste cycle-count labor, and lose sales—without a fast, reliable way
    to know where to look first.
  guide: >-
    We understand the frustration of chasing bad counts and empty shelves. Our
    AI service analyzes POS and on-hand signals to detect phantom inventory and
    OOS risk, prioritizing what to count and fix—grounded in large-format retail
    and store-ops best practices.
  plan: >-
    Connect POS/on-hand/location data; receive a ranked store–item exception
    list with reasons and expected sales impact; action targeted cycle counts
    and quick fixes; monitor recovery and root causes to prevent repeats.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 4-week pilot on a subset of clubs/stores, or request a sample
    analysis using recent sales and on-hand data.
  success: >-
    Trustworthy on-hand, fewer OOS, recovered sales, smarter cycle counts,
    happier members, and better working capital—without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Keep bleeding sales to empty shelves, spend labor on low-impact counts,
    frustrate teams, and make bad replenishment decisions from bad data.
