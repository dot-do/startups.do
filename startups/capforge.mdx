    recommendations for metal, plastic, and assembly lines.
  targetUsers:
    - Supply Chain
    - Operations
    - Finance

    - Historical orders/shipments
    - Dealer POS/project pipeline
    - Promotion calendars
    - Lead times and min lot sizes
    - Capacity by workcenter
  steps:
    - >-
      Clean and map orders to SKUs/options; identify seasonality and
      cannibalization
    - Generate forecasts (baseline + promo/project overrides)
    - Run capacity-constrained plan to create feasible MPS/MRP
    - 'Scenario analysis (price swings, lead-time shocks)'

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High option/SKU variability causes poor forecasts at the option level;
      typical MAPE 30–45% and bias ±10–15%, leading to chronic misallocation of
      capacity and inventory.
    - >-
      Finite and changeover-heavy capacity on metal fabrication, powder coat,
      plastics molding, and assembly is not reflected in plans; Excel-based
      MPS/MRP cannot respect constraints, creating unstable schedules and
      firefighting.
    - >-
      OTIF is commonly 80–88% with frequent expediting; expedite freight often
      equals 1–3% of revenue and overtime adds 5–10% to direct labor cost in
      peak weeks.
    - >-
      Excess and obsolete inventory from option-level demand uncertainty;
      inventory turns 4–6 versus a target 8–10, tying up working capital.
    - >-
      MRP explosion ignores real-world supplier calendars/MOQs, causing late
      component shortages and hot-lot re-sequencing on the shop floor.
    - >-
      S&OP lacks visibility to quote/bid funnel and dealer programs;
      high-variance large orders (projects) are not scenario-planned, causing
      whiplash in capacity and materials.
    - >-
      Lead-time quoting is inconsistent; ATP/CTP is not capacity-aware,
      resulting in missed promise dates and margin-eroding concessions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP, MES, CRM, and spreadsheets slows decisions and
      hides root causes of lateness and variance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Probabilistic, option-level demand forecasting using order history, dealer
      programs, quote/bid pipeline, seasonality, and macro indicators; outputs
      weekly SKU-option distributions and bias diagnostics.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware planning: generates finite MPS/MRP that respects
      work-center calendars, changeovers, queue times, tooling, mold cavitation,
      powder coat color batching, and supplier MOQs/lead times.
    - >-
      Capacity smoothing and line balancing: automatically re-phases planned
      orders within promise windows to minimize peak loads and overtime while
      protecting critical due dates.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning: simulate large project wins/losses, promotions,
      supplier delays, and capacity changes; compare service, inventory, and
      cost trade-offs.
    - >-
      ATP/CTP with promise dates: capacity- and material-aware quoting
      integrated to CRM/CPQ; protects margins and reliability.
    - >-
      Closed-loop ERP/MES integration: push planned orders, purchase
      recommendations, and reschedules; pull confirmations, actuals, and scrap
      to continuously learn.
    - >-
      Rapid time-to-value playbook: 8–12 week onboarding per plant with data
      connectors, validation dashboards, and planner coaching.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI for office furniture (non-wood) that forecasts at
    SKU/option level and creates capacity-constrained MPS/MRP for metal,
    plastics, powder coat, and assembly—reducing expedites and overtime while
    lifting OTIF to 95%+ within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt, furniture-specific constraint and batching templates (powder coat
    color matrices, mold/tool libraries, metal fabrication routings) plus
    anonymized industry benchmarks and proven ERP connectors enable 90-day
    time-to-value that generalist APS/Demand tools struggle to match.

    and feasible, capacity‑constrained production plans.
  problem: >-
    Volatile, option-heavy demand overwhelms metal presses, plastic molding, and
    assembly lines. Planners juggle spreadsheets, changeovers, and long supplier
    lead times yet still face stockouts, WIP spikes, and missed dates. Planning
    shouldn’t be guesswork or chaos.

    We understand furniture-specific complexity and the cost of bad plans. Our
    category-trained AI forecasts at SKU/option level, respects routings and
    capacities, and integrates with your ERP/MES—bringing clarity with
    measurable accuracy and schedule stability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: orders, options/BOMs, routings, calendars, capacities; map
    metal, plastic, and assembly constraints. 2) Forecast & smooth:
    machine-learned SKU/option forecasts, capacity smoothing, and what-if
    scenarios by mix/promo/constraints. 3) Recommend & execute: constrained
    MPS/MRP, purchase/work orders, and shift/overtime guidance; weekly S&OP
    review; ERP integration. Assurances: security-first, transparent logic with
    planner overrides, 4–6 week pilot before scale.

    Direct: Book a 30‑minute planning assessment or start a 6‑week pilot.
    Transitional: Download a sample constrained MPS/MRP packet and ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Stable, realistic schedules; 95%+ on-time delivery; lower WIP and inventory;
    fewer expedites; predictable shifts and capacity buffers; faster promise
    dates; higher margins and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting—missed ship dates, premium freight, overtime
    whiplash, excess WIP and slow movers, lost revenue, and burned-out planners.
