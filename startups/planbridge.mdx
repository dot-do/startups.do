leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      IEP and 504 paperwork time burden: case managers spend 6–10 hours per
      student per annual cycle drafting PLAAFPs, goals, accommodations, notices,
      and agendas, reducing time for instruction and direct services.
    - >-
      Inconsistent document quality and compliance: goals often lack baselines
      or measurable criteria; accommodations are generic; missed deadlines risk
      corrective action, due process, and costly settlements (typical hearing
      costs $30k–$50k+).
    - >-
      Fragmented data: student performance data lives across SIS, IEP systems,
      assessment portals, therapy notes, and progress monitoring tools, making
      compilation manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Family communication gaps: documents are written at Grade 12+ reading
      levels; families need plain-language explanations and multilingual support
      to participate meaningfully.
    - >-
      Meeting inefficiency: agendas, roles, and pre-reads are ad hoc; meetings
      run long, miss key items, and produce unclear action items.
    - >-
      Staff turnover and onboarding: new case managers lack exemplars and
      validated goal banks; quality varies by campus and year.
    - >-
      Equity and consistency: 504 plans vary widely across schools for similar
      needs; districts struggle to ensure equitable supports and traceability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion layer to compile student progress across SIS, IEP
      platforms, assessment tools, and provider notes with consent and robust
      role-based access.
    - >-
      AI drafting workspace that generates PLAAFPs, SMART goals with baselines,
      accommodations/modifications, progress monitoring plans, and legally
      compliant notices aligned to district/state templates.
    - >-
      Family-friendly explanations and multilingual summaries at a target Grade
      6–8 reading level, including visuals and examples; auto-generated pre-read
      packets and meeting agendas tailored to student needs.
    - >-
      Meeting orchestration: agenda builder, roles/attendance, live note-taking,
      action items, and post-meeting minutes; optional real-time transcription
      with privacy controls.
    - >-
      Compliance and quality engine: checks for measurable criteria, service
      minutes alignment, LRE rationale prompts, procedural safeguards reminders,
      date tracking, and state-specific rule packs.
    - >-
      Collaboration and auditability: version history, acceptance tracking (what
      AI drafted vs human edits), reviewer workflows, and export into existing
      IEP/504 systems.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prepare compliant, family-friendly IEP/504 drafts and meeting agendas in
    minutes—not hours—by transforming scattered data into measurable goals,
    targeted accommodations, and plain-language explanations with built-in
    compliance checks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    packs, deep integrations into existing district systems, and a validated
    evidence-based goal/accommodation library—co-developed with educators and
    parent advocates, with measurable quality/acceptance analytics and
    auditability that generic AI or template banks lack.

  character: >-
    Child & Youth Services professionals (caseworkers, school liaisons,
    advocates) who must prepare clear, compliant IEP/504 meetings for students
    and families.
  problem: >-
    They juggle scattered records and complex rules, feel pressed for time and
    worry about missing critical supports—while families need plain-language
    explanations and a fair seat at the table.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to get IEP/504 right. Our AI assistant—built with
    SPED experts and aligned with IDEA/Section 504—compiles progress, drafts
    goals and accommodations, and creates family-friendly explanations and
    meeting agendas, with secure, FERPA-aware handling (not legal advice).
  plan: >-
    1) Import student records or connect your SIS. 2) The assistant synthesizes
    progress and drafts SMART goals, accommodations, agendas, and plain-language
    summaries. 3) You review, edit, and approve. 4) Export packets and talking
    points, share with teams, and track versions. Safeguards: human-in-the-loop
    review, role-based access, audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free pilot or book a 20-minute demo; or download a sample IEP/504
    meeting packet and prep checklist to see the workflow.
  success: >-
    Prep takes minutes, not hours; you walk into meetings confident and
    organized; families understand supports; teams collaborate smoothly;
    documentation is consistent and audit-ready.
  failure: >-
    Without this, prep stays chaotic, documents arrive late or incomplete,
    families feel confused, meetings turn adversarial, and compliance risk and
    burnout grow.
