  problem:
    - >-
      Seasonal and regional demand swings (spring mowing surge, fall leaf
      management, winter snow removal) create high forecast error for both
      production and service parts.
    - >-
      Intermittent, long-tail service parts demand leads to excess inventory,
      stockouts, and poor planner productivity when using traditional
      time-series tools.
    - >-
      Supplier lead times are volatile and often mis-specified, causing late
      buys, expedites, and missed build plans.
    - >-
      Disconnected planning for production and service parts results in
      competing priorities, cannibalized inventory, and suboptimal cash use.
    - >-
      Lack of external signals (weather, regional sell-through,
      warranty/telematics) in forecasts reduces responsiveness to real demand.
    - >-
      Existing enterprise planning tools are slow to implement, generic (not
      tailored to NAICS 333112), and expensive to customize for seasonality and
      intermittent demand.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-source data: historical orders/shipments
      (SKU-location-channel), dealer POS/sell-through, warranty claims,
      telematics usage hours, supplier lead times, pricing/promotions, catalog
      supersessions, and external weather/seasonality signals.
    - >-
      Forecast engine built for intermittent, seasonal demand: hierarchical
      SKU-location forecasting with Croston/TSB variants, probabilistic models
      (P50/P90), and gradient-boosted/temporal models with weather covariates
      and regional calendars.
    - >-
      Lead-time and risk modeling: per-supplier lead-time distributions,
      variability and reliability scoring, and dynamic safety stock
      recommendations to hit target service levels (e.g., 95–98%).
    - >-
      Buy-plan optimizer: generates time-phased purchase proposals respecting
      MOQs, pack sizes, supplier calendars, budget caps, capacity constraints,
      and expedite rules, with scenario comparisons (baseline vs. weather-shock
      vs. promotion).
    - >-
      Unified production + service planning: shared visibility to prevent
      service cannibalization of production-critical parts and vice versa;
      recommends allocations and planned transfers across DCs/plants.
    - >-
      Planner workbench: exception-based alerts (forecast bias, service risk,
      stale inventory), root-cause explainability (weather spike, promo, new
      model cannibalization), and one-click approval to ERP/EDI.
    - >-
      Rapid integration: prebuilt connectors for common ERPs/WMS and dealer
      networks; go-live in 8–12 weeks with a 90-day pilot focused on 2–3 product
      families.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-tuned AI that forecasts regional, seasonal, and intermittent demand
    for lawn and garden equipment parts and auto-generates optimal buy plans
    under real lead-time, MOQ, and budget constraints—cutting inventory 10–20%
    while improving fill rate 1–3 points within one season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical focus on lawn & garden equipment with pre-trained
    seasonal/weather-aware models, part taxonomy templates (blades, belts,
    filters, batteries, engines), and lifecycle/supersession handling—plus a
    unified optimizer that co-plans production and service parts. This yields
    faster time-to-value (8–12 weeks) and better accuracy on intermittent demand
    than generic planning suites.
