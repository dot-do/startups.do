  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers spend 10–25 minutes per unit creating titles/descriptions and
      uploading photos across website and marketplaces, leading to 8–20 staff
      hours/week lost for a 100-unit store.
    - >-
      Photos are inconsistent (background clutter, wrong aspect ratio, no
      watermark), driving 15–30% lower CTR on marketplaces and hurting brand
      perception.
    - >-
      Listings are out-of-sync across channels (sold units still live, price
      mismatches), creating customer friction and chargeback risk; average sync
      lag is 24–72 hours without automation.
    - >-
      SEO underperforms: titles lack model/year/geo keywords and specs; most
      dealer SRP/VDP pages don’t rank for local long-tail searches (e.g., “2022
      Polaris RZR XP 1000 in Phoenix”).
    - >-
      No unified analytics for merchandising ROI; dealers can’t tie listing
      quality to leads, time-to-first-lead, or gross per unit.
    - >-
      Limited in-house marketing expertise and high turnover; onboarding new
      staff to multiple listing tools is costly and slow.
    - >-
      Compliance and brand consistency issues (OEM MAP, disclaimers, fees)
      expose dealers to penalties and reputation damage.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI generates SEO-optimized titles/descriptions with local keywords,
      trim/specs, and compliance disclaimers; supports multi-language
      (EN/ES/FR).
    - >-
      VIN/model decode and spec enrichment from OEM/data partners; auto-fills
      key attributes (engine, hours/miles, drive, color, accessories).
    - >-
      Automated photo cleanup: background removal, exposure/color correction,
      1:1/4:3/16:9 resizing, watermarking, and image ordering (hero angle
      first).
    - >-
      Syndication hub: real-time feeds/APIs to dealer website and marketplaces
      (CycleTrader/ATVTrader/PWCTrader/SnowmobileTrader by Trader Interactive,
      eBay Motors, Facebook Marketplace via partner integration, Craigslist
      posting automation).
    - >-
      Bidirectional sync: status, price, and availability updates within
      minutes; auto-pulls leads/analytics back to a single dashboard.
    - >-
      QA and compliance: duplicate detection, MAP checks, mandatory disclaimers,
      and OEM style guides baked into templates.
    - >-
      Analytics: listing quality score, CTR, time-to-first-lead, lead source
      attribution, and A/B testing of titles/photos.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every unit into a high-performing, compliant, and fully syndicated
    listing in under 60 seconds—AI-crafted titles/descriptions, studio-quality
    photos, and one-click distribution to your website and top
    marketplaces—measured by faster time-to-first-lead, higher CTR, and fewer
    listing errors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A powersports-specific AI and syndication engine trained on millions of
    marketplace impressions and dealer outcomes, combined with certified,
    real-time integrations across the DMS–website–marketplace stack. This yields
    faster sync, higher listing quality, and compliance out of the box that
    generalist tools and in-house workflows can’t match.
