leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual planning in Excel/WhatsApp leads to frequent resequencing and poor
      visibility; planners spend 4–10 hours per week to build a schedule that is
      obsolete within a day.
    - >-
      High changeover time due to gauge/diameter/color/yarn count switches
      (often 10–25% of available time), causing lost capacity and overtime.
    - >-
      Late deliveries (typical OTD 70–85%) driven by optimistic promise dates,
      dyehouse batching constraints, yarn availability, and machine
      compatibility limits.
    - >-
      Overtime costs and labor fatigue rise when rush orders disrupt the plan;
      typical overtime 8–15% of total hours in busy seasons.
    - >-
      Generic APS/ERP modules ignore knitting-specific constraints (cylinder
      compatibility, sinker/needles wear, elastane plating, feeder
      availability), producing impractical plans that floor teams reject.
    - >-
      Siloed data: order book in ERP, machine states on local HMIs, and yarn
      inventory in spreadsheets—preventing constraint-aware planning and
      proactive risk alerts.
    - >-
      Unclear ROI: leaders lack measurable KPIs linking planning decisions to
      OTD, changeovers, and energy/overtime spend.
  solution:
    - >-
      Purpose-built constraint model for knitting: machine–style compatibility
      (gauge, diameter, feeders), color/yarn changeover matrix, operator skill,
      maintenance windows, and dyehouse batching needs.
    - >-
      Optimization engine (CP-SAT/MILP + domain heuristics) assigns jobs to
      machines and sequences to minimize weighted objectives: changeovers,
      lateness, overtime, and setups.
    - >-
      Continuous re-optimization on real-time signals (downtime, yarn stock-out,
      rush orders) with stable schedule windows (e.g., freeze next 8 hours) to
      avoid shop-floor churn.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate priorities (e.g., key buyer rush), alternate
      yarn lots, or overtime caps; quantify impacts on OTD, changeovers, and
      hours.
    - >-
      Promise-date assistant: checks feasibility before order confirmation and
      recommends commit dates and capacity reservations.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: publish machine-wise plan to floor
      displays/WhatsApp, capture feedback/completions, learn actuals to refine
      setup matrix and speeds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase on-time delivery by 5–15 points, cut changeover minutes by 15–30%,
    and reduce overtime 5–20% within 90 days—using an AI optimizer purpose-built
    for knit fabric mills that respects real machine/yarn/dyehouse constraints
    and integrates with your ERP/MES.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A knitting-specific optimization IP: validated changeover matrices and
    heuristics for gauge/diameter/color sequencing; rapid connectors to common
    textile ERPs; schedule-stability controls trusted by floor teams; and a
    growing anonymized dataset that improves setup/throughput estimates per
    machine type—difficult for generic APS vendors to replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:

      overtime) measured on baseline vs pilot period.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Mill planners and operations leaders at knit fabric mills who must keep
    machines productive and hit delivery dates without burning the team out.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented orders, varied yarn and dye setups, and limited
    machines create complex schedules with costly changeovers and bottlenecks.
    Internal: Planners firefight, second-guess priorities, and replan late into
    the night. Philosophical: Smart mills should not lose margin and sleep
    because scheduling is guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the chaos of late dye lots, rush orders, and setup-heavy
    machines. Authority: Our team blends textile operations expertise with
    proven AI optimization used in process and discrete manufacturing.
  plan: >-
    3-step plan: 1) Connect: sync orders, routings, machine calendars, and
    changeover rules from ERP/MES. 2) Optimize: assign machines and sequence
    runs to minimize changeovers, lateness, and overtime while honoring
    constraints. 3) Operate: publish the knit plan, track execution, and
    reoptimize on changes; monthly reviews to lock in gains. Success agreement:
    clear KPIs, data security, and a low-risk pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and share a sample order file. Transitional:
    Request a free schedule audit with a what-if report on one week of orders.
  success: >-
    Reliable promise dates, fewer changeovers, higher on-time delivery, lower
    overtime, higher machine utilization, and calmer planners with clear
    priorities.
  failure: >-
    Late orders, excess overtime, wasted setups, idle machines, and lost margin
    to expediting and penalties.
