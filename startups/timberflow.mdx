leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Schedules are built in spreadsheets and whiteboards, making them fragile,
      hard to maintain, and dependent on a few key people.
    - >-
      Plants face complex constraints (machine capacity, skill certifications,
      curing/drying times, changeover matrices, kitting/transport windows) that
      current tools do not model, leading to infeasible plans.
    - >-
      Poor finite-capacity visibility causes overpromising and on-time delivery
      (OTD) often below 80–85%.
    - >-
      High WIP and long lead times due to early release of work and poor
      sequencing (queues before bottlenecks, blocked materials).
    - >-
      Frequent disruptions (rush orders, change orders, machine downtime) force
      complete replanning that takes hours, not minutes.
    - >-
      Floor crews lack clear priorities; “work-to” lists are missing or stale,
      creating idle time, firefighting, and rework.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (CAD/CAM, ERP, MES, spreadsheets) hinder a single
      source of truth and fast rescheduling.
    - >-
      Material availability is not synced with scheduling, causing starts
      without kits ready and downstream starvation.
    - >-
      Capacity planning for shifts/overtime/subcontracting is manual, making it
      hard to respond to demand swings.
    - >-
      Coordinating production completion with site delivery windows, crane
      bookings, and installation sequences is error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate data from ERP (orders, BOM, routings), CAD/CAM (cut lists, part
      geometry), MES/PLCs (machine status), inventory, and delivery schedules.
    - >-
      Build a digital factory model: work centers, routings, setup/changeover
      matrices, skill/certification matrix, shift calendars, maintenance,
      buffers, truck docks.
    - >-
      Optimize with a hybrid CP-SAT/MILP + heuristics engine for finite-capacity
      scheduling and batching; multi-objective (OTD, WIP, changeover, priority).
    - >-
      Provide rough-cut and detailed capacity planning: simulate shift/overtime
      changes, subcontracting, and due date promises (capable-to-promise).
    - >-
      Enable dynamic rescheduling on events (machine down, material late, hot
      order) with user-defined freeze windows for floor stability.
    - >-
      Auto-generate cell/line/crew “work-to” lists with barcoded job travelers;
      live updates via tablets; capture start/complete and reason codes.
    - >-
      Prefab-specific constraint library: glue/paint curing, press/oven dwell
      times, moisture checks, crane availability, kitting gates, truck loading
      windows, lot/length nesting for saws.
    - >-
      Scenario planning sandbox to compare alternatives (e.g., color batching vs
      due-date pull) with projected KPI impacts and ROI.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit and alerts: OTD, schedule adherence, queue times, utilization,
      changeover loss, WIP $, bottleneck detection.
    - >-
      Secure APIs and off-the-shelf connectors; optional edge gateway
      (OPC-UA/MQTT) for machine data ingestion.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A prefab-wood-specific APS that creates feasible, constraint-respecting
    schedules in minutes and pushes prioritized work-to lists to every cell —
    improving OTD by 10–20 percentage points, cutting WIP 15–30%, and halving
    planner effort within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized APS with out-of-the-box prefab-wood constraint templates and
    native connectors to CAD/CAM and OEM equipment enables 4–8 week go-lives (vs
    6–12 months for generic APS/MES). A pilot program contractually tied to
    measurable OTD/WIP gains reduces buyer risk and creates high switching costs
    for competitors lacking domain templates and integrations.

  character: >-
    Operations and plant leaders at prefabricated wood building manufacturers
    (NAICS 321992) who need reliable, constraint-aware schedules and clear
    work-to lists.
  problem: >-
    A complex job-shop with shared resources, changeovers, cure/finish times,
    and variable crews creates poor visibility—planners firefight, bottlenecks
    starve, overtime spikes, and ship dates slip.
  guide: >-
    An AI scheduling partner with wood manufacturing expertise. We model real
    constraints and capacity, then translate plans into practical, trusted
    work-to lists for every cell.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES data (orders, routings, calendars). 2) Capture
    constraints and capacity (machines, crews, shifts, setups, materials,
    maintenance). 3) Optimize finite schedules and publish daily work-to lists
    with what-if scenarios and promise-date checks. Optional 60-day pilot and
    training.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo and launch a 60-day pilot.
  success: >-
    On-time, in-full deliveries; higher throughput; lower WIP and overtime;
    accurate promise dates; stable crews; and a living schedule that keeps every
    station running the right work next.
  failure: >-
    Missed ship dates, rush freight, idle or overloaded bottlenecks, growing
    WIP, stressed planners, and shrinking margins.

    title: AI Scheduling & Capacity Planning for Prefab Wood (Job‑Shop)
    subtitle: >-
      Optimize factory schedules with real constraints and auto-generate work‑to
      lists. Built for Prefabricated Wood Building Manufacturing (NAICS 321992).
    ctaText: Book a 20‑minute demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Spreadsheets and whiteboards break when orders change or rush jobs appear.
    - Crews idle while saws/CNCs bottleneck; changeovers eat capacity.
    - 'Wall, floor, and roof lines fall out of sync with truck/load dates.'
    - Overtime and shift decisions are guesswork without clear capacity.
    - Operators lack fresh work‑to lists; priorities shift mid‑shift.
    - WIP piles up; promise dates slip; material readiness is unclear.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-aware, finite-capacity schedules across cutting, CNC, panel,
      framing, sheathing, finishing, and pack/ship.
    - >-
      Real-time rescheduling for order changes, downtime, rework, and labor
      shifts.
    - Forward/backward planning to hit due dates and truck/load windows.
    - Auto-generated work‑to lists per work center for the next 2–8 hours.
    - 'Clear promise dates you can commit to, backed by capacity reality.'
    - 'What‑if simulations for overtime, sequencing, batch sizes, and splits.'
  features:
    - >-
      Job‑shop optimizer tailored to prefab wood routings and precedence
      constraints.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity, sequence-dependent scheduling with setup/changeover
      rules.
    - Crew and skill constraints; cross-training and minimum staffing levels.
    - Material/kit readiness checks and length/nesting windows at saws/CNCs.
    - Truck/load planning to align production with ship and install dates.
    - >-
      Live updates from scans/MES; instant refresh of dispatch lists on the
      floor.
    - 'Dashboards: on‑time, throughput, WIP, utilization, schedule adherence.'
    - 'What‑if sandbox: add a shift, approve overtime, re-sequence, split jobs.'
    - 'ERP/MES connectors (Epicor, JobBOSS, Microsoft D365, CSV/API).'
    - Digital work‑to boards and mobile operator views for each work center.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect data: routings, centers, calendars, BOM/kits, open orders
      (CSV/API).
    - >-
      Set constraints: cycle times, setup matrices, crews/skills, shifts, truck
      windows.
    - Generate first schedule and validate on the floor with supervisors.
    - Pilot work‑to lists on 1–2 lines; tune rules and KPIs.
    - >-
      Go live: publish daily schedule and rolling dispatch; review weekly and
      improve.
