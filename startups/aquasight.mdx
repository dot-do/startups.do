  problem:
    - >-
      High scrap and rework from undetected cap-seal leaks, under/over-fill,
      label skew, and unreadable date codes, especially during changeovers and
      fast ramp-ups.
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection is inconsistent; defect escape rates rise with
      operator fatigue and line speeds (>300 bpm).
    - >-
      Traditional inline machine-vision systems require high capex
      ($50k–$200k/line), integrators, and changeover retuning—unattractive for
      small/mid-size bottled water producers.
    - >-
      Complaint chargebacks and retailer returns due to labeling/date-code
      defects erode margins and threaten listings.
    - >-
      Plants lack low-friction, auditable QC evidence for HACCP/BRCGS/ISO 22000
      without adding headcount or on-prem IT.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload images or short video clips via mobile app or browser; optional IP
      camera snapshots via secure bridge (no on-prem server).
    - >-
      AI models specialized for PET bottled water packaging detect cap seal
      integrity, fill height variance, label skew/tear/bubble, date-code
      presence/legibility/placement.
    - >-
      Instant pass/fail with heatmaps, confidence scores, and operator feedback
      loop; alerts when defect rates exceed control limits.
    - >-
      Shift/batch reports and audit trails mapped to SKU/lot for HACCP/BRCGS
      evidence.
    - >-
      Model templates per bottle format and label type; guided changeover wizard
      reduces retuning time <10 minutes.
    - >-
      Analytics: defect Pareto, FPY, MTBF/MTTR for labeler/capper, model drift
      detection and assisted re-training.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cloud AI QC for bottled water: detect cap seal, fill level, label skew, and
    date-code defects from staff-uploaded images/videos in <2 seconds, no
    on-prem server, delivering measurable yield gains, fewer complaints, and
    audit-ready reports within 2 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary defect dataset uniquely focused on bottled water
    SKUs, environments, and printers—enabling higher accuracy with minimal
    samples; rapid deployment (no on-prem server) and guided changeovers create
    switching costs and network effects as models improve across similar
    packaging types.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Small-to-mid sized bottled water manufacturers (1–6 lines) seeking
      low-capex quality improvements.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality/Operations manager at a bottled water plant who must catch cap‑seal,
    fill‑level, label‑skew, and date‑code defects without adding on‑prem servers
    or slowing the line.
  problem: >-
    External: defects (unsealed caps, under/overfill, skewed labels,
    unreadable/missing date‑codes) slip through. Internal: manual checks are
    slow and inconsistent; legacy vision systems are costly and IT‑heavy.
    Philosophical: quality shouldn’t require stopping production or new
    hardware.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of zero‑defect runs and retailer audits. Vision
    QC uses cloud AI trained on beverage lines to deliver fast, accurate
    inspections from uploaded images/video—securely, with no on‑prem server.
  plan: >-
    1) Set up: create an account, define SKUs/thresholds, connect upload sources
    (line cameras, smartphone, archived video). 2) Inspect: upload images/video;
    AI flags cap‑seal, fill‑level, label‑skew, and date‑code issues with
    timestamps, confidence, and pass/fail actions. 3) Improve: push alerts/API
    to MES/QMS, review dashboards, and refine models via feedback.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot today—create an account, upload sample footage from one line,
    and get same‑day defect reports.
  success: >-
    Consistent in‑spec bottles, faster release, reduced scrap/rework,
    audit‑ready traceability, fewer complaints/recalls, lower QA costs, and
    higher OEE.
  failure: >-
    Missed defects continue, wasted pallets and rework, failed audits and
    chargebacks, avoidable recalls, and erosion of brand trust.

    - Real-time alerts when defect rate exceeds thresholds (email/Slack/SMS).
    - SKU profiles with per-format tolerances; easy tuning per brand/size.
    - 'Role-based access, full audit trail, CSV/PDF exports; QMS/ERP webhooks.'
    - >-
      Secure cloud: encryption at rest/in transit, SSO-ready, data retention
      controls.
    - 'Dashboards: yield, defect trends, and Pareto by line, shift, and plant.'
  steps:
    - Create account and set SKU templates with tolerances.
    - Capture or upload line images/video from staff devices or cameras.
    - Select SKU and lot; run analysis to get results in seconds.
    - Review flagged issues with visual evidence; confirm or correct.
