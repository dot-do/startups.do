  problem:
    - >-
      Chargebacks from major retailers (e.g., Walmart, Amazon VC, Target, JoAnn,
      Michaels, Hobby Lobby) erode 0.5–2.0% of gross revenue; most stem from
      preventable EDI timing/content defects and labeling non-compliance.
    - >-
      Lack of real-time visibility across EDI flows (850/855/856/810/852),
      functional acks (997/999), application advice (824), and 3PL/WMS/TMS
      events makes early detection difficult; issues are found only after
      retailer deductions appear.
    - >-
      ASN (856) timing errors (early/late/missing), SSCC/UCC-128 label
      mismatches, and PO acknowledgment (855) errors are the top causes of
      compliance deductions; manual triage is slow and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Small EDI/IT teams (1–5 people) can’t keep up with retailer rule changes,
      different partner guidelines, and seasonal volume spikes (2–5x) leading to
      a spike in exceptions.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is fragmented across ERP (items/price/pack), WMS
      (pick/pack/ship), TMS (carrier scan events), and EDI (maps/acks), so
      repeated defects persist (e.g., the same label format issue across
      multiple DCs).
    - >-
      Dispute workflows are manual; assembling evidence packages for retailer
      portals takes hours and success rates vary, lengthening DSO and
      write-offs.
    - >-
      Current EDI providers focus on transport and mapping; few offer proactive,
      prescriptive prevention and closed-loop correction tied to operational
      systems.
    - >-
      No standardized KPI framework; leadership can’t quantify
      cost-of-non-compliance per customer/DC/carrier or forecast accruals,
      making margin analysis and pricing decisions weaker.
    - >-
      Multiple 3PLs/DCs with different label printers/processes drive
      inconsistent compliance; no continuous label QA catches defects before
      ship.
    - >-
      Existing tools lack vertical-specific best practices for piece
      goods/notions (inner pack, roll length, ticketing/hangtag nuances,
      color/size grids) causing frequent content mismatches.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on observability for 850/855/856/810/852 flows with correlation to
      997/999/824 and ERP/WMS/TMS events to flag late/missing/invalid docs
      within minutes.
    - >-
      Retailer-specific rule packs (Walmart, Amazon VC, Target, JoAnn, Michaels,
      Hobby Lobby, Costco, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, etc.) mapping routing guide rules
      to executable checks for content, timing, and label compliance.
    - >-
      Prescriptive corrective actions: draft 855 changes, re-ACK, re-issue 856
      with corrected SSCC, trigger split-ship or cancel, update carrier/pro
      numbers, and guide relabeling before shipment cut-off.
    - >-
      Label risk prevention: sample label OCR and GS1-128/SSCC validation,
      master data checks for GTIN/UPC/EAN, carton count checks, and print driver
      profile verification per DC/printer model.
    - >-
      Chargeback detection and dispute automation: scrape/import deductions from
      portals/EDI 812, auto-match evidence (timestamps, scans, 997/999, carrier
      events), and assemble dispute packets with reason-code mapping.
    - >-
      Exception routing to the right owner (Ops/WMS, EDI, Customer Service, 3PL)
      via Slack/Teams/Email with severity, business impact, and due times
      aligned to retailer windows.
    - >-
      Forecasting and accruals: predictive risk scoring by PO/DC/carrier to
      estimate likely deductions; finance accrual support and post-mortem
      savings attribution.
    - >-
      Implementation accelerators: prebuilt connectors for common ERPs
      (NetSuite, MS Dynamics 365/BC/FO, Sage X3/100, Epicor P21, Infor SX.e),
      common WMS/TMS, and major EDI hubs (Cleo, SPS, TrueCommerce, OpenText,
      Orderful).
    - >-
      Compliance knowledge service: continuous updates as retailers change
      routing guides; changelog with simulated impact analysis by
      partner/SKU/DC.
    - >-
      Security & reliability: SOC2 roadmap, field-level PII redaction,
      single-tenant data stores per customer optional, 99.9% uptime.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce retailer compliance deductions 30–60% in 90 days by detecting and
    correcting EDI, timing, and labeling risks before they become
    chargebacks—then auto-assembling dispute packets for what slips through.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, retailer-specific prevention library plus closed-loop
    correction and dispute automation, backed by labeled datasets linking
    EDI/ops signals to actual chargeback outcomes—enabling proactive fixes
    before ship and high-confidence disputes after.
