leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual WPS/PQR coverage checks are slow (6–12 engineer-hours/project) and
      error-prone, risking costly NCRs, rejected welds, and schedule delays.
    - >-
      Many shops’ PQR/WPS libraries are fragmented (PDFs, spreadsheets, legacy
      systems), making it hard to prove coverage for project-specific
      requirements (base metal pairs, thickness, toughness, PWHT, NDE).
    - >-
      Frequent spec creep: Owner/client specs, latest ASME IX/VIII
      edition/addenda, and customer-specific supplements often conflict,
      creating compliance ambiguity without clause-level traceability.
    - >-
      Inefficient planning leads to unnecessary new PQR coupons ($2,500–$5,000
      each incl. lab), or worse, missed required tests (impact testing per
      UCS-66, hardness limits, etc.).
    - >-
      Authorized Inspector (AI) findings and customer audits demand auditable,
      clause-cited justifications that most teams cannot produce quickly.
    - >-
      Bid teams struggle to answer “procedure coverage” during tender phases,
      slowing quotes and reducing win rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest project documents (customer specs, datasheets, ITPs), drawings, and
      current code edition/addenda; parse and normalize requirements.
    - >-
      Auto-map materials (ASTM/ASME/UNS) to P-Numbers/Groups; check thickness
      ranges (QW-451), positions, processes, transfer modes, and
      essential/supplementary variables.
    - >-
      Evaluate Section VIII requirements (e.g., UCS/UG/UW), impact test
      exemptions (UCS-66 curves), PWHT windows, hardness limits, and NDE
      coverage vs project.
    - >-
      Cross-reference against existing WPS/PQR library to produce a coverage
      matrix and quantified gaps (what is missing, why, and how to close).
    - >-
      Generate draft WPS(s) and PQR test plans with clause-level citations;
      recommend minimal new testing to achieve coverage (“least-cost path”).
    - >-
      Provide an auditable report for the Authorized Inspector and customer,
      with change-tracking, revision history, and a sign-off workflow.
    - >-
      Integrations to document control (SharePoint, Dropbox, Google Drive),
      ERP/MES (Epicor, JobBOSS), and WPS software (e.g., ProWrite/C-Spec) for
      continuity.
    - >-
      Optional human-in-the-loop review by CWI/PE for final validation before
      AI/Customer/AI Inspector approval.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Audit-ready, clause-cited WPS/PQR coverage in minutes, not days—reduce
    rework and new coupons while accelerating approvals and bids.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Clause-cited, ASME-aware rule engine co-developed with CWIs/PEs and vetted
    by AIA partners, producing inspector-ready justifications; proprietary
    material/filler mapping and impact/PWHT logic trained on real shop data;
    integrations that turn scattered WPS/PQR libraries into a searchable,
    auditable asset.

  character: >-
    Quality, welding, and manufacturing leaders at heavy‑gauge metal tank
    manufacturers (NAICS 332420) who must keep projects ASME Section VIII/IX
    compliant without slowing production.
  problem: >-
    External: Changing specs, materials, thicknesses, positions, and joints make
    WPS/PQR coverage unclear and audits risky. Internal: You’re unsure what’s
    covered, what needs requalification, and manual cross‑checks waste time.
    Philosophical: Builders should build tanks—not decipher code books. Villain:
    Code complexity and scattered documents.
  guide: >-
    We’re ASME‑focused welding compliance experts combining AI with codified
    rules and CWI/CWE oversight. We’ve mapped thousands of WPS/PQRs and know
    exactly what auditors and Authorized Inspectors look for.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload RFQ/drawings, code edition,
    materials/thicknesses/positions/joints, and current PQRs/WPSs. 2) AI builds
    a coverage matrix, maps essential variables, flags gaps, and drafts
    compliant WPSs. 3) Receive an auditor‑ready package: coverage report, gap
    list, draft WPSs, required PQRs/WPQs, and next steps. Agreement: data stays
    confidential; you approve all procedure changes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on your next job or book a 30‑minute demo.
    Transitional: Download the free Coverage Matrix template and ASME VIII/IX
    audit checklist.
  success: >-
    Confident bids and faster approvals, fewer NCRs and rework, first‑pass weld
    success, clean audits, fully traceable and current procedures, and
    predictable schedules and margins.
  failure: >-
    Avoid rejected procedures, surprise requalification tests, schedule slips,
    scrap, audit findings, and reputational or certification risk.
