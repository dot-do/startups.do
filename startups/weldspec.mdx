  problem:
    - >-
      Creating compliant WPS documents is slow and error-prone; welding
      engineers and CWIs spend 3–8 hours per WPS consolidating code rules,
      filler classifications, and ranges.
    - >-
      Mapping new work to existing PQRs is complex; many shops unnecessarily
      re-qualify procedures (>$3,000 per PQR and 2–6 weeks lead time) due to
      lack of traceability and essential-variable range checks.
    - >-
      Code compliance is a moving target (ASME IX, AWS D1.1, ISO 15614, API
      1104); keeping templates updated across revisions is burdensome and causes
      audit nonconformances.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal; when senior welding engineers leave, WPS/PQR know‑how
      and rationale are lost, creating inconsistency across projects and
      facilities.
    - >-
      Audits are stressful; retrieving correct WPS/PQR sets, welder continuity,
      and heat-input calculations can take days and often results in findings.
    - >-
      Document sprawl; multiple versions of WPS for similar joints cause
      duplication, conflicting parameters, and wasted filler metal inventory.
    - >-
      Inefficient cross-facility reuse; global companies re-qualify procedures
      at different sites because of incompatible systems and poor metadata on
      legacy PQRs.
    - >-
      Manual calculations (preheat, interpass, heat input, thickness range, CVN
      impact) introduce mistakes that can lead to NCRs and repair/rework costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted WPS generator: input base materials, thickness, joint,
      position, process (SMAW/GMAW/FCAW/SAW/GTAW), PWHT/preheat—system proposes
      parameters and essential/nonessential variables within code ranges.
    - >-
      PQR mapping engine: parses existing PQRs (OCR + structured extraction),
      normalizes to P-/Group-/F-/A-number systems, and checks essential-variable
      coverage to recommend qualifying PQRs for the WPS.
    - >-
      Code rules engine: codified logic for thickness ranges, positions,
      backing, CVN/impact requirements, heat input, interpass, preheat (incl.
      carbon equivalent calculators) per selected code/edition.
    - >-
      Templates and export: produce code-specific WPS/PQR documents (Word/PDF),
      weld maps, and welder qualification cross-references with e-signature and
      revision control.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: flag out-of-range variables, missing essential
      data, and edition mismatches; maintain a change log with rationale for
      auditors.
    - >-
      Cross-facility reuse: centralized PQR library with metadata to reduce
      duplicate qualifications and standardize parameters across sites.
    - >-
      Integrations: connect to QMS/ERP (SAP, Oracle, IFS, Infor, Plex), DMS
      (SharePoint), and CAD/BIM (Tekla) for weld map IDs; API for custom
      workflows.
    - >-
      Audit-ready packages: one-click compile of WPS, supporting PQRs, welder
      continuity, calibration, and consumable COC/CMTR links.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate code-aligned WPS in minutes and automatically map work to existing
    qualified PQRs—reducing re-qualification by 25–40%, WPS drafting time by
    60–80%, and audit prep from days to hours, with traceable, up-to-date
    compliance logic for ASME IX, AWS D1.1, ISO 15614, and API 1104.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A codified, versioned compliance knowledge graph plus a trained PQR mapping
    engine built from a large, diverse corpus of real-world PQRs—validated by
    CWIs and auditors—enables uniquely accurate WPS recommendations and
    high-confidence PQR reuse. Deep integrations with QMS/ERP and a growing
    library of vetted, prequalified parameter sets create switching costs and
    network effects across multi-site enterprises.
