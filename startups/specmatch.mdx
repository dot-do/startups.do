leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supply disruptions and long lead-times force unplanned line stoppages;
      identifying and qualifying alternatives takes 6–12 weeks and ties up
      engineering, QA, and procurement.
    - >-
      Specs for paper grades and adhesives are inconsistent across suppliers
      (units, test methods, tolerances), making apples-to-apples comparisons
      slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Knowledge of which substitutes actually run on specific lines is tribal
      and scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and lab notebooks; it isn’t
      searchable or reusable.
    - >-
      Vendor bias and lock-in: supplier cross-reference tools don’t compare
      across the full market, and may miss lower-cost or easier-to-qualify
      options.
    - >-
      Qualification costs (lab testing, trials, waste) and risk of failed
      changes are high; teams lack a data-driven way to predict pass/fail
      likelihood before testing.
    - >-
      Compliance and sustainability constraints (e.g., food-contact, PFAS,
      recyclability) add complexity to substitution decisions and often aren’t
      embedded in selection workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Normalize and enrich supplier datasheets using OCR/NLP and a
      paper/adhesive property ontology (e.g., basis weight, caliper, tensile,
      Cobb, porosity, brightness/opacity, tear, stiffness; peel/shear/tack,
      service temp, viscosity, solids).
    - >-
      Hybrid matching engine: constraint-based filters (must-have specs,
      compliance) + similarity search (vector embeddings) + ML models that
      predict pass/fail probability for your process context (line speed, nip
      pressure, cure/oven settings).
    - >-
      Evidence-backed recommendations: rank alternatives by risk, expected
      performance deltas, availability, price, and sustainability impact; show
      provenance (spec sections, prior runs, lab data).
    - >-
      Workflow to qualify substitutes: auto-generate TAPPI/PSTC/ASTM-aligned
      test plans, track lab and line-trial results, and update Approved Vendor
      Lists (AVL) in ERP/PLM.
    - >-
      Supplier and distributor connectors for pricing/lead-time feeds; optional
      brokerage to independent labs for verification testing.
    - >-
      Compliance layer: map materials to 21 CFR food-contact, REACH/SVHC,
      California Proposition 65, and PFAS status; flag gaps and propose
      compliant options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFQ-to-qualified-substitute cycle time by 50–70% and reduce material
    costs 3–8% by recommending drop-in or near drop-in paper and adhesive
    alternatives matched to your exact specs, line conditions, and past
    performance—complete with risk scoring, test plans, and compliance checks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop performance dataset linking material specs to real plant
    conditions and outcomes across multiple converters, enabling explainable,
    high-precision predictions that generic databases, vendor cross-references,
    and in-house spreadsheets cannot replicate; integrated workflow that updates
    AVL and compliance automatically, increasing switching costs and
    defensibility.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      coated/laminated paper products, die-cut paper goods) with 100–1000
      employees and $50M–$1B revenue.
    - >-

      Siemens Teamcenter/Windchill) to reduce integration friction.
    - >-
      Freemium lead magnet: “Spec Comparator” tool that normalizes two PDFs and
      highlights differences; requires registration and captures intent.
    - >-
      Pilot-first GTM: 8–12 week paid pilots with success milestones (e.g., 20

  character: >-
    Ops, sourcing, and process engineers at converted paper product
    manufacturers (NAICS 322299) who need reliable, fast material replacements
    without sacrificing performance or compliance.
  problem: >-
    When a paper, liner, or adhesive is discontinued, delayed, or too costly,
    finding a true drop-in substitute is slow and risky—specs are inconsistent,
    trials are wasteful, and requalification threatens delivery, cost, and
    compliance.
  guide: >-
    Spec-Matching is a vendor-neutral, secure AI trained on converting specs and
    past outcomes. It normalizes data, compares multi-parameter performance, and
    recommends drop-in or near-drop-in paper/adhesive substitutes with rationale
    and confidence scores.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload target spec and constraints (mechanical, adhesive, regulatory,
    process limits). 2) Receive a ranked shortlist with risk flags, tuning tips,
    and availability/cost signals. 3) Run rapid trials with auto-generated
    protocols and log results to build approved alternates.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a low-risk pilot on priority SKUs or book a 30-minute demo; request an
    NDA data fit check.
  success: >-
    Faster, confident substitutions; fewer trial cycles; reduced downtime and
    scrap; qualified alternates on file; resilient multi-sourcing; maintained
    performance and compliance; improved cost and lead times.
  failure: >-
    Avoid line-down events, emergency reformulations, out-of-spec shipments,
    compliance surprises, and margin erosion caused by mismatched materials and
    guesswork.
