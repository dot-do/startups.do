  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs/tenders for pumps, skids, and metering systems are long (100–1,000+
      pages), varied, and arrive in multiple formats (PDF, Word, portal
      exports), creating a manual, error-prone extraction process.
    - >-
      Mapping technical requirements (e.g., API 610/675, ISO 5199/2858,
      ATEX/IECEx, NACE MR0175, materials, curves, NPSH, motor classes) to
      specific catalog/configurable items takes 20–60 engineer-hours per RFQ.
    - >-
      Compliance matrices and deviation lists are manually created,
      inconsistent, and miss items—leading to non-compliant bids, rework, and
      disqualifications.
    - >-
      Proposal cycles (10–15 business days) are too slow for competitive
      tenders; late or incomplete bids reduce win rates and damage OEM
      reputation.
    - >-
      Commercial qualifiers (incoterms, warranty, LDs, inspection/test plans,
      documentation packs) are scattered across RFQs and often misaligned with
      internal policies, causing margin leakage.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling (email, Excel, SharePoint, ERP/CPQ) leads to poor
      version control, duplication, and limited learning from past
      bids/wins/losses.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from PDFs/Word/portals; normalize and segment by sections
      (specs, datasheets, ITT, commercial terms, QA/QC, ITPs).
    - >-
      Extract technical requirements (ratings, curves, materials, standards,
      certifications) and commercial clauses into a structured requirement set.
    - >-
      Map requirements to catalog/configurable items via a product knowledge
      graph (models, options, BOM rules) and constraints solver; propose
      fit-grade and alternates.
    - >-
      Auto-generate compliance matrix (requirement, response, compliance status,
      evidence) and deviation register (fatal/major/minor) with links to RFQ
      clauses.
    - >-
      Draft technical proposal content (datasheets, sectional descriptions,
      P&IDs references, test procedures), and commercial responses
      (exceptions/clarifications, T&Cs alignment).
    - >-
      Provide confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop review to accept, edit,
      or re-train mappings; track revisions and approvals.
    - >-
      Export deliverables in customer-required templates; push results to
      CRM/CPQ/ERP and tender portals.
    - >-
      Analytics: cycle time, compliance coverage, deviation patterns, margin
      risk flags; feedback loop from wins/losses to improve recommendations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Draft compliant, auditable technical and commercial responses in hours, not
    days—by extracting RFQ requirements, mapping them to your
    catalog/configurators, auto-building compliance matrices, and highlighting
    deviations with confidence scores. Increase win rate and protect margins
    through standard-aware, industry-specific AI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A standard-aware product knowledge graph and rulepacks purpose-built for
    pumps/skids/metering, trained with expert-labeled RFQs and outcomes from
    early lighthouse OEMs. Feedback loops from wins/losses and deviation
    handling create proprietary datasets and continuously improving mappings
    that generic RFP tools or horizontal CPQ cannot easily replicate.

  character: >-
    Applications engineers, proposal/bid managers, and sales teams at pump,
    skid, and metering-system manufacturers who must deliver compliant
    RFQ/tender responses quickly and accurately.
  problem: >-
    RFQs are long, inconsistent, and technical; mapping requirements to catalog
    items is tedious and error-prone; deadlines are tight and missing a
    requirement risks rejection and margin loss. It shouldn’t take heroic
    copy‑paste and late nights to submit a compliant bid.
  guide: >-
    RFQ/Tender Response Composer is an AI service purpose-built for measuring,
    dispensing, and other pumping equipment manufacturers. Domain-trained models
    use your catalog, templates, and rules to draft compliant
    technical/commercial responses, create compliance matrices, map requirements
    to items, suggest equivalents, and highlight deviations—with full
    traceability.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload RFQ documents, BoQs, and your catalog/templates. 2) AI maps
    requirements to items, drafts responses, builds a compliance matrix, and
    flags deviations/assumptions. 3) You review, adjust, and export to customer
    formats; optional ERP/CRM integration and approval workflows.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo; start a short pilot with live RFQs; go live on your
    next tender.
  success: >-
    Respond faster with consistent, compliant proposals; increase win rates;
