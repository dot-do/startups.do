  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier feeds are sparse/inconsistent, producing thin or duplicate
      content that fails to rank. Common: 50–70% of SKUs share near-duplicate
      descriptions across retailers; 20–40% of product pages lack key attributes
      (age range, piece count, materials, dimensions).
    - >-
      Manual copywriting doesn’t scale. Writing/QA for 5,000 SKUs at 8–12
      minutes each = 667–1,000 hours (4–6 FTE weeks) per season; new
      releases/seasonality overwhelm small teams.
    - >-
      Missing/incorrect structured data (Product, FAQPage) and poor meta titles
      reduce CTR. Typical CTR for generic snippets: 1.2–2.0%; targetable uplift
      to 2.5–4.0% with optimized titles, rich results, and FAQs.
    - >-
      Slow time-to-live for new SKUs (days/weeks) means lost revenue windows for
      hot releases (TCG sets, holiday toys). Retailers need same-day
      enrichment/publish.
    - >-
      Compliance gaps: CPSIA/choking hazard/battery warnings often omitted or
      inconsistent; MAP-sensitive phrasing needs guardrails.
    - >-
      Feed quality issues lead to Google Merchant Center disapprovals (GTIN,
      identifier_exists, missing age group), hurting Shopping and Local
      Inventory Ads.
    - >-
      Poor attribute extraction hurts faceted navigation and onsite search
      (filters for age, brand, theme, scale, skill level).
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect supplier feeds (CSV/XML/API) and store platform; normalize and
      deduplicate SKUs (GTIN/MPN/brand).
    - >-
      Generate SEO-optimized titles, bullets, long descriptions, FAQs, image alt
      text, and meta tags using hobby/toy/game-tuned templates.
    - >-
      Auto-generate structured data (Product, Offer, AggregateRating if
      available, FAQPage) and validate; push JSON-LD to PDPs.
    - >-
      Extract/standardize attributes (age range, piece count, materials,
      dimensions, batteries, skill level, theme, genre) for faceted navigation
      and filters.
    - >-
      Compliance layer: CPSIA/choking hazard/battery/safety disclaimers;
      MAP-sensitive copyguard; claim moderation workflow.
    - >-
      Google taxonomy mapping and feed enrichment (GMC attributes,
      identifier_exists, condition, age group, gender where applicable).
    - >-
      A/B test titles/meta, and FAQ presence; integrate with Search Console to
      learn from impressions/CTR by query and iterate.
    - >-
      Push-to-store connectors (Shopify/BigCommerce/Woo) with preview, bulk
      approve, and rollback; change log per SKU.
    - >-
      Performance dashboard: indexation coverage, CTR, schema errors, organic
      sessions per SKU, revenue lift estimates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn raw supplier specs into compliant, brand-voiced product pages that rank
    and convert—at SKU-scale and pushed directly to your store. Expected
    outcomes in 90 days: +20–40% organic sessions on enriched SKUs vs. control,
    +30–80% SERP CTR improvement on optimized pages, <24 hours time-to-live for
    new releases, and duplicate content rate <10%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical specialization: proprietary toy/game/hobby taxonomy and attribute
    extractors; retailer-tested templates for TCG/model/RC/board game
    subcategories; compliance guardrails (CPSIA/battery/choking hazards) and
    MAP-safe phrasing; distributor feed partnerships; closed-loop optimization
    from Search Console at SKU-level; push-to-store with governance and A/B
    built-in.
