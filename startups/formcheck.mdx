  problem:
    - >-
      Design teams discover manufacturability issues (draft, wall thickness,
      bend radii, support/overhangs) late, causing change orders and 2–6 week
      delays.
    - >-
      Existing DFM tools are heavyweight, expensive, and tuned for specialists;
      ID/ME teams need fast, early “good-enough” checks inside their CAD flow.
    - >-
      DFM guidance is inconsistent across suppliers; designers struggle to apply
      process-specific rules (injection molding, sheet metal, 3DP) for each
      material and vendor capability.
    - >-
      Manual reviews are slow and subjective; organizations lack measurable,
      repeatable DFM criteria pre–design freeze.
    - >-
      Prototyping and quoting platforms give feedback post-upload; teams want
      instant checks while modeling to avoid rework.
    - >-
      Enterprises lack centralized knowledge capture of recurring DFM issues and
      preferred fixes, leading to repeated mistakes.
    - >-
      For 3DP, failed builds due to orientation, thin walls, and unsupported
      features waste machine time and budget.
  solution:
    - >-
      CAD plug-ins (SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion 360, NX) that run instant DFM
      checks for Injection, Sheet Metal, and 3DP with redline overlays and
      severity scores.
    - >-
      Auto-fix suggestions (e.g., adjust draft angles, rib thickness, bend
      relief) with parameterized edits or guided wizards; designer remains in
      control.
    - >-
      Process/material libraries with supplier capability profiles (min/max
      wall, radii, K-factor, tolerance bands) configurable per vendor.
    - >-
      Batch check for assemblies with basic DFA heuristics (fastener count, part
      count, symmetry, commonality).
    - >-
      Exportable DFM report (PDF/HTML) with issue list, rationale, and evidence
      for design reviews and supplier communication.
    - >-
      Team dashboard that tracks issue trends, ECO avoidance, and time saved;
      rule authoring to capture internal standards.
    - >-
      API for platforms (quoting/manufacturing networks) to pre-screen customer
      uploads and produce consistent guidance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, in-CAD DFM/DFA “lite” checks with auto-fix suggestions for
    injection molding, sheet metal, and 3D printing—under 60 seconds, before
    design freeze—reducing change orders by 30–50% and cutting time-to-tool by
    2–4 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound knowledge graph of manufacturability issues and validated fixes
    tied to supplier capability profiles, improving with each check; in-CAD
    auto-fix workflows and multi-process coverage (Injection, Sheet Metal, 3DP)
    make it faster and more actionable than post-upload or heavyweight
    enterprise tools.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
