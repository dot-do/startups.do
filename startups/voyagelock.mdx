leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Lock transits create unpredictable delays (1–12+ hours) due to queues,
      draft/air-draft windows, and booking rules; manual planning rarely
      accounts for dynamic queue and stage forecasts.
    - >-
      Operators lack a unified planner that simultaneously respects locks,
      tides/water levels, bridge air-draft, speed restrictions, pilotage
      windows, and under-keel clearance (UKC) while optimizing for fuel/time.
    - >-
      Great Lakes and near-coastal routes face volatile water levels and
      weather-driven seiche; static plans cause missed windows and excess fuel
      burn from speed-ups.
    - >-
      Current tools focus on blue-water weather routing; inland/coastal
      constraints and lock/bridge rules are handled by experience and
      spreadsheets, leading to inconsistent outcomes and safety risk.
    - >-
      Shoreside dispatch and vessel crews operate on different data timelines;
      lack of real-time re-optimization causes unnecessary waiting and
      demurrage.
    - >-
      Poor ETA accuracy to locks/ports/pilots undermines slot assignments, berth
      planning, and tug scheduling, driving cost overruns.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: protected-species speed zones (coastal), local
      security/safety zones, and draft/UKC rules require constant monitoring and
      proof of compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-constraint routing engine that models locks, tides/water levels,
      bridge clearance windows, local speed/traffic rules, pilotage, and UKC in
      a single graph optimizer.
    - >-
      Real-time lock queue ingestion and ETA-synchronized lock appointment
      management with predictive wait times and auto-rescheduling suggestions.
    - >-
      Dynamic re-optimization onboard and shoreside when conditions change
      (water level, weather, traffic, lock outages), with explainable
      recommendations.
    - >-
      UKC and squat calculator using bathymetry, water levels, wave/swell
      (coastal), vessel particulars, and speed profile; alerts for predicted
      low-clearance events.
    - >-
      Bridge air-draft planner using tidal stages/Seaway levels, adjustable
      ballast scenarios, and clearance margins with time windows.
    - >-
      Speed and fuel optimizer that balances arrival windows, compliance zones,
      and fuel curves; supports “arrive just-in-time” to minimize lock wait and
      berth idle.
    - >-
      What-if simulators for dispatch to compare routes/slots, quantify
      fuel/time/demurrage trade-offs, and export to charter party/ops plans.
    - >-
      APIs/SDKs to integrate with ECDIS, dispatch/maintenance (e.g., Helm
      CONNECT), and AIS/telemetry; offline-ready onboard app with periodic sync.
    - >-
      Compliance mode: automatic logging and evidence packs for speed-restricted
      zones, UKC margins, and local notices to mariners.

  character: >-
    Coastal and Great Lakes freight operators, dispatchers, and captains who
    must deliver safely, on time, and on budget across lock- and
    bridge‑constrained waterways.
  problem: >-
    Manual or generic routing can’t reliably account for lock/bridge windows,
    tides and water levels, UKC limits, speed‑restricted zones, and
    traffic—leading to missed slots, delays, excess fuel burn, compliance risk,
    and blown ETAs.
  guide: >-
    Voyage + Lock‑Constrained Route Optimizer is an AI co‑pilot built for
    constrained coastal and Great Lakes routes. We understand the pressure of
    narrow safety margins and tight schedules, and we combine live AIS, official
    hydrographic data, lock/bridge schedules, water‑level and tide forecasts,
    bathymetry, and your UKC policy to produce safe, efficient routes.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import vessel particulars, draft/UKC policy, lanes, and data
    feeds (AIS/ECDIS/dispatch). 2) Optimize: Generate fuel‑ and time‑efficient
    routes respecting locks, bridge clearances, tide/water levels,
    speed‑restricted zones, and UKC; forecast ETAs and fuel. 3) Navigate &
    adapt: Monitor conditions and traffic, re‑optimize en route, and deliver
    updated wheelhouse guidance and compliance logs.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot on your busiest lanes or book a 30‑minute demo with a free
    route study.
  success: >-
    On‑time arrivals, lower fuel and emissions, fewer lock waits, predictable
    ETAs, documented UKC and speed compliance, improved safety margins, and
    higher fleet utilization and profitability.
  failure: >-
    Missed lock windows, tide/clearance surprises, speed/no‑wake violations,
    unnecessary fuel burn and overtime, uncertain ETAs, and heightened
    grounding/collision risk that erodes customer trust and margins.
