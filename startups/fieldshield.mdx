leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Warranty and recall risks surface late because issues are discovered via
      lagging indicators (claims, dealer calls) 4–12 weeks after field onset.
    - >-
      CAN/telematics signals are noisy and inconsistent across models and
      suppliers (J1939/ISO 11783 variations, proprietary SPNs), making
      cross-fleet analytics hard.
    - >-
      Current rule-based diagnostics miss compound or intermittent failure
      precursors; emerging spikes go undetected until claim volumes surge.
    - >-
      Claims costs concentrate in a small set of failure modes; without early
      detection, average cost/repair is 15–30% higher due to collateral damage
      and logistics.
    - >-
      Dealers face alert fatigue from high false-positive diagnostic trouble
      codes (DTCs), leading to low action rates and missed true emergent issues.
    - >-
      Quality, warranty, and engineering systems (PLM/ERP/Warranty DB) are
      siloed, slowing root-cause analysis and recall decisions.
    - >-
      Supply-chain planning lacks early signals, causing parts stockouts and
      extended downtime when spikes hit.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize machine telematics (CAN, GPS, duty cycles) across
      mixed OEM/model years via connectors for J1939/ISO 11783 and proprietary
      PGNs/SPNs.
    - >-
      Fuse signals with parts/BOM, build history, and warranty claim data to
      create labeled failure-mode datasets (FMECAs).
    - >-
      Run streaming anomaly and population-spike detection that clusters
      co-occurring signals and operating context (load, ambient, implement
      used).
    - >-
      Score machines daily for failure likelihood and cost severity; generate
      risk-ranked watchlists and service bulletins with recommended
      diagnostics/parts kits.
    - >-
      Detect emerging spikes (e.g., week-over-week incidence rate rises) and
      escalate to Quality/Legal with recall risk indicators and affected VIN
      ranges.
    - >-
      Integrate with PLM/ERP/Warranty systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle) and dealer DMS
      to close the loop on actions and outcomes.
    - >-
      Continuously retrain models with outcome feedback (claims, dealer fixes)
      and monitor drift; A/B test alert thresholds to balance precision and
      recall.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Proactive, population-scale early warning that detects emerging failure
    modes 2–4 weeks earlier than claims data, prioritizes by cost-of-failure
    risk, and routes actionable fixes to dealers — cutting warranty cost per
    unit by $30–$80 in year one and reducing recall exposure with measurable
    precision/recall guarantees.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary cross-OEM failure-mode taxonomy and labeled dataset built from
    multi-OEM pilots, enabling earlier and more precise spike detection than
    single-OEM models; closed-loop linkage of telematics patterns to claim
    outcomes and BOM/lot data; and operational playbooks that drive dealer
    action, not just alerts.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
