leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unbilled scope creep from emails/RFIs/meeting minutes causes revenue
      leakage (often 1–3% of contract value).
    - >-
      Manual change order drafting is slow (1–3 hours per CO) and inconsistent,
      delaying approvals and cash flow.
    - >-
      PMs miss triggers for chargeable work because information is fragmented
      across email, RFIs, plans, and field photos.
    - >-
      Backup packages lack standardized documentation (spec references,
      annotated drawings, T&M tickets), increasing disputes and write‑downs.
    - >-
      Existing project management systems (e.g., Procore/Autodesk) manage change
      events but do not proactively detect scope creep in communications or
      generate priced COs with evidence.
    - >-
      Small/mid contractors lack estimating support during construction for
      rapid CO pricing tied to their specific cost codes and historical
      productivity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Email/RFI/minutes monitoring: Securely ingest Outlook/Gmail, RFI feeds,
      and meeting minutes to detect scope-creep signals (e.g., add/relocate,
      spec changes, after-hours, accelerations).
    - >-
      AI-drafted COs: Auto-generate CO narratives, line items mapped to your
      cost codes, labor/material/equipment quantities derived from templates and
      job history, with configurable OH&P, tax, bonding, and schedule impacts.
    - >-
      Evidence pack: Auto-assemble backup—source emails, RFI/ASI links,
      annotated plan/spec excerpts, T&M tickets, photos, timecards—into
      GC/owner-approved formats (AIA G701, custom forms).
    - >-
      Pricing intelligence: Use your historic rates and regional indices (e.g.,
      RSMeans/1build) to validate pricing; flag anomalies vs past accepted COs.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: Sync to Procore/Autodesk Build change events,
      Sage/QuickBooks job cost, and send for internal approval via
      Teams/Slack/Email before client submission.
    - >-
      Auditability and guardrails: Human-in-the-loop review, versioning, and an
      acceptance likelihood score based on similar CO outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Capture every billable change faster. ChangePilot AI monitors your project
    communications, flags scope creep, and drafts priced, standards-compliant
    change orders with supporting evidence—ready for PM review—so you can
    approve in minutes, not days, and recover 1–3% of contract value previously
    left on the table.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized dataset and template library for drywall/insulation
    change orders, coupled with acceptance-outcome modeling by GC. This yields
    higher detection accuracy and better approval rates than generic CO tools or
    PM platforms. Embedded in everyday PM email, ChangePilot AI surfaces
    chargeable work the moment it appears and drafts GC-specific,
    evidence-backed COs with minimal PM effort.
