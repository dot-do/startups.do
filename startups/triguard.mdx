leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High ticket volumes with high variability in issue types (electrical,
      fluidics, software, applications methods) cause long queues and
      inconsistent routing.
    - >-
      Misclassification at L1/L2 leads to ping‑ponging between product
      lines/regions, increasing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and SLA breaches.
    - >-
      Unnecessary Return Material Authorizations (RMAs) and No‑Fault‑Found (NFF)
      returns drive warranty leakage; NFF rates of 10–25% are common for
      analytical instruments.
    - >-
      Knowledge is fragmented across PDFs, service bulletins, CRM notes, and
      tribal knowledge; technicians struggle to find the right procedure fast.
    - >-
      Field photos/logs/spectra/chromatograms are not consistently captured or
      evaluated, leading to weak evidence for RMA approvals.
    - >-
      New product introductions and firmware updates create spikes in ticket
      volume and knowledge gaps.
    - >-
      Global customer base requires multilingual support and consistent process
      adherence across geographies.
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance and auditability requirements (ISO 9001/13485
      processes, CAPA links) demand traceable decisioning for RMAs and
      escalations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Auto‑triage: Classify incoming tickets by product family, subsystem
      (fluidics, RF, optics, vacuum), symptom code, and severity; route to the
      best queue/agent automatically.
    - >-
      Guided resolution: Generate step‑by‑step fix recommendations grounded in
      OEM manuals, service bulletins, and prior resolved tickets; capture agent
      feedback into the KB.
    - >-
      RMA Guardrail: Require structured evidence (error logs, calibration
      checks, photos, chromatograms/spectra, firmware/version data) before RMA
      approval; provide an NFF risk score and cost impact estimate.
    - >-
      Evidence Pack Builder: Auto‑collect and validate artifacts from CRM
      attachments, device telemetry, or user prompts; highlight missing steps
      required by SOPs.
    - >-
      Decision auditability: Produce a timestamped, immutable explanation of
      triage decisions and RMA approvals/denials for QA and audit.
    - >-
      Closed‑loop learning: Continuously learn from ticket outcomes, depot
      findings, and parts consumed to improve triage accuracy and
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Multilingual support: Ingest and respond across major languages; normalize
      to OEM taxonomies.
    - >-
      Integrations: Out‑of‑the‑box connectors for Salesforce Service
      Cloud/ServiceMax, Oracle, SAP S/4HANA Service, Zendesk, Jira Service
      Management; API/SDK for custom PLM/IoT links.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce MTTR and warranty leakage with AI that auto‑triages tickets,
    prescribes fix steps, and enforces evidence‑based RMA approvals
    purpose‑built for analytical instruments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain‑specific ontology and fault‑tree library for analytical
    instruments, combined with multi‑modal evidence evaluation and an RMA
    guardrail policy engine tuned to warranty/NFF economics—packaged with
    certified CRM/FSM connectors and audited decision trails. Early lighthouse
    deployments create proprietary outcome datasets that improve models and are
    hard for generalist AI vendors to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Service and support leaders at analytical instrument OEMs who need faster,
    consistent resolutions and defensible RMAs.
  problem: >-
    External: High ticket volume, inconsistent triage, and unnecessary RMAs
    causing warranty leakage and SLA risk. Internal: Constant firefighting and
    SME bottlenecks. Philosophical: Customers deserve fast, correct fixes; RMAs
    should be rare, fair, and evidence-backed.
  guide: >-
    We understand regulated, complex instruments and the pressure of uptime,
    compliance, and margins. Purpose-built for NAICS 334516 with authority from
    domain-tuned models, human-in-the-loop review, and audit-ready explanations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ticketing/CRM, KB, device logs, and warranty policies. 2)
    Configure triage intents, RMA criteria, and approval thresholds. 3) Pilot on
    a subset, measure KPIs, then scale across products/regions. Agreement: Data
    stays governed; your team retains final RMA approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and scope a 4-week pilot. Transitional: Get
    the Triage Quality Report template and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Faster MTTR and higher first-contact resolution. Target: 20–40% faster
    resolution, 30–50% fewer unnecessary RMAs. Evidence-backed RMA packets
    (logs, error codes, self-tests, KB citations) and clear audit trails.
    Happier customers and protected margins.
  failure: >-
    Backlogs grow, costs rise, SLAs slip, and RMAs lack defensibility—hurting
    reputation and revenue.
