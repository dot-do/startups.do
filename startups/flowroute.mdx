leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Variant and option complexity in meters/flow devices creates thousands of
      BOM and routing permutations that are manually engineered order-by-order.
    - >-
      Manual translation of CPQ/configurator rules into ERP/PLM BOMs leads to
      errors (5–15% line-level errors observed in audits) and ECO churn.
    - >-
      Order-specific routings are inconsistent, omit calibration/verification
      steps, or miss tooling and test fixtures, causing rework and late orders.
    - >-
      Quote-to-release lead time stretches from hours to days as engineering
      validates every configured order.
    - >-
      Master data duplication across CPQ, PLM, and ERP creates synchronization
      drift; effectivity, revisions, and substitutions are hard to govern at
      scale.
    - >-
      Regulatory and standards constraints (e.g., AWWA/ISO 4064/API for meters)
      are applied inconsistently, jeopardizing compliance and warranty.
    - >-
      Experienced manufacturing engineers hold tribal knowledge; onboarding new
      staff is slow and risky.
    - >-
      Executives lack real-time visibility into configuration-driven load on
      work centers and cost/lead-time impacts.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted conversion of configurator/CPQ rules into production-ready
      variant BOMs and routings using a hybrid approach: rules engine +
      constraint solver + learned patterns from historical orders.
    - >-
      Automated generation of operation sequences including machining, assembly,
      calibration, pressure/leak testing, and certification steps with work
      centers, setup/run times, tooling, and inspection plans.
    - >-
      Two-way connectors to major ERP (SAP, Infor, Epicor, Microsoft Dynamics,
      Oracle NetSuite) and PLM (Siemens Teamcenter, PTC Windchill, Dassault
      3DEXPERIENCE, Autodesk/Arena) for governed release, revisions, and
      effectivity.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review with explainability: highlight why each
      component/operation was selected; confidence scores; redline diffs against
      templates.
    - >-
      Compliance-aware configuration: encode AWWA/ISO/API constraints and
      auto-attach control plans, gauge R&R, and certificates required by
      destination market.
    - >-
      Continuous learning from ECOs and shop feedback to improve selection
      rules, time standards, and routings.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: estimate cost/lead time impact of configuration
      choices; identify bottleneck work centers before release.
    - >-
      Master data health checks: detect duplicate items, missing
      alternates/substitutes, and unsupported option combinations before they
      hit ERP.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn configuration rules into audit-ready, production BOMs and routings in
    minutes—with governed revisions and two-way sync to ERP/PLM—cutting
    engineering effort 60–90% and BOM/routing errors by >80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific rules and routing engine for meters/flow devices with
    prebuilt compliance templates, coupled with certified ERP/PLM/CPQ connectors
    and an explainable AI layer trained on real-world meter
    BOMs/routings—delivering faster accuracy gains than generic PLM rule engines
    or CPQ add-ons.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and manufacturing engineering leaders at totalizing fluid meter
    and counting device OEMs (NAICS 334514) who need sales configurations turned
    into production-ready BOMs and routings—fast and error-free.
  problem: >-
    External: Variant complexity and tribal-rule spreadsheets slow BOM/routing
    release and introduce errors and compliance risk. Internal: Teams are stuck
    reconciling CPQ, engineering, and ERP instead of building instruments.
    Philosophical: Complex meters shouldn’t require heroics to build right the
    first time.
  guide: >-
    We understand regulated, variant-rich instrumentation manufacturing. Our
    Configurator-to-BOM/Routing Generator translates configuration rules into
    validated BOMs and routings and syncs them with your ERP/PLM—built by
    manufacturing and PLM veterans with secure, audit-ready workflows.
  plan: >-
    Ingest rules, options, and constraints; map features to parts, routings, and
    parameters; generate AI-assisted BOMs/routings with cost and time rollups;
    human review and approvals; publish to ERP/PLM and continuously learn from
    changes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and start a pilot with your rules and a
    sample product family. Transitional: Download the integration guide and ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Minutes-to-release for BOMs and routings, fewer ECNs, higher first-pass
    yield, on-time delivery, protected margins, and a single, auditable thread
    from configure to build.
  failure: >-
    Continued delays, order errors, scrap and rework, missed ship dates, audit
    findings, and eroded margins as product variability grows.
