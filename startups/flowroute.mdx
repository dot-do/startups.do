  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers spend 6–12 hours/week per company manually sequencing jobs,
      calling suppliers, and juggling crews; schedules break when weather or
      deliveries slip.
    - >-
      Inefficient routing and poor sequencing create 15–30% wasted drive time
      and idle crew time, increasing overtime and reducing gross margin.
    - >-
      General tools (spreadsheets, generic routing apps) ignore
      flooring-specific constraints: acclimation times, delivery windows,
      substrate/moisture readiness, skill matching (carpet vs. tile vs.
      hardwood), and cure/return trips.
    - >-
      Late deliveries and weather thresholds (temperature/humidity for
      adhesives/finishes) cause last-minute reschedules that ripple across the
      week, hurting on-time performance and customer satisfaction.
    - >-
      Owners lack visibility into true capacity and realistic daily plans,
      leading to under/over-booking and uneven cash flow.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered job sequencing and route optimization that accounts for
      delivery time windows, material acclimation, weather thresholds, crew
      skills, and time-on-site.
    - >-
      Real-time replanning: when a delivery ETA slips or weather crosses
      thresholds, automatically propose feasible swaps and re-routes for the
      day/week.
    - >-
      Crew skill and certification matching (e.g., NWFA hardwood, tile setters)
      and equipment constraints to ensure the right crew is assigned.
    - >-
      Predictive job duration models using historical data by material/room mix
      to set realistic start/finish windows and reduce overtime.
    - >-
      Mobile crew app for turn-by-turn routes, job notes, required
      photos/moisture readings, and instant updates; offline-first for
      basements/new builds.
    - >-
      Supplier and telematics integrations to pull delivery ETAs and live
      vehicle positions, verifying arrivals and improving on-time performance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Flooring-smart scheduling and routing that turns your estimates and
    deliveries into executable daily plans—cutting drive time 15–25%, boosting
    jobs per crew by 0.5–1.0/week, and keeping crews on materials, on time, and
    weather-safe.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A flooring-specific constraint engine and dataset (durations by
    material/room mix, acclimation/cure rules, delivery windows) coupled with
    distributor and ERP integrations that generic routing tools lack—creating
    switching friction via embedded workflows and measurable ROI benchmarks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Flooring contractors and ops managers who want every crew day optimized—more
    installs, less windshield time.
  problem: >-
    External: chaotic schedules, shifting delivery windows, and weather delays;
    Internal: constant fire‑drills and crew frustration; Philosophical: you
    shouldn’t lose margin to logistics instead of craftsmanship.
  guide: >-
    We know flooring ops—multi‑crew, multi‑site, tight deadlines. Our AI
    scheduler is built for flooring, factoring delivery windows, weather, cure
    times, site hours, and crew skills to create reliable, profitable days.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect calendar/CRM and define zones. 2) Set constraints: crew skills,
    product/cure, delivery windows, weather thresholds, site hours. 3)
    Auto‑generate optimal weekly sequence and daily routes. 4) Review, tweak via
    drag‑drop, and dispatch to the crew app. 5) Monitor results; the model
    learns weekly.
  callToAction: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot.
  success: >-
    More completed jobs per week, fewer miles and overtime, on‑time installs
    despite weather, happier crews, predictable days, better reviews, and higher
    profit per truck.
  failure: >-
    Keep bleeding margin to idle time and reroutes, miss deadlines when weather
    or deliveries shift, burn out crews, and frustrate customers with
    last‑minute reschedules.
