  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned spindle, bearing, and toolholder failures on CNC machines lead
      to 8–24+ hours of downtime per incident and $20k–$80k in lost production
      and repair cost per event.
    - >-
      Existing condition monitoring often requires new sensors, capital
      approvals, and machine stoppages; adoption cycles can exceed 6–12 months.
    - >-
      Historian and MES logs (spindle load, vibration, downtime codes) are
      underutilized for early failure detection and root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Maintenance is reactive or calendar-based, causing both catastrophic
      failures and unnecessary over-maintenance of spindles and toolholders.
    - >-
      Inconsistent failure labeling across shifts/plants limits cross-site
      learning and repeatability of reliability improvements.
    - >-
      Plant teams lack leading indicators (2–6 weeks early) tied to actionable
      work orders and verified ROI.
    - >-
      Multi-plant steering/suspension operations need standardized,
      component-specific insights (spindle/bearing/toolholder) rather than
      generic machine monitoring.
  solution:
    - >-
      Zero-install data ingestion: secure API/SFTP ingestion of existing
      historian/MES exports (e.g., spindle load/torque, speed, vibration if
      logged, downtime codes, tool changes).
    - >-
      Automated ETL and asset mapping: normalize tags by controller (Fanuc,
      Siemens, Okuma), align by cycle/part number, and exclude planned
      downtime/shifts.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML: change-point detection, trend drift, spectral
      features (if vibration logged), survival analysis for
      probability-of-failure, and remaining useful life (RUL) regression.
    - >-
      Component-specific models: classifiers tailored to spindle bearings,
      drawbar/toolholder taper, and imbalance/misalignment signatures common in
      steering/suspension machining.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts: early-warning severity score with 2–6 week lead times,
      recommended inspection tasks, and confidence bands.
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflow: create CMMS work orders (Maximo, Fiix, eMaint) and
      reconcile outcomes for continuous model learning.
    - >-
      Dashboards and reports: watchlist by asset/line/site, OEE impact
      attribution, and monthly ROI verification.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2-ready controls, field-level encryption,
      private cloud/VPC deployment, and read-only data access patterns.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict spindle, bearing, and toolholder degradation weeks in advance using
    the historian and MES data you already collect—no on‑site sensors or
    installations, no downtime. Deploy in days, reduce unplanned spindle
    failures by 30–50%, and achieve payback in under 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-plant, labeled dataset and physics-informed models specifically
    tuned for automotive steering/suspension machining—combined with no-sensor,
    no-downtime deployment via existing historian/MES data and deep integrations
    to CMMS. Partnerships with spindle rebuilders provide verified failure
    outcomes that competitors often lack, accelerating model accuracy and ROI.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and maintenance leaders in motor‑vehicle steering & suspension machining
    (e.g., knuckles, hubs, control arms, tie‑rod ends) who must keep spindles,
    bearings, and toolholders healthy while hitting OEE and on‑time delivery.
  problem: >-
    External: sudden spindle/bearing/toolholder degradation causes scrap,
    crashes, and downtime while valuable machine logs sit unused. Internal:
    teams are stuck firefighting and guessing maintenance windows.
    Philosophical: you shouldn’t need new sensors or on‑site installs—your
    existing historian/MES data should prevent failures.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve run high‑volume automotive machining and know IATF 16949
    pressures and the cost of a missed shipment. Authority: vendor‑agnostic
    models learn from load, vibration, and downtime logs to flag anomalies days
    in advance; secure, read‑only workflow proven in Tier‑1 pilots.
  plan: >-
    1) Export existing historian/MES logs (load, vibration, downtime). 2) We map
    assets, baseline behavior, and deliver health scores, RUL estimates, and
    root‑cause alerts. 3) You schedule maintenance before failure and track
    OEE/scrap savings. No sensors, no on‑site install; start with a 2‑week
    pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute data review to qualify a line and start a 2‑week
    pilot. Transitional: request a sample alert pack and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Predictable throughput and higher OEE/Cpk, planned maintenance during
    changeovers, extended spindle life, lower scrap and premium freight,
    audit‑ready traceability, and added capacity without new CapEx.
  failure: >-
    Continued surprise failures, overtime and premium freight, damaged
    tooling/workpieces, missed customer shipments and chargebacks, and eroded
    OEE and morale.
