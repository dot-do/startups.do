leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Local refrigerated carriers face rejected loads and chargebacks due to
      undetected temperature excursions and incomplete documentation.
    - >-
      Dispatchers and drivers lack real-time, route-aware alerts that
      differentiate normal door-open spikes from true risk, leading to alert
      fatigue or missed issues.
    - >-
      FSMA Sanitary Transportation Rule (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart O) requires
      documented temperature control, pre-cool verification, equipment
      sanitation, and training records—most local fleets rely on manual logs or
      disjointed systems.
    - >-
      Many local fleets run mixed or older equipment without built-in
      telematics; retrofits are costly, fragmented, and not tuned to short-haul
      stop/start patterns.
    - >-
      Shippers increasingly demand digital, itemized temperature logs per
      stop/load; carriers struggle to produce audit-ready evidence quickly
      (minutes vs days).
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time, multi-sensor monitoring (air and product-proxy probes, door,
      ambient, GPS) with LTE-M/BLE gateway and store-and-forward for patchy
      coverage.
    - >-
      AI models trained on local stop/start patterns to distinguish door-open
      thermal spikes from compressor/airflow failures; predicts excursions 10–20
      minutes before setpoint breach.
    - >-
      Auto-generated FSMA documentation: pre-cool verification, continuous temp
      logs, chain-of-custody per stop/load, calibration certificates
      (NIST-traceable), and driver training records with 12–24 month retention.
    - >-
      Route-aware dispatch dashboard and mobile app: geofenced trip start/stop,
      per-stop temp summary, exception workflows, and two-click corrective
      actions with timestamped notes/photos.
    - >-
      Integrations: Thermo King/Carrier telematics where available; plug-ins for
      Samsara, Motive, Geotab; APIs/webhooks to TMS/WMS (e.g., McLeod, Trimble,
      Rose Rocket) and shipper portals.
    - >-
      Shipper-facing share links or EDI/portal uploads delivering audit-ready
      “sanitary transportation packet” in under 1 minute after delivery.
    - >-
      Optional remote commands (where supported by OEM telematics) for setpoint
      change, defrost, and start/stop, with policy controls and full audit
      trail.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    End-to-end, hardware-agnostic temperature oversight tuned for local routes
    that prevents spoilage, automates FSMA documentation, and proves compliance
    in under 60 seconds—reducing rejected loads by up to 50% and admin time by
    80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Route-aware predictive models and a labeled dataset specific to short-haul
    cold chain (frequent door events) that rivals do not prioritize, combined
    with turnkey FSMA audit packets and deep OEM/TMS integrations—making us
    drop-in for mixed/older fleets and a de facto standard for shipper-required
    proof.

  character: >-
    Local specialized refrigerated carriers moving perishable loads who need
    in-range temps and proof of FSMA control without babysitting every trailer.
  problem: >-
    External: temperature excursions, multi-stop door openings, traffic delays,
    and manual logs that miss events. Internal: fear of rejected loads,
    chargebacks, audit surprises, and losing shipper trust. Philosophical: food
    safety shouldn’t rely on luck—compliance should be automatic and visible.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of same-day perishable runs. Built by cold-chain
    and compliance engineers, our AI monitor aligns with FSMA recordkeeping,
    integrates with common reefer/telematics data, and turns raw readings into
    clear actions and auditable records.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: link reefer telematics or add sensors; set product ranges and
    FSMA record rules. 2) Configure: define lanes, stops, and alert recipients;
    choose escalation playbooks. 3) Run: we watch every trip in real time,
    notify on excursions, and auto-generate tamper-evident, time-stamped
    compliance reports for each load.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on your busiest lane. Transitional: Download the FSMA
    temperature control checklist for local carriers.
  success: >-
    Loads arrive in spec; fewer claims and chargebacks; drivers get clear,
    timely alerts; dispatchers see trip health at a glance; auditors receive
    complete, searchable records; shippers gain confidence and award more lanes.
  failure: >-
    Spoiled product, rejected loads, fines, stressful audits, lost accounts, and
    endless manual paperwork just to prove you did the right thing.
