leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High loss rates and fraud in rent-to-own and subscription rentals for
      electronics/appliances (3–10% net losses depending on segment) due to
      thin-file consumers and inadequate checks.
    - >-
      Manual underwriting and inconsistent deposit setting lead to slow
      decisions (minutes–hours), low conversion, and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Existing KYC/credit tools are generic ecommerce/credit solutions; they
      don’t translate risk into actionable deposit/term recommendations for
      rentals.
    - >-
      Fragmented data sources (credit bureaus, device blacklists, bank
      transaction data) make integration complex and costly for mid-market and
      SMB merchants.
    - >-
      Regulatory and compliance risk (FCRA/ECOA/adverse action, KYC) increases
      operational burden and legal exposure for merchants.
    - >-
      Limited ability to run real-time A/B tests and monitor portfolio
      performance, causing under- or over-approval and margin leakage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time API and web widget for pre-check: identity/KYC, credit and
      alternative data, fraud signals, and device risk in <1s p95.
    - >-
      Actionable output tailored to rentals: approve/decline/review +
      recommended deposit ($) and contract terms (max ticket, duration, autopay
      frequency).
    - >-
      Configurable decision engine blending ML risk scores with business rules
      (store/location, inventory category, price bands, promo periods).
    - >-
      Merchant portal for case management, overrides, adverse action letters,
      audit logs, and performance dashboards.
    - >-
      A/B testing and continuous learning from repayment/return outcomes;
      automatic policy tuning to target loss and approval goals.
    - >-
      Compliance tooling: FCRA permissible purpose workflows, ECOA/Reg B reason
      codes, KYC/AML checks, PII handling, consent tracking.
    - >-
      Optional open-banking cash-flow verification (bank connect) to boost
      approvals for thin-file applicants.
    - >-
      Device risk integrations: IMEI/serial blacklist, theft databases,
      geofencing, and device-value curves to align deposits with residual value.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, compliant eligibility and deposit/term recommendations that approve
    more good renters and reduce losses—purpose-built for rentals, not loans—via
    an API and merchant portal that combine KYC, credit, and alternative data
    into a single risk decision in under 1 second.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized deposit-and-terms optimizer trained on cross-merchant rental
    outcomes and device residual values, combined with a consortium fraud graph.
    This yields better approval/loss trade-offs than generic KYC/credit tools
    and is reinforced by compliance automation (FCRA/ECOA) and feedback loops
    that competitors without rental data cannot easily replicate.

    friction or fraud.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual checks, blanket rules, and slow KYC/credit reviews cause
    drop-offs, fraud, and charge-offs. Internal: Teams feel stuck between growth
    targets and risk exposure, anxious about compliance and bad debt.
    Philosophical: Access to essential tech should be fair and fast; good
    customers deserve transparent terms and businesses deserve predictable risk.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the daily trade-off between approving more customers
    and preventing losses. Authority: Built by risk and compliance
    practitioners; uses explainable ML, bureau/KYC signals, and auditable
    decisions designed to support regulatory readiness and privacy by default.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect API/SDK and map checkout fields; 2) Set policy
    thresholds (risk score cutoffs, deposit ranges, terms); 3) Launch, monitor
    in dashboard, iterate with A/B policies. Agreement: Transparent pricing,
    data privacy safeguards, explainability on every decision, and responsive
    support.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or request an API key to start a 2-week pilot.
    Transitional: Test the sandbox with sample data and review the risk policy
    playbook.

    Increase approvals for good customers, reduce delinquency and fraud,
    right-size deposits/terms, speed up checkout, improve conversion and LTV,
    and maintain auditable, compliant-ready decisions.
  failure: >-
    Keep losing customers to friction, absorb higher charge-offs and fraud,
    apply unfair declines, invite compliance headaches, and miss growth targets
    due to blunt, manual processes.
