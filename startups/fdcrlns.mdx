  problem:
    - >-
      Manual monitoring of fiduciary, trust, and custody accounts against trust
      instruments, IPS limits, prohibited transaction rules, and concentration
      thresholds is fragmented across spreadsheets, trust systems, and
      OMS/portfolio tools—leading to missed violations and costly exams.
    - >-
      Existing compliance engines focus on investment guidelines or trade
      surveillance, not fiduciary duties (self-dealing, conflicts with
      affiliates, related parties, principal/agent issues, Reg W), or the
      bespoke clauses in trust documents and plan documents.
    - >-
      Regulatory expectations (OCC 12 CFR 9, ERISA §406/407 and PTEs, Uniform
      Prudent Investor Act, SEC Custody Rule) require real-time surveillance,
      auditable evidence, and timely remediation; most firms rely on periodic
      sampling and manual attestations.
    - >-
      Disparate data (accounts, holdings, trades, beneficiaries,
      insiders/affiliates, restricted lists) sits in siloed systems (trust
      accounting, custodians, OMS, CRM/legal), making end-to-end detection of
      prohibited transactions and conflicts difficult.
    - >-
      False positives and inconsistent interpretations of trust/plan documents
      consume compliance hours, slow operations, and create litigation/exam
      risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Document-to-rule engine: NLP parses trust instruments, plan documents,
      IPSs, and internal policies into machine-readable rules with
      human-in-the-loop validation.
    - >-
      Real-time surveillance: Normalize and monitor holdings, cash movements,
      trades, and corporate actions against rules (IPS limits, concentration,
      restricted issuer/affiliate lists, PTE conditions, Reg W, self-dealing).
    - >-
      Conflict and affiliation graph: Link accounts, beneficiaries, trustees,
      insiders, affiliates, and issuers via a knowledge graph (LEI, ownership
      data, CRM/legal) to detect self-dealing and related-party transactions.
    - >-
      Prohibited Transaction Analyzer: Detect ERISA §406/407 issues and map
      potential exemptions (PTE conditions) with automated evidence checklists.
    - >-
      Evidence and audit packs: Auto-generate regulator-ready reports (exception
      timelines, approvals, sign-offs, attestations, lineage) aligned to
      OCC/DOL/SEC expectations.
    - >-
      Workflow and remediation: Case management, SOX-style approvals,
      escalations, compensating control documentation, and automated re-checks
      post-remediation.
    - >-
      Backtesting and simulation: Replay history to quantify past gaps; simulate
      policy changes or trust amendments before go-live.
    - >-
      Deployment and security: Single-tenant VPC or on-prem; data encryption,
      RBAC, SSO/SAML, audit logs; SOC 2 Type II/ISO 27001 controls; model
      governance for explainability and versioning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Translate trust and plan documents into executable, explainable controls and
    continuously surveil holdings and activity for fiduciary duty breaches and
    prohibited transactions—reducing exceptions, audit findings, and legal
    exposure while providing regulator-ready evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, explainable legal-to-logic engine and conflicts knowledge
    graph purpose-built for fiduciary/trust contexts—combining pre-built
    controls mapped to OCC/ERISA/UPIA with deep integrations to trust accounting
    and custody platforms. The proprietary corpus of annotated trust/plan
    documents and validated exception outcomes improves precision/recall over
    generic surveillance or OMS compliance engines. Strong evidentiary outputs
    reduce exam burden and litigation exposure in ways generalist tools cannot.
