  problem:
    - >-
      Manual SPC entry and siloed metrology data create latency (hours to days)
      between measurement and corrective action, causing avoidable scrap/rework.
    - >-
      Process drift and tool wear are detected late; conventional control charts
      miss multivariate and cyclic patterns typical in turning (thermal growth,
      tool nose wear, bar stock lot changes).
    - >-
      Heterogeneous equipment (CMMs, in-process gauges, vision systems,
      handhelds) lacks a unified data layer; integrations are bespoke, brittle,
      and costly to maintain.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (PPAP, IATF 16949, AS9100, ISO 13485) requires
      traceability, Cpk/Ppk evidence, MSA trending, and audit trails—often
      assembled manually for audits.
    - >-
      Skills gap on shop floors means fewer experienced process engineers to
      interpret SPC trends and recommend precise offsets or parameter changes.
    - >-
      Air-gapped or high-security plants need low-latency, on-prem evidence
      generation without shipping proprietary geometry/data to the cloud.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge agent ingests measurement data in real time from CMMs,
      in-process/bench gauges, vision systems, and handhelds; normalizes via
      standards (QIF, DMIS, MTConnect, OPC UA, CSV, serial).
    - >-
      SPC engine computes control charts, Cpk/Ppk, capability by
      feature/lot/machine/operator with automatic subgrouping and rational
      sampling checks.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection models (univariate and multivariate) identify trends,
      cycles, and tool wear signatures; ranks severity and confidence.
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance library for turning recommends offsets (e.g., X/Z
      tool wear comp), tool changes, warm-up cycles, and checks (gage R&R,
      coolant concentration, bar feeder tension).
    - >-
      Closed-loop option writes verified offset changes to supported CNCs under
      e-signature and role-based approval.
    - >-
      Automated alerts (Andon, SMS/Email/Teams/Slack) with evidence packs;
      daily/shift reports for PPAP/APQP, MSA trending, and audit-ready
      traceability.
    - >-
      Cloud or on-prem dashboards for process health, capability by
      part/feature, and ROI tracking; REST API to push results to QMS/MES/PLM.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, vendor-agnostic SPC that auto-ingests measurement streams,
    detects drift and anomalies faster than traditional charts, and translates
    them into prescriptive, machine-ready corrective actions—reducing
    scrap/rework by 20–40% and increasing Cpk to ≥1.33 across critical features
    within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vendor-agnostic, production-hardened connector stack plus a prescriptive
    library specific to turning that closes the loop to CNC offsets under
    governance—validated across multiple OEMs and regulated audits—delivering
    measurable scrap and Cpk improvements within one quarter.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and process leaders in precision turned product manufacturing who
    need real-time SPC, stable processes, and on-time delivery.
  problem: >-
    Manual SPC and siloed gage data create late signals and quality escapes;
    teams feel blind between checks—making good parts shouldn’t depend on luck.
  guide: >-
    We’re SPC and manufacturing data engineers with deep machining experience;
    we understand PPAP pressure, customer scorecards, and tight margins—and
    we’ve helped shops standardize control plans and pass audits.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect measurement streams (CMMs, in‑process gages, vision, lasers). 2)
    Auto‑ingest data to compute Cp/Cpk, SPC charts, and anomaly/drift models. 3)
    Deliver prioritized alerts with recommended corrective actions in your
    workflow.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute demo with your data—or start a pilot on one line this
    week.
  success: >-
    See issues before parts go off‑spec, raise Cpk, cut scrap and rework, speed
    PPAPs, and keep customers confident—operators know what to adjust and when.
  failure: >-
    Without change: more firefighting, mounting scrap and chargebacks, late
    shipments, audit findings, and lost business.

  problem:
    - Manual SPC entry slows lines and hides drift.
    - Late or noisy alerts drive overcorrection and scrap.
    - 'Data scattered across gauges, CMMs, and machines.'
    - Engineers chase trends; operators lack clear next steps.
    - Audits demand traceability you can’t assemble fast.
    - Tool wear and batch variation cause sudden shifts.
    - Scaling quality across cells and shifts is inconsistent.
  solution:
    - 'Auto-ingest measurements from gauges, CMMs, probes, and vision.'
    - 'Compute Cpk/Ppk, Xbar-R, and I-MR per part/rev/feature.'
    - 'AI flags drift, wear, and pattern anomalies early.'
    - 'Clear, ranked corrective actions with expected Cpk lift.'
    - One-click offset recommendations with guardrails and approvals.
    - 'Role-based alerts for operators, QE, and supervisors.'
    - 'Audit-ready e-records with lot, machine, tool, and operator traceability.'
    - Edge or cloud deployment; integrates with MES/ERP/PLM.
  features:
    - 'Plug-and-play connectors: OPC UA, MTConnect, QIF/CSV, serial/USB, API.'
    - Edge agent buffers locally and syncs on reconnect.
    - 'Auto-tag by part, revision, feature, machine, tool, and batch.'
    - Adaptive control limits using golden-run baselines.
    - Outlier scrubbing and measurement validation.
    - Explainable rules plus ML (Western/Nelson + models).
    - Tool-wear and drift prediction before capability drops.
    - Offset and tool-change guidance with approval workflow.
    - Multi-site dashboards and Cpk rollups by cell and shift.
    - Instant SPC/PPAP reports with e-signatures.
    - 'SSO, RBAC, full audit trail; SOC2-ready; 21 CFR Part 11.'
    - 'On-prem, air-gapped, or SaaS options.'
  steps:
    - Connect machines and metrology—no code.
    - Import parts and CTQs; map features to control plans.
    - 'Set limits, rules, and notification policies.'
    - Start streaming; watch live Cpk/SPC dashboards populate.
    - Act on ranked recommendations; apply offsets with approvals.
    - Export reports and sync actions to MES/ERP.
