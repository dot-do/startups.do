  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden leaks waste thousands of gallons per house per flock, driving wet
      litter, higher ammonia, and increased paw and breast blister
      condemnations.
    - >-
      Clogged or partially obstructed drinker lines create uneven water access,
      causing localized stress, uneven weights, and higher mortality on certain
      lines or ends of the house.
    - >-
      Manual checks (walk-throughs, visual litter checks, reading water meters)
      detect issues hours to days late, after performance and welfare impacts
      have occurred.
    - >-
      Existing house controllers show totals but lack intelligent anomaly
      detection that accounts for flock age, temperature, feed delivery, and
      historical baselines.
    - >-
      Veterinary/health events (e.g., coccidiosis, enteritis) manifest first as
      abnormal water-to-feed ratios; growers miss early intervention windows
      without continuous analytics.
    - >-
      Growers and integrators lack quantified, auditable ROI on water-related
      interventions to justify time and capital spend.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive sensor kit per house that leverages existing pulse water
      meters where available; otherwise, add an inline meter and line-pressure
      sensor.
    - >-
      Edge+cloud AI models that learn each house’s normal water profile by flock
      age, time of day, temperature, feed schedule, and ventilation patterns.
    - >-
      Real-time anomaly detection for leaks (>0.2–0.5 L/min sustained) and clogs
      (step-changes or zone imbalances) with confidence scores and root-cause
      suggestions.
    - >-
      Health event flagging when water-to-feed ratios deviate from age-adjusted
      norms (e.g., >2 SD from baseline for >2 hours) prompting early veterinary
      checks.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts via SMS/app/IVR with triage workflows: who checks,
      where, and how, plus in-app photo confirmation and auto-close on
      resolution.
    - >-
      Integrations with major controllers (Rotem, Hotraco, Chore-Tronics,
      Cumberland, SKOV) and farm management systems (e.g., MTech Systems) for
      unified dashboards and reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect and fix water problems before they cost you money: AI that flags
    leaks, clogs, and health-driven anomalies within 15–60 minutes, reducing
    wet-litter days by 30–50%, saving 3–8% water, and improving livability and
    FCR with simple, actionable alerts integrated into existing house
    controllers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-integrator, multi-region dataset of labeled water anomalies and
    outcomes plus physics-informed models deployed at the edge yields earlier,
    more accurate detection than controller-only heuristics. Deep OEM
    integrations reduce install friction, and validated ROI with
    insurer-recognized reports creates a moat via premium credits and enterprise
    stickiness.

  problem: >-
    External problem is undetected leaks clogged drinker lines or sensor gaps
    that hurt welfare and performance. Internal problem is teams forced into
    reactive firefighting and guesswork. Philosophical problem is it should
    never be acceptable to lose birds because water anomalies go unseen.
  guide: >-
    We understand razor thin margins and how water drives health and FCR. Our
    poultry and water system engineers built an AI service proven in broiler
    houses that integrates with existing controllers and meters and delivers
    clear action ready alerts.
  plan: >-
    Step 1 connect data by using your flow meters or controller feeds or add
    simple inline sensors. Step 2 baseline and calibrate where AI learns normal
    by age time weather and line. Step 3 act and verify with ranked alerts fix
    playbooks confirmation of resolution and savings tracking.

    improve FCR and average daily gain cut wet litter and propane use save water
    reduce emergency call outs and gain audit ready records with ROI often under
    one flock.

    title: AI Water Anomaly & Leak Detection for Broiler Houses
    subtitle: >-
      Detect leaks, clogs, and water-intake anomalies in minutes. Cut wet
      litter, losses, and labor across NAICS 112320 operations.
    ctaText: Start 30‑day pilot
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - >-
      Leaks and clogs go unnoticed for hours, wasting water and stressing
      flocks.
    - 'Static thresholds miss age-stage, time-of-day, and weather-driven shifts.'
    - Manual checks are labor-heavy and inconsistent across houses.
    - 'Wet litter raises ammonia, health issues, and condemnation risk.'
    - 'Late detection hurts uniformity, FCR, and mortality.'
    - Device data is siloed; insights arrive too late to act.
  solution:
    - 'Learn normal water patterns by flock age, house, and time of day.'
    - Detect anomalies within minutes and rank severity and confidence.
    - >-
      Classify likely cause: leak, clog, valve/pressure failure, or flock health
      event.
    - Send actionable alerts with precise location and step-by-step checks.
    - 'Integrate with existing meters, controllers, and pressure sensors.'
    - 'Provide dashboards for water-to-feed ratio, intake curves, and trends.'
  features:
    - Minute-by-minute monitoring with adaptive baselines per house and line.
    - Per-line localization to isolate leaks or clogs quickly.
    - Weather- and age-aware models to reduce false alarms.
    - 'SMS, app, and email alerts with escalation and quiet hours.'
    - 'Health signal overlays: intake dips/spikes vs. temperature and activity.'
    - Water-to-feed ratio tracking and early FCR risk flags.
    - 'Wet Litter Risk Index from water, temp, humidity, and airflow signals.'
    - 'Role-based access, multi-farm views, and audit logs.'
    - Works with major flow meters and controllers; simple retrofit kits.
    - Edge gateway with offline buffering and optional cellular backhaul.
    - API and CSV export; scheduled reports after each flock.
    - Multi-language UI and on-farm alert boards for low-connectivity sites.
  steps:
    - Connect meters/controllers to our gateway (1–2 hours per house).
    - Auto-calibrate with 7–10 days of normal operation.
    - Receive real-time alerts with root-cause hints and severity scores.
    - Follow guided checks to fix leaks/clogs or address health events.
    - Review flock reports and savings; refine alert rules as you scale.
