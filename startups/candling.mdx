  problem:
    - >-
      Hatcheries rely on manual candling and small breakout samples (0.5–2% of a
      batch) to estimate fertility and early embryo mortality, leading to
      forecast errors of 3–8%.
    - >-
      Late discovery of low fertility or early mortality increases waste (late
      clears), labor rework, and misaligned chick delivery schedules for
      growers.
    - >-
      Existing machine vision on candling lines primarily detects cracks/leakers
      for table eggs, not embryo viability categories needed by hatcheries.
    - >-
      Forecast uncertainty drives over-setting eggs and suboptimal incubator
      tuning (temperature/turning/ventilation) that reduce hatchability
      0.3–1.0%.
    - >-
      Biosecurity and labor constraints limit frequent manual checks, especially
      on night/weekend shifts, causing delayed intervention.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge computer-vision module installed above existing candling lines or
      sampling stations to classify each egg: clear (infertile), early viable,
      blood ring/early dead, questionable.
    - >-
      Batch-level analytics and rolling hatch forecasts updated after each
      candling pass (e.g., day 0 sampling, day 7, day 10), with variance bands
      and alerts.
    - >-
      API/connector to hatchery management software to align chick delivery
      forecasts and incubator control parameters.
    - >-
      Dashboard for supervisors: fertility %, early mortality %, tray/row
      heatmaps, recommended actions (e.g., advance culling, adjust setpoints).
    - >-
      Continuous model improvement using privacy-preserving feedback
      (human-verified audits, hatch-out reconciliation).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn candling images into accurate, real-time fertility and early mortality
    estimates so hatcheries can optimize set/transfer decisions and deliver
    on-spec chick counts with minimal labor and waste.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking candling imagery with hatch-out
    outcomes across multiple integrators and incubator types, enabling superior
    early mortality detection and forecast accuracy that is hard to replicate;
    reinforced by OEM integration agreements and on-prem, biosecurity-ready edge
    deployment.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Hatchery managers, supervisors, and QA at poultry hatcheries (NAICS 112340)
    who must hit daily chick numbers, reduce waste, and improve predictability.
  problem: >-
    Manual candling is slow and subjective, delaying true fertility and
    early-embryo mortality visibility; batch forecasts drift, causing mis-sets,
    wasted capacity, missed pulls, and volatile chick supply—when decisions
    should be driven by timely, objective data.
  guide: >-
    Candling AI understands hatchery pace and pressure. Our computer vision
    reads candling images/videos to classify fertile, clears, and early dead and
    instantly updates batch forecasts. Built with hatchery partners, validated
    against expert grading, deployable with existing lamps/cameras or phones,
    secure and biosecure.
  plan: >-
    1) Capture candling video/images during routine checks. 2) Send via mobile
    app, API, or on-prem edge device. 3) Receive tray- and batch-level fertility
    and early-mortality estimates with updated HoS/HoF forecasts and clear
    actions. Start with a 2–4 week pilot on one room, then scale.
  callToAction: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot on your next candling pass.
  success: >-
    See fertility and early-dead early and accurately; stabilize chick supply;
    optimize set density and transfers; cut re-candling and breakouts; save
    labor; improve chick yield, uniformity, and customer fill rates with
    traceability across flocks and batches.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing on fertility; over/under-setting and scrambling to fill
    orders; wasted setter/hatcher space; late surprises, higher culls, and
    avoidable early mortality losses.

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual candling is slow and subjective; results vary by operator and
      shift.
    - Infertile and early-dead eggs waste incubator space and utilities.

    - Re-candling and data entry add cost without improving accuracy.
    - 'Limited traceability across flocks, setters, and sites.'
