leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Electricity is 5–15% of conversion costs for plastics processing, and
      demand charges can be 30–60% of the electric bill; manual schedules often
      create avoidable peaks.
    - >-
      Schedulers optimize for due dates and utilization, not real-time tariffs
      or demand charges; TOU and RTP price signals are rarely embedded in
      dispatch decisions.
    - >-
      Machine constraints (mold changeovers, color contamination, dryer
      availability, cure/heat-up times, qualified labor) make energy-aware
      scheduling complex and error-prone.
    - >-
      Uncoordinated start-ups (presses, extruders, dryers, chillers) produce
      short, expensive demand spikes that lock in high demand charges for the
      month.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of true cost-to-serve per job (kWh/unit, $/unit)
      prevents margin-based prioritization.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MES APS modules are not energy-aware; plants resort to
      spreadsheets and tribal knowledge leading to missed due dates or higher
      scrap when attempting load shifting.
    - >-
      Inability to reliably participate in utility demand response or peak
      shaving without risking OTD or quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven APS that co-optimizes due dates, changeovers, labor, and machine
      constraints with tariffs, demand charges, and DR events.
    - >-
      Digital twin of the shop floor (machines, molds, dryers, utilities, labor
      pools) and a constraint-based optimizer that runs continuously and
      re-plans as conditions change.
    - >-
      Tariff-aware dispatching: automatically staggers high-draw equipment
      during peak windows; pre-heats/pre-dries outside peak; sequences
      color/mold families to minimize changeover and scrap.
    - >-
      Peak shaving: monitors real-time kW, predicts 15–60 min ahead, and adjusts
      starts/pauses to avoid crossing demand thresholds.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: planners compare delivery, energy cost, and OEE across
      alternative schedules before committing.
    - >-
      MES/ERP integration (Epicor/DELMIAWorks, Infor, SAP, Plex, etc.) plus
      OPC-UA/Kepware connectors to machine PLCs for status, load, and energy
      proxies.
    - >-
      Automated reporting of kWh/unit and $/order for margin analytics and
      sustainability disclosures (Scope 2).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce electricity cost 8–15% and monthly peak demand 10–25% while
    maintaining ≥95% on-time delivery by making your press/machine schedule
    energy-aware—no new hardware, ROI in 3–6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A plastics-specific, energy-aware APS with pre-built color/changeover
    templates, tariff and demand-charge modeling, and connectors to common
    plastics ERPs/MES—validated by plant-level case studies and a growing
    cross-plant dataset that improves peak prediction and sequencing over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant/operations manager at a plastics plumbing fixture manufacturer (NAICS
    326191) who must hit due dates, control energy spend, and keep
    presses/extruders utilized without chaos.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile TOU rates and demand charges plus manual schedules create
    costly peaks, overtime, and missed ship dates. Internal: Constant
    firefighting and limited visibility. Philosophical: Making the same parts
    shouldn’t cost more just because of timing—energy should be planned, not
    endured. Villain: Spiky electricity prices and rigid legacy scheduling.
  guide: >-
    We’re energy-aware scheduling experts for plastics. We understand molds,
    resins, colors, cycle times, tooling limits, and changeovers. Our AI has cut
    energy costs 10–20% while protecting service levels and integrates with
    ERP/MES so you stay in control.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: jobs, press/extruder limits, tariffs, maintenance, and
    shifts. 2) Optimize: generate a cost-minimizing schedule that honors due
    dates and constraints; scenario test and approve. 3) Run and refine: publish
    to the floor, track peaks, and adjust in minutes. Pilot in 2 weeks with low
    risk.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 14-day pilot with your real jobs.
    Transitional: Download a case study and use the savings calculator.
  success: >-
    10–20% lower energy spend, fewer demand peaks and penalties, higher on-time
    delivery, smoother shifts and changeovers, reduced scrap and overtime,
    verified CO2 reductions, and stronger margins per part.
  failure: >-
    Overpay for power, trigger demand spikes, scramble schedules, miss due
    dates, burn overtime and resin, and lose margin to competitors using
    energy-optimized scheduling.
