leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      MTRs arrive as heterogeneous PDFs/photos from dozens of mills and service
      centers, forcing 100% manual data entry (10–20 minutes/MTR) and review by
      receiving/QA staff.
    - >-
      Spec nonconformance (chemistry/mechanical/grade mismatches) is often
      caught late; lack of automated checks leads to scrap/rework, line stops,
      and audit findings.
    - >-
      Heat numbers are inconsistently linked to POs, inventory lots, and job
      travelers in ERP; gaps in traceability jeopardize ISO
      9001/ASME/pressure-vessel/customer compliance.
    - >-
      Documents are stored in shared drives or as ERP attachments without
      structured data, making audits slow (1–3 days prep per audit) and Root
      Cause Analysis difficult.
    - >-
      Duplicate/incorrect MTRs from suppliers (mis-tagged heats, missing heat
      treat data) go unnoticed; manual reconciliation across receivers, MTRs,
      and certs is error-prone.
    - >-
      Current generic OCR tools fail on low-quality scans, stamps/handwritten
      fields, and multi-page MTR packets; extraction accuracy below 85% causes
      low straight-through processing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel MTR ingestion (email dropbox, SFTP, supplier portal upload,
      mobile capture) with deduping and document classification by
      supplier/mill/template.
    - >-
      AI-powered OCR tuned for MTRs (tables, stamps, logos, watermarks, skew)
      extracting: heat number(s), grade/standard, chemistry tables, mechanical
      properties, dimensions, PO/line/receiver, supplier/mill, heat treat, lot
      size, test methods.
    - >-
      Spec rules engine maps extracted data to required specs (ASTM/ASME/API/EN)
      from the job/part BOM; validates chemistry ranges, mechanical minima,
      grade equivalence, and test method requirements.
    - >-
      Traceability reconciliation: link heat numbers to PO receipts, inventory
      lots, and job travelers in the ERP; auto-generate/print barcode labels
      with heat/lot references.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: queue for human review with side-by-side document
      viewer, confidence scoring, suggested corrections, and push-back to
      supplier when MTR is invalid/missing.
    - >-
      ERP connectors (JobBOSS², E2 Shop, Epicor Kinetic, Global Shop Solutions,
      Infor VISUAL, ProShop, Odoo, SAP B1, Plex) via APIs/flat files to
      create/update lots, attach certs, and write validated properties.
    - >-
      Audit pack generator: one-click consolidation of MTRs, heat-to-job
      chain-of-custody, and spec verification logs for a job, PO, or customer
      audit scope.
    - >-
      Analytics & alerts: nonconformance trends by supplier/material, release
      lead time, STP rate, and heat consumption across jobs for FIFO/FEFO
      enforcement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate MTR intake-to-ERP traceability with mill-grade OCR and a spec rules
    engine that flags nonconformances in real time—reducing release lead time by
    70%, eliminating data-entry labor, and making audits one-click.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary library of MTR templates and spec-rule validations
    tied to real ERP data, enabling high STP and low false positives that
    generic OCR cannot match—plus turnkey ERP connectors and audit-pack

  character: >-
    Quality and operations leaders at fabricated metal product manufacturers
    (NAICS 332999) who need ironclad material traceability without slowing
    production.
  problem: >-
    MTRs arrive as scans/PDFs; manual entry is slow and error-prone; heat
    numbers don’t consistently tie to inventory and jobs; spec compliance is
    hard to verify; audits and customer CoCs stall—risking NCRs, rework, and
    lost credibility.
  guide: >-
    We understand audit pressure and messy multi-vendor paperwork. Our team
    builds shop-floor quality software; our AI reads MTRs, validates against
    ASTM/ASME/SAE specs, and reconciles heat numbers across your ERP so you can
    trust every traceability link.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/inventory and spec library. 2) Ingest MTRs via email, watch
    folder, or portal; AI OCRs, normalizes mill data/alloys, and validates
    chemistry/mechanicals/tolerances. 3) Auto-link heats to inventory lots and
    job travelers; route exceptions for review; sync results back to ERP and
    CoCs.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot using your actual MTRs.
  success: >-
    Audit-ready traceability in minutes, automatic CoC generation, fewer NCRs
    and chargebacks, faster job release, lower MTR handling cost, confident spec
    compliance, and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning hours on data entry, miss heat-to-job links, scramble during
    audits, risk nonconformance, rework, late shipments, and lost contracts.
