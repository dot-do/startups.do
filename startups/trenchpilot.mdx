  risks:
    - Existing utility data may be outdated/incomplete

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual utility conflict reviews are slow (1–2 weeks) and error-prone,
      causing missed conflicts, RFIs, and utility strikes that can cost $5k–$50k
      per hit plus schedule impacts.
    - >-
      Site prep crews often lack constructible trenching plans (sequence,
      shoring, protection, traffic control), leading to field improvisation,
      unsafe practices, and rework.
    - >-
      Existing data (PDF plans, CAD, municipal GIS, 811 marks, SUE) is
      fragmented and poorly aligned, making overlays labor-intensive and
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      Small/mid-size contractors lack in-house VDC/GIS capacity; outsourcing to
      engineers is costly and too slow for bid/precon timelines.
    - >-
      Liability concerns push contractors to over-buffer schedules; lack of
      proactive clash detection increases change orders and delays during
      mobilization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest PDFs/DWGs of proposed work and available existing utility data
      (SUE, 811 marks, municipal GIS, as-builts), auto-georeference and classify
      utilities by type and quality level (ASCE 38-22).
    - >-
      AI-driven clash detection highlights horizontal/vertical conflicts,
      encroachments, easement violations, and clearance non-compliance with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Automated trench plan drafting: recommended sequence by utility, depth,
      traffic control phasing, and access; shoring/shielding suggestions aligned
      to OSHA Subpart P; spoil placement and restoration notes.
    - >-
      Deliverables: Annotated conflict report (PDF), geospatial overlay
      (GeoPackage), DWG layers, and a Gantt-style trench sequence; optional
      method statements and submittal templates.
    - >-
      Field-ready change workflow: mobile review, redlines, and rapid re-runs as
      designs update; integrations with Procore, Autodesk Build, and Navisworks
      for coordination.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    mobilization.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
