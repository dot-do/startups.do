leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow and error-prone intake triage: 2–5 business days to turn RFQs into
      test plans/quotes; manual SME review for 70–90% of RFQs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent method selection: 8–15% of test plans contain misapplied or
      outdated standards, driving rework and nonconformances (NCRs).
    - >-
      Quote win-rate loss: 10–20% lower win-rate due to delayed responses vs.
      competitors; lack of standardization across sites/teams.
    - >-
      High SME load: Technical managers spend 20–40% of time on repetitive
      mapping (ASTM/ISO/IEC/EPA/USP), limiting throughput and billable
      utilization.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: Missing required QC/QA steps (blanks, spikes, controls)
      and acceptance criteria; audit findings and CAPAs increase costs/time.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems: RFQs arrive via email/portals and are manually
      re-entered in CRM/LIMS; duplicate data entry causes 5–10% admin waste.
    - >-
      Knowledge silos: Standards and tribal knowledge live in PDFs and senior
      staff; onboarding new hires to triage takes 6–12 months.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven intake parser ingests emails, portals, PDFs, and BOM/spec
      sheets; extracts sample attributes, product type, geography, regulatory
      scope.
    - >-
      Method/standard recommender maps samples to applicable test methods
      (ASTM/ISO/IEC/USP/EPA, FCC/CE/REACH/RoHS/MIL-STD) with clause-level
      citations and regional applicability.
    - >-
      Automated draft test plan including sample prep, equipment, environmental
      conditions, QC/QA controls (blanks, spikes, calibrations), and acceptance
      criteria.
    - >-
      Risk and coverage scoring: highlights ambiguities, missing info, and
      conflicting requirements; suggests clarifying questions for the customer.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI: SMEs approve/modify recommendations; edits
      feed active learning to improve model performance over time.
    - >-
      Quote builder integration: outputs structured BoM, time estimates, and
      pricing inputs; pushes to CRM/LIMS to eliminate re-entry.
    - >-
      Knowledge graph/ontology of methods: versioned mapping across standards,
      crosswalks (ASTM↔ISO/EN/IEC), and deprecated methods notifications.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: on-prem/VPC options, SOC 2 and ISO 27001 roadmap,
      full audit log of every recommendation and change.
    - >-
      Content handling: leverages customer-licensed standards and metadata;
      stores citations/snippets only to respect SDO copyrights.
    - >-
      Multilingual support (EN first; DE/FR/ZH/JP next) for global labs and
      regional regulations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFQ-to-test-plan time by 50–80% with audit-ready, standards-cited
    recommendations that integrate with your LIMS/CRM, improving win rates and
    reducing NCRs—without exposing proprietary data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continually updated method/standards ontology fine-tuned on
    multi-vertical lab data with clause-level citations, reinforced by
