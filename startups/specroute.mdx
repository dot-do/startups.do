  problem:
    - >-
      RFIs and submittals are manually triaged and routed, consuming hours of
      PM/PE and architect time per week and introducing delays when misrouted or
      stalled.
    - >-
      Response quality varies; incomplete context and non-standard templates
      produce back-and-forth, rework, and claims exposure.
    - >-
      Turnaround times are slow (often 5–14 days) and unpredictable, impacting
      schedule and cash flow; escalations are ad hoc and lack auditability.
    - >-
      Existing platforms (Procore, ACC, Newforma, Aconex) manage workflow but do
      not reliably draft high-quality responses tied to current specs/drawings,
      nor do they contextualize items with references automatically.
    - >-
      Teams lack actionable analytics on bottlenecks, duplicate RFIs, and risk
      hotspots; owners and CMs lack portfolio-level visibility into cycle-time,
      compliance to SLAs, and downstream cost/schedule impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Intake and triage: Parse emails, PDFs, and platform records; classify item
      type (RFI, submittal, revision, resubmittal), detect duplicates, map to
      CSI MasterFormat and discipline.
    - >-
      Context assembly: Retrieve relevant contract docs, specs, sheets,
      referenced RFIs/submittals, meeting minutes, and correspondence; highlight
      conflicts and prior decisions.
    - >-
      Draft generation: Create structured, standards-compliant suggested
      responses (AIA/ConsensusDocs style) with citations to specs/sheets/detail
      callouts and unresolved questions clearly flagged.
    - >-
      Routing and SLA engine: Apply project- and company-level rules to assign
      reviewers, set due dates based on contract, and automate escalations and
      reminders.
    - >-
      Approval and logging: In-app or in-platform review with tracked edits,
      reason codes, risk tags, and a full audit trail synchronized back to the
      source system.
    - >-
      Analytics: Portfolio and project dashboards for cycle time, bottlenecks,
      duplicate rate, out-of-SLA items, and projected risk impact on
      schedule/cost.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFI and submittal turnaround time by 40–60% with audit-ready,
    spec-grounded drafts and automatic routing in your existing tools (Procore,
    Autodesk Construction Cloud, Newforma). Human-in-the-loop guardrails
    maintain professional control and liability posture while delivering
    measurable schedule and labor savings.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of adjudicated RFIs/submittals with
    spec/sheet citations and edit telemetry, enabling higher-quality drafts and
    routing than generic AI. Deep, certified integrations into the dominant AEC
    platforms and a liability-aware, standards-compliant drafting framework
    reduce buyer risk and switching friction.

  character: >-
    GC/CM project managers, project engineers, design managers, and owners’ reps
    on commercial and institutional builds who must move RFIs and submittals
    fast and accurately.
  problem: >-
    External: High volume RFIs/submittals arrive across platforms; routing is
    unclear; status tracking is manual; context is buried in
    specs/drawings/addenda; responses are inconsistent.

    Internal: Teams feel underwater and worry about missing critical details,
    schedule slips, and blame.

    Philosophical: Builders should build—not babysit inboxes. Information should
    reach the right expert automatically, with a clear record.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the schedule pressure, coordination complexity, and
    claim risk tied to slow or ambiguous RFI and submittal responses.

    Authority: Built for construction workflows with human-in-the-loop review,
    traceable citations to contract documents, and secure, auditable logging
    that supports common AIA/ConsensusDocs-style processes.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Link your project email and construction platform (e.g.,
    Procore/Autodesk Build/Newforma) and shared drives.

    2) Configure: Ingest specs, drawings, ASIs, addenda, contracts, logs; set
    routing rules, approval thresholds, and vocabularies.

    3) Triage + Draft: The agent classifies items, adds context and citations,
    suggests reviewers, and drafts responses/submittal comments.

    4) Review + Publish: Humans approve, route, and send; updates sync back with
    a complete audit trail.
