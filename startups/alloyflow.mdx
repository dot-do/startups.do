  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers at nonferrous rolling/drawing/extrusion plants spend 4–8
      hours/day manually building Gantt charts in Excel or generic APS tools
      that don’t capture die/tool conflicts, sequence-dependent changeovers, or
      heat-treat dependencies.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent setups (alloy/diameter/profile/temper) cause 10–25% of
      capacity to be lost to unnecessary changeovers due to poor batching and
      campaign planning.
    - >-
      Die/tool availability, tool life, and furnace capacity/recipes (solution
      treat/age/anneal) are not modeled together, causing schedule breaks,
      requeues, and missed due dates (OTD often <80%).
    - >-
      Lack of finite capacity scheduling across presses/mills/benches/ovens
      leads to WIP pileups, underfilled furnace loads, and 5–10 percentage
      points of lost furnace utilization.
    - >-
      Expedites, overtime, and premium freight due to schedule volatility add
      1–3% of COGS and erode margins.
    - >-
      Existing APS/MES modules require heavy customization and don’t provide
      fast what‑if simulation and order promise (CTP) for complex
      alloy/tool/heat-treat constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Purpose-built optimization engine that models sequence-dependent setups,
      die/tool life/availability, alternative routings, lot splitting/merging,
      and heat-treat recipes/ovens as one problem.
    - >-
      Hybrid solver: MILP/CP core (e.g., Gurobi/OR-Tools) plus ML models to
      predict setup/processing times by alloy/profile and to estimate lateness
      risk.
    - >-
      Rolling, drawing, extrusion campaign optimization to minimize changeovers
      while meeting due dates and certification batching rules (e.g., NADCAP lot
      integrity).
    - >-
      Finite-capacity heat-treat scheduling: batch formation by recipe, load
      balancing across furnaces, soak time adherence, quench constraints, and
      aging windows.
    - >-
      Real-time dispatch and dynamic rescheduling using shop-floor signals
      (MES/IoT) for breakdowns, die pulls, and scrap events.
    - >-
      What‑if sandbox and CTP: simulate rush orders, alternate routings, tool
      swaps, or overtime; quote realistic promise dates and costs.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common ERPs/MES (SAP, Infor, Epicor, QAD, Siemens
      Opcenter, DELMIA Apriso); secure cloud or on‑prem.
    - >-
      Scheduler workbench UI: interactive Gantt, heat maps for die/furnace
      conflicts, KPI dashboards, and automated schedule publish to work centers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Finite-capacity, domain-specific APS that simultaneously schedules
    presses/mills/benches and heat-treat with die/tool constraints—reducing
    changeovers 10–25%, improving on‑time delivery 15–30 points, and lifting
    furnace utilization 5–10 points within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A prebuilt, validated constraint library for nonferrous
    rolling/drawing/extrusion and heat-treat (including NADCAP-like batching
    rules) plus historical benchmarks that cut time-to-value to <8 weeks;
    combined OR+ML models tuned on specialty alloy plants, not generic APS.

  character: >-
    Ops, planning, and plant leaders at nonferrous (non-Cu/Al) rolling, drawing,
    and extrusion mills who must hit promise dates while balancing presses,
    mills, benches, dies, and heat-treat capacity.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile mix and metallurgical routes collide with finite
    capacity, changeover matrices, die/tool readiness, and batch heat-treat
    windows.

    - Internal: Planners firefight with spreadsheets and tribal knowledge;
    schedules churn, resources idle or overload, due dates slip.

    - Philosophical: High-value alloys shouldn’t be scheduled like
    guesswork—every order deserves a reliable, constraint-aware plan.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the chaos of late changes, die conflicts, and oven
    bottlenecks that ripple across presses and benches.

    - Authority: Built by ex-plant schedulers and OR/AI PhDs; proven in metals
    with measurable gains (e.g., higher OTIF, lower WIP, fewer expedites).
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan: 1) Connect ERP/MES and routings, dies, and ovens; 2)
    Calibrate constraints and changeover logic; 3) Go live with
    planner-in-the-loop optimization and real-time replan.

    - Agreement Plan: Pilot in 4–8 weeks; keep existing systems (no
    rip-and-replace); clear success criteria (OTIF, WIP, changeovers); easy
    rollback and ownership of your data.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a discovery workshop and launch a plant pilot.

    - Transitional: Get the scheduling ROI calculator and a case study; test a
    sandbox with one month of your orders.
  success: >-
    - A finite-capacity schedule that respects changeovers, die/tool life, and
    heat-treat dependencies across presses/mills/benches.

    - Higher OTIF and throughput; lower WIP, overtime, and premium freight.

    - Stable, explainable plans with fast what-if and disruption recovery.

    - Confident promise dates; improved OEE and margin; metallurgical compliance
    by design.
  failure: >-
    - Continued firefighting: late orders, hot changes, excess changeovers, oven
    and die conflicts.

    - Over/underutilized assets, overtime, premium freight, and scrap risk.

    - Unstable plans erode customer trust and margin.

      dependencies—to boost OTD, throughput, and schedule stability.

  problem:
    - Spreadsheet planning can’t handle finite capacity or secondary ops.
    - >-
      Unbalanced loads across presses, mills, and draw benches cause idle time
      and overtime.
    - >-
      Heat‑treat bottlenecks break promised dates and create last‑minute

    - Frequent changeovers and die swaps inflate lost time and scrap risk.
    - >-
      Tool life, availability, and maintenance windows aren’t visible in the
      plan.
    - Complex routes (press → draw → anneal → draw) are hard to synchronize.
    - 'ERP dates ignore real constraints, driving expedites and WIP pileups.'
    - Quality holds and rework loops derail static schedules.
    - Energy peaks from poorly packed furnace loads raise cost.
    - Limited “what‑if” capability makes decision‑making slow and risky.
