  problem:
    - >-
      High early-life churn: 8–12% monthly churn in months 2–3 for many
      supplement subscriptions; most cancellations cite “too much product,”
      “forgot to take,” “didn’t feel results,” or cost.
    - >-
      Generic lifecycle campaigns underperform: non-segmented flows deliver
      <1.2x ROAS on retention offers and raise unsubscribe/spam complaints.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into churn risk: operators lack predictive scoring tied
      to subscription cadence, inventory-on-hand, and expected time-to-results,
      leading to mistimed messages.
    - >-
      Compliance friction: fear of FDA/FTC violations and TCPA/GDPR/CASL
      constraints makes brands avoid proactive outreach or overuse discounts.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling: churn signals live across Shopify/Recharge,
      Klaviyo/Postscript, support tools, and shipping—no unified action layer to
      test and prove incremental impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Subscriber-level churn risk scoring using behavioral, transactional, and
      support signals; updated daily.
    - >-
      Automated, compliant playbooks: education drips by product category and
      time-to-results, dosage timing nudges, delivery cadence edits, skip/pause
      flows, and right-size bundle suggestions via email/SMS.
    - >-
      Compliant offer engine: dynamic incentives with guardrails (no disease
      claims, built-in disclaimers, TCPA/CAN-SPAM/GDPR logic, opt-in
      management).
    - >-
      Uplift measurement with holdouts and CUPED/causal inference to prove
      incremental retained revenue and margin.
    - >-
      Pre-built integrations: Shopify, Recharge, Klaviyo, Postscript, Attentive,
      Twilio, Gorgias/Zendesk, Stripe; 1-day onboarding for common stacks.
    - >-
      Operator cockpit: reasons-for-churn taxonomy, content templates by
      category (e.g., probiotics: 2–4 weeks to feel effects), model
      explainability, and tests queue.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware timing: align nudges with estimated days-of-supply and
      shipment ETA to prevent overstock churn.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce subscriber churn 20–35% within 90 days using AI churn scoring and
    compliant education, dosage timing, and plan-change automations that align
    with supplement physiology and subscription cadence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific models, playbooks, and compliance guardrails tailored to
    supplements (time-to-results, dosage timing, and claim constraints), plus a
    curated education content library and reason-code explainability that
    generalist retention tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Health supplement retailers running subscriptions who want predictable
    recurring revenue and loyal, healthier customers who stick with their plan.
  problem: >-
    Churn silently erodes MRR as subscribers forget doses, doubt efficacy, or
    change routines—teams lack timely signals and compliant ways to intervene.
  guide: >-
    We understand the tightrope between retention and compliance; our AI
    predicts churn risk and reasons, then uses compliance-friendly, on-label
    education to build trust and keep customers engaged.
  plan: >-
    Connect your store, subscription, and messaging tools
    (Shopify/Recharge/Klaviyo/SMS); AI scores risk and reasons; auto-run
    compliant education offers, dosage timing tips, or plan changes via
    email/SMS; track churn and LTV lift in a live dashboard.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 14-day pilot to get your churn-risk report and switch on a
    high-impact retention flow.
  success: >-
    Reduce churn 15-30%, increase LTV, stabilize MRR, improve adherence and
    satisfaction, and give your team automated retention that scales
    compliantly.
  failure: >-
    Without this, churn stays high, reactivation costs rise, ad spend and CAC
    are wasted, forecasting suffers, and compliance concerns keep you from
    proactive retention.
