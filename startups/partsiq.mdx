  problem:
    - >-
      Techs and counter staff spend 4–10 minutes per lookup across multiple OEM
      portals; peak-season delays cause lost sales and long lines.
    - >-
      Frequent model/serial errors (missing spec/type numbers, wrong year,
      superseded SKUs) drive 10–20% wrong-part returns and rework.
    - >-
      No unified view of availability and price across distributors (Rotary,
      Stens, Oregon, Gardner, Power Distributors, OEMs), leading to stockouts
      and phone time.
    - >-
      Quote follow-up is manual; 30–50% of quotes never get a response and
      customers price-shop online.
    - >-
      Training seasonal staff on dozens of IPLs and portals is slow; service
      levels vary by employee experience.
    - >-
      Duplicate data entry into DMS/POS/CRM and payment systems adds 1–3 minutes
      per ticket and introduces errors.
    - >-
      After-hours inquiries pile up; customers expect instant answers via
      SMS/email with a pay link.
  solution:
    - >-
      Model/serial capture: OCR/vision reads dataplate photos and decodes engine
      spec/type/code to the right IPL and serial range.
    - >-
      Symptom-to-part mapping: AI suggests likely failure/maintenance parts
      (with confidence scores) from curated rules plus learned patterns across
      brands.
    - >-
      Unified availability/pricing: Real-time feeds from major distributors and
      OEM portals; blends local inventory, preferred distributor, and ship ETA.
    - >-
      Pricing engine: Dealer-configurable rules (cost-plus, MAP, min margin,
      brand/channel exceptions) and automatic supersession handling.
    - >-
      One-click quotes: Auto-generated quote with line-item parts, alternates,
      labor notes, taxes, and shop fees; sends via SMS/email with secure pay
      link.
    - >-
      Payments and order routing: Collect deposit or full payment; push order to
      DMS/POS; auto-create pick tickets/POs by source (stock vs distributor).
    - >-
      Add-ons and bundles: Suggest consumables (air filter, plug, oil, blades,
      shear pins, belts) and required gaskets/seals to reduce comebacks.
    - >-
      Audit and training: Save lookup trails, diagrams, and notes; use as
      training wheels for new staff; export to work orders and customer records.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn model/serial/symptom into an accurate, priced parts list and a
    pay-to-order quote in under 60 seconds—reducing returns by 30% and lifting
    quote-to-order conversion by 15–25%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-OEM, serial-range-aware catalog with proprietary symptom-to-part
    intelligence and dataplate OCR—continuously improved by dealer feedback and
