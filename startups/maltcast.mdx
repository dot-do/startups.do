  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly customer demand is volatile (promotions, seasonality, product mix
      shifts) causing frequent stockouts of critical SKUs and overstock in slow
      movers.
    - >-
      Barley procurement and quality are seasonal and variable; misaligned
      demand signals lead to over-contracting or spot buys at premium prices.
    - >-
      Existing forecasting is in spreadsheets or generic tools; lacks
      SKU-by-customer granularity, uncertainty bands, and bias control,
      resulting in poor service (OTIF < 95%) and high working capital.
    - >-
      S&OP is monthly while execution issues are weekly; planners cannot
      translate consensus plans into actionable weekly schedules and safety
      stocks per site/SKU/customer.
    - >-
      Production constraints (kiln/germination capacity, silo availability,
      packaging line changeovers) are not embedded in demand planning, leading
      to plan churn and overtime.
    - >-
      Energy-intensive kilning peaks when plans are unstable, increasing energy
      cost/ton and CO2 per ton of malt.
    - >-
      Lack of early-warning for large account mix changes (macro brewers,
      distillers) and new product introductions leads to reactive firefighting
      and expedites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration from ERP/MES/WMS (orders, shipments, open POs,
      capacities) plus external signals (beer/distilling demand indices,
      holidays, promotions where available).
    - >-
      Hierarchical forecasting at Customer x SKU x Ship-from with probabilistic
      outputs (e.g., P10/P50/P90) and calibrated bias control.
    - >-
      Automated safety stock and reorder point recommendations by
      site/SKU/customer, factoring lead times, demand variability, and service
      targets per customer tier.
    - >-
      S&OP-to-S&OE alignment: Convert monthly consensus demand to weekly
      buckets, reconcile to plant capacities, and surface exceptions for
      planners.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: Simulate major account changes, promo spikes,
      crop/quality constraints, lead-time shifts, and energy price scenarios.
    - >-
      Procurement alignment: Translate demand ranges into barley contracting
      curves and call-off calendars; track coverage and exposure by
      spec/variety.
    - >-
      Early warning and exception management: Alerts for forecast error spikes,
      service risk, capacity bottlenecks, and aging inventory risk.
    - >-
      Closed-loop MLOps: Continuous model monitoring (WAPE/bias/FVA), A/B
      testing of model variants, and override governance with audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Probabilistic SKU-by-customer weekly forecasts and safety stock
    recommendations purpose-built for malt, aligning demand, production, and
    barley procurement to lift OTIF to 98%, cut finished-goods inventory 10–20%,
    and reduce expedites 20–40% within 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized malt ontology and feature library (spec equivalence,
    kiln/germination constraints, barley quality-to-yield models), prebuilt
    ERP/MES connectors, and reference results from leading maltsters
    demonstrating measurable OTIF and inventory gains—with governance that
    quantifies override bias and FVA at SKU-customer level.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    S&OP leads and demand planners at malt manufacturers who need trustworthy
    weekly SKU–customer forecasts to align production and barley contracting
    while protecting OTIF.
  problem: >-
    Brewer/distiller orders swing with seasonality and promotions; the
    SKU–customer mix is complex; long barley lead times and constrained
    germination/kilning capacity create stockouts or bloated inventory;
    spreadsheet forecasts lack uncertainty, forcing firefighting.
  guide: >-
    We’re an AI forecasting partner with malt-domain expertise. We fuse your
    orders, shipments, and promotions with external signals to deliver
    probabilistic weekly forecasts and safety stocks planners can trust—built
    for S&OP alignment.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/WMS data and map SKU–customer demand; baseline accuracy audit
    in 2 weeks. 2) Calibrate service levels; generate weekly probabilistic
    forecasts with uncertainty bands and safety-stock targets; validate with
    planners. 3) Automate weekly drops and S&OP packs for production, packaging,
    and barley procurement, with alerts for risk and upside.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute assessment to see sample forecasts on your history, then
    run a 6–8 week pilot on priority SKUs/customers.
  success: >-
    15–30% SKU–customer accuracy lift; 5–12% inventory reduction with maintained
    service; fewer expedites; higher plan adherence; smarter barley contracting;
    confident, data-driven S&OP.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing demand, over/under‑contract barley, carry dead stock, pay rush
    freight, miss OTIF, and burn out planners with last‑minute changes.
