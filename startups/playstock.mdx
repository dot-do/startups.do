leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts on hot releases and evergreen SKUs (e.g., new TCG sets,
      Lego, Asmodee hits) leading to 2–6% lost sales during peak windows.
    - >-
      Chronic overstock on slow-moving SKUs tying up 10–25% excess working
      capital and driving markdowns.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone PO creation that consumes 4–10 hours/week/buyer;
      reorders often ignore case packs, MOQs, budgets, and lead-time
      variability.
    - >-
      Inconsistent distributor availability and long, uncertain lead times;
      buyers lack a reliable way to set service levels and safety stock per
      vendor/sku.
    - >-
      Seasonality, promotions, organized play, and release calendars aren’t
      reflected in reorder points, causing misalignment of stock to demand.
    - >-
      Multi-store complexity: poor inventory balancing and no regional demand
      visibility for transfers vs reorders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect POS/ecommerce and distributor data; cleanse SKU/vendor master and
      map variants/case packs.
    - >-
      Forecast demand per SKU per store using time series + event/release
      calendars, preorders, seasonality, and price/promotions.
    - >-
      Recommend dynamic safety stock by service level target (e.g., 95–98%) and
      lead-time variability per vendor.
    - >-
      Optimize order quantities with constraints (case packs, MOQs, open-to-buy
      budgets) and split across vendors by availability/cost.
    - >-
      Auto-generate vendor-ready POs (EDI/email/portal) with approvals; sync
      back to POS/ERP; track ETA and backorders.
    - >-
      Multi-store logic: suggest inter-store transfers vs purchase when
      faster/cheaper; regionalize forecasts.
    - >-
      Dashboards: forecast accuracy, stockout risk, inventory turns, GMROI, dead
      stock, cash tied up, and ROI impact.
    - >-
      Release radar: ingest upcoming set drops and vendor announcements;
      simulate scenarios and pre-build buys.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts by 30–50%, cut excess inventory 10–20%, and save 5–10
    hours/week by auto-generating vendor-ready POs per store/vendor that respect
    case packs, MOQs, budgets, and lead times—purpose-built for hobby, toy, and
    game retail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built models for hobby/toy/game retail that fuse cross-retailer
    sell-through, release calendars, preorders, and vendor allocation/lead-time
    behavior—plus deep distributor integrations that auto-generate compliant,
    budget-aware POs. Network effects improve forecasts regionally as more
    stores join.
