  problem:
    - >-
      Manual first-break picking is slow (4–8 hours per line-km) and
      inconsistent across analysts, delaying deliverables and inflating costs.
    - >-
      High-noise near-surface data (cultural noise, wind, coupling issues)
      causes missed/incorrect picks that propagate to poor tomography models.
    - >-
      Current tools lack uncertainty quantification and standardized QC, leading
      to subjective interpretation and rework.
    - >-
      A shortage of trained near-surface geophysicists creates processing
      bottlenecks, especially during seasonal field peaks.
    - >-
      Integrations with common acquisition formats and processing suites are
      fragmented, increasing handoffs and error risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated first-break picking with uncertainty bounds (per-trace σt) and
      noise-adaptive preconditioning; target MAE ≤1.5 ms, 95% of picks within ±3
      ms of expert consensus.
    - >-
      2D travel-time tomography (Vp and Vs via P- and S-wave refraction) with
      Tikhonov regularization and L-curve selection; target RMS misfit ≤2 ms and
      model roughness constraints.
    - >-
      Comprehensive QC dashboard: pick gather overlays, misfit histograms, ray
      coverage, sensitivity, and depth of investigation maps; red/amber/green
      flags and auto-suggested fixes.
    - >-
      Seamless data I/O: SEG-2, SEG-Y, SU, Geode, ABEM/Guideline Geo; exports to
      SEG-Y/ASCII/GeoTIFF and shapefiles; roll-along aware stitching.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop corrections: rapid batch review, assisted re-pick on
      flagged traces, audit trail, and project reproducibility.
    - >-
      API and web app for batch projects; CLI for headless integration into
      existing pipelines; job queues with SLA-based prioritization.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accelerate seismic refraction projects by 5–10x with AI-grade first-break
    picking and 2D travel-time tomography that deliver Vs/Vp sections with
    quantified uncertainty, seamless format support, and human-in-the-loop
    QC—reducing processing time from days to hours while improving model
    reliability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, heterogenous refraction dataset with calibrated
    uncertainty models and integrated HIL tomography workflow, plus deep
    integrations with incumbent tools and hardware vendors—creating switching
    costs and performance that generic pickers or manual tools cannot match.

    We understand tight field-to-report windows and noisy shots. Our
    geophysicists and ML engineers built an AI that auto-picks first breaks and
    runs 2D travel-time tomography—validated against expert picks, compatible
    with SEG2/SEGY/CSV, with human-in-the-loop QC and auditable outputs.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload your refraction data. 2) Review AI first-break picks with QC
    panels; adjust if needed. 3) Run 2D travel-time tomography and export Vs/Vp
    sections, picks, and report-ready deliverables (images, SEG-Y, GIS).
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a free pilot with your latest line. Secondary: Book a
    15-minute demo and get a sample Vs/Vp report.
  success: >-
    Consistent, defensible picks and velocity sections delivered quickly;
    predictable budgets; happier clients; stronger bids; less rework and field
    revisits.
  failure: >-
    Nights lost to hand-picking, missed deadlines, budget overruns, disputed
    deliverables, and subsurface uncertainty that erodes client trust.
