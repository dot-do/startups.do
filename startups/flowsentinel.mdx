  title: Secondary Leak Imbalance Early-Warning (Advisory)
  description: >-
    Statistical volume/pressure imbalance monitor that provides advisory
    early-warning signals to complement existing CPM/RTTM systems (not a
    regulatory replacement).

    - Build segment mass-balance with temperature/linepack compensation
    - >-
      Detect persistent imbalance using change-point and sequential probability
      tests
    - 'Filter out transients (batch cuts, pump starts) using state classifier'

    - Monthly subscription per monitored segment
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 8
    modelCapability: 7
    overall: 7
  risks:
    - Must not be marketed or used as primary CPM
    - Meter bias and temperature errors can dominate
    - Controller alert fatigue if thresholds loose
  dependencies:
    - Segment definitions and PI tags
    - Operating procedures to gate escalation
    - Legal/compliance sign-off on advisory nature
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Small and medium leaks (<0.5–1.0% of flow) can evade CPM/RTTM detection
      under transient conditions, causing delayed response and higher spill
      volumes.
    - >-
      High false-alarm rates from existing systems during batching,
      start-ups/shutdowns, and pressure transients cause alarm fatigue and
      operator desensitization.
    - >-
      Meter drift, line pack variation, and imperfect inventory accounting
      degrade mass-balance accuracy and delay leak confirmation.
    - >-
      Control centers lack a secondary, independent analytical layer that
      cross-validates CPM/RTTM outputs in real time with probabilistic
      confidence scoring.
    - >-
      Regulated operators want measurable risk reduction without introducing
      operational or compliance complexity or replacing their approved CPM/RTTM.
    - >-
      Pipeline theft taps and chronic pinhole leaks often present as subtle
      imbalances and pressure signatures that are hard to isolate quickly with
      deterministic models alone.
    - >-
      Existing solutions are costly and time-consuming to tune per line;
      operators need a lightweight, vendor-agnostic overlay that is fast to
      deploy and easy to maintain.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a vendor-agnostic analytics overlay that ingests SCADA historian
      and real-time tags (flow, pressure, temperature, valve states) to run
      statistical mass-balance and pressure-based anomaly detection.
    - >-
      Use ensemble models (change-point detection, Bayesian filters, robust
      regression, and context-aware thresholds) tuned to each pipeline’s
      operating regimes (steady-state, transients, batching).
    - >-
      Provide advisory alerts with confidence scoring, estimated leak location
      corridors, and rationale (which signals deviated, by how much, for how
      long) to aid operator decision-making.
    - >-
      Continuously self-calibrate against operating conditions (temperature
      profiles, line pack, elevation) to reduce drift and adapt thresholds
      without manual retuning.
    - >-
      Integrate via read-only connectors to CPM/RTTM and alarm management tools;
      no changes to control logic or regulatory systems required.
    - >-
      Offer historical backtesting to quantify lift over baseline systems, and a
      playbook to operationalize early-warning signals in the control room.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Independent, AI-driven advisory layer that detects subtle volume/pressure
    imbalances faster and with fewer false alarms—without replacing CPM/RTTM.
    FlowSentinel provides early-warning signals with confidence scores,
    explainability, and seamless integration, delivering measurable reductions
    in time-to-detect and product loss.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, cross-operator dataset of labeled transient and leak-like events
    enabling transfer learning for fast, high-accuracy deployment;
    transient-aware ensembles with explainable alerts tailored to control room
    workflows; vendor-agnostic, read-only integration minimizing cyber and
    operational risk; and a pilot-first methodology with quantified lift over
    baseline CPM/RTTM.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline control-room leaders and leak detection engineers who want earlier,
    trustworthy imbalance signals without disrupting CPM/RTTM or regulatory
    procedures.
  problem: >-
    - External: Small/secondary leaks and transient-induced imbalances are hard
    to see early; CPM/RTTM thresholds can delay awareness; batching/slack-line
    mask signals; alarm fatigue from noise.

    - Internal: Fear of missing a leak; low confidence during transients;
    pressure to mature the LD program without adding complexity.

    - Philosophical: Operators shouldn’t have to choose between early detection
    and operational stability/compliance.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve sat in control rooms and tuned CPM/RTTM—know the tradeoffs
    and alarm fatigue.

    - Authority: Built by pipeline LD engineers and data scientists; validated
    on historical backtests; secure, read-only integration; aligns with API
    1130/1175 and complements—not replaces—regulatory systems.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect read-only to historian/SCADA. 2) Baseline and
    calibrate statistical volume/pressure imbalance models. 3) Pilot on a
    segment; tune thresholds and workflows. 4) Go live with advisory scoring and
    explainability; review KPIs monthly. 5) Expand across assets.

    - Agreement: No changes to control-room alarm procedures; your data stays
    yours; advisory-only overlay; simple subscription; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute discovery call; start a 60-day pilot on one line.

    - Transitional: Request a backtest report using your data; download the
    technical brief and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Earlier awareness of secondary/small leaks; reduced spill volume and
    time-to-detection; fewer false negatives; higher controller confidence;
    improved LD program maturity and auditability; faster troubleshooting;
    stronger stakeholder trust.
  failure: >-
    Small leaks grow into incidents; higher cleanup costs and penalties;
    reputational damage; extended downtime; ongoing alarm fatigue and
    uncertainty; missed opportunity to raise LD program performance.

      AI advisory layer that flags statistical volume/pressure imbalances.
      Complements CPM/RTTM; not a regulatory replacement.
    ctaText: Request a demo
    ctaHref: '#demo'
  problem:
    - Small or slow leaks hide in noise and fall below steady‑state thresholds.
    - >-
      Transients (startups, shutdowns, pigging, batching) create CPM/RTTM blind
      spots.
    - Nuisance alarms erode confidence and slow real response.
    - 'Data quality issues (bad meters, dropouts) mask real imbalances.'
    - Minutes lost correlating pressure/flow/volume across long lines.
    - Regulatory systems can’t be tuned aggressively for advisory insight.
    - Manual reconciliation is time‑consuming and error‑prone.
  solution:
    - Independent AI “second opinion” focused on early advisory alerts.
    - Learns each line’s normal behavior; flags subtle deviations fast.
    - Probabilistic scores with context to prioritize credible events.
    - Transient‑aware models preserve sensitivity during non‑steady states.
    - Complements CPM/RTTM; shortens time‑to‑awareness without workflow change.
    - Seamless integration to SCADA/historians; alerts in existing tools.
    - >-
      Deploy on‑prem or secure cloud. Advisory only; not a regulatory
      replacement.

    - 'Role‑based access, audit trails, ICS network isolation.'
    - On‑prem with zero outbound or managed cloud with private link.
    - 'Fast start: model warms up from 30–90 days of history.'
    - 'KPI dashboard: time‑to‑awareness, alarm quality, sensitivity.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect data: read‑only tags and line configuration.'
    - 'Baseline: auto‑learn normal from recent history.'
