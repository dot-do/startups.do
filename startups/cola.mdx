leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High TTB rejection/resubmission rates due to small errors (type size,
      contrast, class/type wording, mandatory statements).
    - >-
      Label compliance prep is slow and manual (2–5 hours per label between
      design review, copy edits, packet assembly).
    - >-
      Regulatory changes (27 CFR Part 5 modernization; evolving guidance on age
      statements, flavorings, “handcrafted” claims, gluten-free, organic) are
      hard to track for lean teams.
    - >-
      Consultant/legal reviews are expensive ($150–$300/hr) and capacity
      constrained, delaying launches.
    - >-
      Submission packets (COLAs Online) require repetitive data entry and
      version control; teams lack audit trails and collaboration across
      design/compliance.
    - >-
      Missed state-level nuances and formula triggers lead to downstream rework
      and launch delays.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer-vision + OCR to analyze final label art (front/back) for
      mandatory elements, placement, contrast, and minimum type sizes per 27 CFR
      Part 5.
    - >-
      Rule engine mapped to TTB spirits requirements and advisories to validate
      claims (age, “straight,” “small batch,” flavoring/coloring, gluten-free,
      organic, geographic indicators, country of origin, ABV, net contents,
      name/address).
    - >-
      LLM-powered copy assistant suggesting compliant alternatives and rationale
      with source citations to CFR sections/advisories.
    - >-
      Auto-assembly of COLA submission packet: structured metadata, PDF outputs,
      image specs, versioning, and checklist completion.
    - >-
      Formula trigger detection with handoff guidance to Formulas Online when
      applicable; links to ingredient statements and supporting docs.
    - >-
      Collaboration workflow: reviewer assignments, redlines, approvals, and an
      auditable trail for internal/external stakeholders.
    - >-
      Optional human-in-the-loop review by certified compliance specialists for
      high-risk labels.
    - >-
      API/plug-ins (e.g., Adobe Illustrator) to pre-check during design,
      reducing late-stage changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut TTB label prep from hours to minutes and increase first-pass approvals.
    COLA Copilot automatically flags issues in your label art/copy, suggests
    compliant language, and assembles a complete submission packet—so you launch
    faster with fewer reworks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset of labels and TTB outcomes tied to granular rule
    annotations, plus upstream design-tool integrations and an ex-TTB reviewer
    bench that accelerates learning and drives demonstrably higher first-pass
    approvals.
