  problem:
    - >-
      Auto parts listings underperform because titles, bullets, and descriptions
      aren’t tailored to each marketplace’s SEO rules and buyer intent, leading
      to low impressions and CTR.
    - >-
      Fitment/compatibility coverage is incomplete or incorrect (ACES/PIES
      mismatch, K-Type gaps), causing returns, negative reviews, and suppressed
      listings.
    - >-
      Manual listing creation and localization is slow (10–20 minutes per SKU)
      and error-prone at scale (10k–500k SKUs).
    - >-
      Marketplaces frequently change content policies (title length, prohibited
      terms, hazmat and warranty language), creating compliance risk and listing
      takedowns.
    - >-
      Sellers lack closed-loop performance feedback to learn which keywords and
      content variants improve rank, Buy Box retention, and conversion.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven content generation: marketplace-specific titles, bullets,
      descriptions, search terms, and backend keywords optimized for top queries
      and buyer intent.
    - >-
      Fitment localization: map ACES/PIES to marketplace-specific taxonomies
      (Amazon Part Finder, eBay K-Type, Walmart attributes) and local
      language/terminology (e.g., hood vs. bonnet).
    - >-
      Compliance engine: enforce Amazon/eBay/Walmart style guides, length
      limits, attribute completeness, hazmat/warranty language, prohibited
      claims, and catalog browse node rules.
    - >-
      Bulk operations: ingest PIM/ERP feeds (PIES, CSV, API) and generate at
      scale with delta updates and versioning.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optimization: track keyword rank, CTR, conversion, defect
      rate, and returns; automatically propose content and fitment revisions.
    - >-
      A/B and cohort testing: controlled rollouts by SKU group or vehicle
      segment; measure lift in session share and conversion.
    - >-
      Quality assurance: confidence scores, human-in-the-loop review, and
      exception queues for ambiguous fitments or policy-risk content.
    - >-
      Localization: translate and adapt content for EN/DE/FR/ES/IT with
      auto-metric/imperial conversions and local regulatory phrasing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase organic visibility and conversion for automotive listings by
    auto-generating marketplace-compliant, localized titles/bullets/descriptions
