  title: Sketch-to-3D Proxy Modeling
  description: >-
    Turn rough sketches into scale-checked proxy 3D forms to evaluate
    proportions and packaging early.
  targetUsers:
    - Industrial designers
    - Design engineers
  triggers:
    - Have 2D sketches but need rough 3D
    - Need early packaging/volume check
  inputs:
    - Hand/digital sketches (front/side/iso)
    - Key envelope dimensions and constraints
    - Target manufacturing method (optional)
  steps:
    - Detect edges and views; estimate camera/projection
    - Block out subD proxy; align to envelope constraints
    - 'Refine key highlights/radii, boolean major cutouts'
    - Scale-check against provided dimensions
    - Export mesh proxy and basic solids
  tools:
    - Blender (Python)
    - trimesh
    - Open3D
    - CadQuery (for simple solids)
  outputs:
    - Watertight proxy mesh (OBJ/FBX)
    - Basic STEP/IGES solids for engineering handoff
    - Scale-check report (PDF)
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per product: $350–$800 (complexity-based)'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 4.8
    modelCapability: 3.9
    overall: 4.1
  risks:
    - Geometry accuracy limits vs final CAD
    - Hard-to-edit topology for surfacing
    - Misinterpretation of sketch intent
  dependencies:
    - Sketch files with at least 2 views
    - Dimension references

  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage industrial design teams lose 5–10 hours per week per designer
      creating rough 3D proxy models from hand sketches for proportion and
      packaging checks.
    - >-
      Manual proxy modeling in Rhino/SolidWorks/Blender delays concept
      iteration; a single proxy often takes 1–3 hours and is frequently
      discarded after discussions.
    - >-
      Misalignment between sketch intent and engineering constraints causes
      late-stage rework; dimensional inaccuracies are discovered only after
      mechanical packaging is attempted.
    - >-
      Current 2D-to-3D AI tools generate mesh assets unsuitable for CAD
      workflows (lack scale, poor topology, no NURBS/T-Splines), forcing rework.
    - >-
      Design managers lack a fast, standardized way to compare proportions
      across multiple concepts and communicate with mechanical teams early.
    - >-
      Security and IP concerns prevent teams from testing generic cloud AI
      image-to-3D tools; they need enterprise-grade privacy and on-prem options.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered conversion of single or multi-view sketches into dimensionally
      aware 3D proxy models (mesh or NURBS/T-Spline surfaces) with
      user-specified scale anchors and symmetry.
    - >-
      Proportion controls (length/width/height sliders, radii, chamfer, fillet
      heuristics) and constraint-aware adjustments to quickly explore
      alternatives.
    - >-
      Packaging envelope/cavity generator to create internal volume blocks for
      PCB, battery, motor, or mechanism placeholders and quick fit checks.
    - >-
      One-click export to STEP/IGES for CAD and OBJ/FBX/GLB for visualization;
      Rhino, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Blender, and KeyShot plugins.
    - >-
      Enterprise privacy with local/on-prem inference option, SSO/SAML,
      project-level isolation, and audit logs.
    - >-
      Interactive web viewer for reviews: annotate, measure, overlay against
      reference dims, and compare versions side-by-side.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn rough sketches into scale-checked, CAD-friendly proxy 3D forms in
    minutes, so teams can evaluate proportions and packaging on day one—cutting
    proxy modeling time by 80–90% while keeping IP secure.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, consented corpus of paired sketch-to-CAD datasets with
    dimensional ground truth and packaging metadata, plus CAD-native output
    (STEP/IGES) and enterprise-grade deployment options that generalist 2D-to-3D
    AI tools lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Industrial design consultancies (10–200 staff) serving consumer
      electronics, appliances, furniture, mobility, toys, and medical devices.

  character: >-
    Industrial designers and hardware teams who need to validate proportion and
    packaging early—without burning days on CAD.
  problem: >-
    External: Early concepts stall because turning sketches into 3D volumes is
    slow and error‑prone. Internal: You’re under pressure to make the right call
    on size, stance, and component fit with incomplete data. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t have to gamble timelines and budget just to see if a form works.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve sat in sprint reviews where “just a quick volume check” eats
    a week. Authority: Built by ID veterans and ML engineers; scale‑aware
    generation, component bounding, and dimension checks; secure, NDA‑ready
    workflow; proxy forms for volumetric evaluation (not final surfacing).
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload sketch + target dims/components. 2) Receive scale‑checked
    proxy 3D in hours. 3) Review, tweak constraints, and export (STEP/OBJ) for
    CAD refinement. Agreement: fixed pricing, private models, no training on
    your data without consent.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Upload a sketch to start. Transitional: Book a 15‑minute demo and
    get a sample proxy from your sketch.
  success: >-
    Confident proportion decisions, packaging clarity, fewer CAD reworks, faster
    stakeholder buy‑in, broader concept exploration, and a shorter path to
    EVT/DVT.
  failure: >-
    Avoid weeks lost to scratch CAD, late‑stage size changes, misfit components,
    costly prototypes, missed milestones, and avoidable design churn.

    title: Sketch‑to‑3D Proxy Modeling
    subtitle: >-
      Turn rough sketches into scale‑checked 3D forms. Validate proportions,
      packaging, and ergonomics in minutes—not weeks.
    ctaText: Try it free
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - Early proportion and packaging decisions rely on 2D guesswork.
    - Rough CAD blocking steals hours from design time.
    - Scale errors slip in from perspective and sketch distortion.
    - Feedback loops stall waiting for model updates.
    - 'Component fit is discovered late, causing rework.'
    - Teams struggle to communicate volume and stance.
  solution:
    - AI converts sketches to watertight proxy 3D in minutes.
    - 'Dimension‑aware: set key sizes to lock scale.'
    - Auto perspective correction for true‑to‑size projection.
    - Drop in standard components to check fit early.
    - Generate variants and compare side‑by‑side.
    - 'Export STEP/OBJ/FBX for CAD, render, and 3D print.'
    - Share web viewer links for instant feedback.
  features:
    - 'Sketch import from photo, scan, or PDF with guide overlays.'
    - Key dimension tagging and automatic scale solving.
    - Human‑factors mannequins and reach envelopes.
    - 'Library of batteries, motors, PCBs, lenses, and fasteners.'
    - 'Adjustable proxies: stance, wall thickness, radii, and split lines.'
    - Snap‑to envelopes and packaging volume builder.
    - 'Version history, annotations, and measure tools.'
    - 'Direct send to SolidWorks, Fusion, and Rhino via plugins.'
    - Metric/imperial units and tolerance presets.
    - Batch processing for concept boards and explorations.
  steps:
    - Upload a sketch or snap a photo.
    - Tag one or two reference dimensions and choose units.
    - Set an envelope or drop in components to fit.
    - Generate the proxy 3D and refine with sliders.
    - Check scale with mannequins and key measurements.
    - Export to CAD/render/print or share a viewer link.
