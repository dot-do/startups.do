leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      6–10% of residents pay rent after the due date each month, creating
      cash-flow volatility and owner dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Leasing/AR staff spend 5–10 minutes per delinquent account per cycle on
      manual outreach; for 1,000 units at 8% late rate that’s 6.7–13.3 staff
      hours/month.
    - >-
      Generic PMS reminders underperform (typical email CTR 5–10%); no
      personalization by resident history or language, yielding low conversion
      to payment.
    - >-
      Compliance risk from non‑compliant SMS/email (TCPA/10DLC/FDCPA-state
      analogs) exposes firms to carrier blocking and fines of $500–$1,500 per
      violation.
    - >-
      Friction to pay: residents must locate portal, remember passwords, and
      navigate to ledgers; every extra click increases abandonment 10–20%.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: PMs lack A/B testing, cohort analytics, or unit-level
      ROI to optimize cadence and tone across portfolios.
  solution:
    - >-
      Resident data sync: securely ingest residents, ledgers, lease terms, grace
      periods, comms preferences from PMS via API/SFTP; refresh daily.
    - >-
      Smart cadence: pre‑due, due‑date, grace‑period, and post‑due sequences via
      SMS/email with quiet hours, time‑zone awareness, and 10DLC compliance.
    - >-
      Personalized messaging: AI tailors tone, timing, language (EN/ES), and
      subject lines to resident behavior (e.g., typical pay day, prior
      responses, sensitivity to late fees).
    - >-
      1‑click payment links: tokenized, expiring deep links that land the
      resident at the correct PMS payment page with account context; optional
      guest‑checkout where supported.
    - >-
      Autopay nudges: identify candidates and drive autopay enrollment to
      compound improvements over time.
    - >-
      Optimization: built‑in A/B testing, cohort analytics, and goal tracking
      (click→pay within 48 hours).
    - >-
      Compliance engine: opt‑in/opt‑out handling, STOP/HELP keywords,
      state-by-state rules, 8am–9pm local delivery windows, message logging, and
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Dashboards & alerts: portfolio, property, and unit‑level KPIs; SLA alerts
      for high-risk accounts; exportable reports and webhooks.
    - >-
      Fast start: 2‑week pilot via CSV exports + BCC email catch with payment
      link mapping; upgrade to native API integration post‑pilot.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase on-time rent by 15–30% and cut AR follow-up time by 50% with
    compliant, personalized nudges and 1‑click payment links that work with your
    existing PMS and resident portal.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking message tone/timing to rent payment
    outcomes across PMS platforms, combined with a compliance-by-design engine
    (10DLC, TCPA, state rules) and deep-link payment tokenization that most
    PMS-native reminders lack. Early evidence from controlled pilots (RCTs)
    hardens playbooks others can’t easily replicate.
