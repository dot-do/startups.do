  problem:
    - >-
      Manual post-deposit booking work (emailing suppliers, logging into
      portals, capturing confirmations, updating systems) consumes 30–60% of an
      ops team’s time and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Missed supplier deadlines (release dates, payment cut-offs) lead to
      cancellations, penalties, and rework.
    - >-
      Fragmented supplier landscape (email-only DMCs, B2B hotel wholesalers,
      activity portals) forces staff to learn many different flows and formats.
    - >-
      Confirmation emails and PDFs are inconsistent; extracting key data (PNRs,
      locators, room types, pick-up times, rate conditions) is tedious and often
      misfiled.
    - >-
      Voucher and rooming-list creation is slow, non-standardized, and often
      contains mistakes that cause on-the-ground friction.
    - >-
      Ops leaders lack visibility into real-time booking status, exceptions, and
      SLA compliance across all itineraries/suppliers.
    - >-
      Scaling seasonal peaks requires hiring/training temporary staff or
      outsourcing to BPOs with long ramp times and QA overhead.
  solution:
    - >-
      Autonomous booking execution: reads the confirmed itinerary after deposit,
      contacts suppliers via email or logs into B2B portals to place/confirm
      bookings per SOPs.
    - >-
      Smart confirmation capture: parses supplier emails/PDFs to extract
      locators, rate plans, inclusions, deadlines, and policies; syncs to the
      operator’s system.
    - >-
      Voucher and rooming-list generation: produces branded, standardized
      documents per supplier/client requirements and delivers on schedule.
    - >-
      Exception handling and supplier liaison: manages changes, special
      requests, cancellations, and deadline reminders; escalates edge cases to
      human ops within SLAs.
    - >-
      Deadline and policy watchdog: tracks release dates, payment cut-offs, and
      change windows; triggers actions or alerts to avoid penalties.
    - >-
      Integrations-first: plugs into tour operator CRMs/ERPs (e.g., WeTravel,
      Travefy, Tourplan, Lemax) plus email (O365/Gmail), storage, and messaging
      (Slack/MS Teams).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: configurable review gates for high-value bookings or
      new suppliers; continuous learning from corrections.
    - >-
      Audit, compliance, and observability: full action logs, versioned
      documents, SOC2/GDPR program, credential vault, role-based access.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI-powered, human-overseen booking operations agent that executes
    supplier bookings via email/portals, captures confirmations with >98%
    parsing accuracy, and generates standardized vouchers/rooming lists within
    minutes—cutting post-deposit ops time by 50–70% and reducing avoidable
    penalties to near-zero.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary library of supplier-specific booking and confirmation
    patterns (emails, PDFs, and portal flows) plus travel-tuned parsers and SOP
    templates, reinforced by human-in-the-loop feedback at scale—yielding higher
    accuracy and broader supplier coverage than generic RPA/LLM tools or
    traditional BPOs.
