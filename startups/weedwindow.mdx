  problem:
    - >-
      Escapes from herbicide‑resistant weeds (e.g., Palmer amaranth, waterhemp,
      marestail) cause 5–30% yield loss if control is delayed beyond 10–14 days
      after emergence.
    - >-
      Narrow, weather‑dependent spray windows (wind, inversions, temperature,
      precipitation) and label/regulatory cutoffs are hard to align; missed
      windows drive expensive resprays ($10–$30/ac) and yield loss.
    - >-
      Manual scouting lacks spatial precision and is labor‑intensive (2–4
      hours/1,000 acres/week) with inconsistent identification across scouts.
    - >-
      High drift/liability risk and complex record‑keeping for audits;
      applicators need defensible logs proving label-aware decisions.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (weather app, label PDFs, maps, prescriptions) create
      workflow friction and slow response time to outbreaks.
    - >-
      Existing imagery tools show crop vigor but do not reliably identify
      cotton-specific weeds under canopy or translate detection into executable
      spray timing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Capture: Guided phone (walking/ATV) or drone flights with QC prompts;
      10–20 minutes per 160 acres.
    - >-
      Detect: Cotton‑trained weed model classifies species and density at
      plot/row‑zone level across growth stages (pre‑ to mid‑canopy).
    - >-
      Map: Auto‑generated weed heatmaps and economic threshold overlays to
      prioritize fields/blocks.
    - >-
      Advise: Spray Window Engine fuses 0–96h mesoscale forecasts
      (wind/inversion risk/precip/temp/humidity) with product label + local
      rules to recommend specific start/stop times by field/zone.
    - >-
      Act: One‑click export of variable‑rate/spot‑spray shapefiles (ISO‑XML/John
      Deere/Case IH/AgLeader) and job sheets for custom applicators.
    - >-
      Alert: Push/SMS alerts when a 24–72h compliant window opens, with
      confidence score and backup windows.
    - >-
      Comply: Automated, time‑stamped records (conditions, label checks,
      prescription used) for audits and drift defense.
    - >-
      ROI: Economic calculators estimate cost/acre, expected control, and
      respray risk reduction.
    - >-
      Integrate: Sync fields/equipment with Ops Center, Climate FieldView, and
      retailer work order systems.
    - >-
      Learn: Continuous improvement loop with optional ground‑truth photos and
      post‑spray efficacy checks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
