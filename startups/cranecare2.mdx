  problem:
    - >-
      High downtime cost: unplanned crane/hoist outages commonly cost
      US$5,000–$30,000 per hour in metals, automotive, paper, and ports; MTTR is
      often 6–24 hours due to slow triage and parts uncertainty.
    - >-
      Low first-time-fix rates (FTFR 55–70%) caused by fragmented OEM manuals,
      cryptic VFD/PLC fault codes, and tribal knowledge concentrated in a few
      senior techs.
    - >-
      Safety risk and compliance burden: inconsistent lockout/tagout steps and
      failure to follow ASME B30/CMAA/OSHA guidance during troubleshooting;
      near-miss incidents go unlearned.
    - >-
      Inefficient service operations: Level-1/dispatcher struggles to triage;
      too many escalations to Level-2; avoidable truck rolls; lack of standard
      diagnostic workflows across brands.
    - >-
      Parts identification errors (wrong SKU, missing cross-reference) lead to
      second visits and expedited freight; parts picking accuracy frequently
      <75% for multi-brand fleets.
    - >-
      Data silos: service tickets, drive logs, PLC diagnostics, and inspection
      reports live in disconnected systems (email, PDFs, CMMS, OEM portals).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI triage assistant that ingests service tickets, photos of drive/HMI
      fault screens, and PLC/VFD logs, returning the likely root cause, guided
      diagnostic steps, safety notes, and parts list with cross-refs.
    - >-
      Safety-first workflows: dynamic lockout/tagout reminders and ASME
      B30/CMAA/OSHA notes embedded at each step; blocks high-risk actions
      without proper prechecks.
    - >-
      Parts intelligence: maps OEM/aftermarket SKUs, availability, and
      substitutes; outputs a pick list linked to distributor inventory; flags
      warranty eligibility.
    - >-
      Seamless integrations: connectors for CMMS/EAM/Field Service tools and
      Teams/Slack; generates ticket updates, work instructions, and time-stamped
      audit trails.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: feedback loop from technician outcomes to improve
      suggestions; organization-specific knowledge capture to reduce reliance on
      tribal expertise.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cross-OEM AI copilot that turns fault codes, drive logs, and service tickets
    into safe, step-by-step diagnostics and accurate parts suggestions—reducing
    MTTR by up to 30%, improving first-time-fix by 15–25 points, and cutting
    escalations and truck rolls by 30–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset linking specific drive/PLC fault codes and
    symptoms to proven fixes and parts used across multiple OEMs—validated by
    real outcomes—and safety-validated, cross-brand diagnostic workflows
    embedded into customers’ ticketing systems. Early partnerships with
    drive/PLC vendors and distributors create defensible data moats and
    preferred routing for parts.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Maintenance leaders, OEM support reps, and field technicians for overhead
    traveling cranes, hoists, and monorails who want faster, safer diagnostics,
    fewer callbacks, and minimal downtime.
  problem: >-
    External: Cryptic PLC/VFD fault codes, scattered manuals, and noisy tickets
    slow triage and risk unsafe steps. Internal: Pressure to restore production,
    meet SLAs, and prove compliance with limited expert availability.
    Philosophical: Industrial data should make cranes safer and uptime
    predictable—not be trapped in PDFs and siloed logs.
  guide: >-
    We understand the stress of a down bridge crane. Crane/Hoist Troubleshooting
    Copilot pairs domain-trained AI with controller log parsers and parts
    catalogs, delivering safety-first guidance aligned with OSHA 1910.179 and
    ASME B30 practices, so teams feel supported by a knowledgeable partner—not a
    generic chatbot.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect ticketing and upload/stream controller logs and fault
    snapshots; 2) Copilot triages, maps codes to causes, and surfaces safety
    checks; 3) It returns step-by-step diagnostics and likely parts; 4) Tech
    confirms actions and syncs results to the ticket. Agreement:
    human-in-the-loop decisions, auditable recommendations, data privacy by
    design, vendor-agnostic integrations.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-day pilot on your top crane families. Transitional:
    Try the sandbox with sample logs and get a safety + diagnostics checklist.
  success: >-
    Reduced MTTR, higher first-time-fix rate, fewer truck rolls, consistent LOTO
    and safety notes, standardized troubleshooting across brands, faster parts
    ordering, met SLAs, and happier customers with stronger service margins.
  failure: >-
    Prolonged downtime, ad-hoc and risky troubleshooting, repeated callbacks,
    missed SLAs, costly expedited parts, technician burnout, and eroding OEM
    reputation.
