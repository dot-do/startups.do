  problem:
    - >-
      Fabric is 40–70% of COGS in many textile mills; manual or rule-based
      nesting often leaves 3–10% avoidable waste.
    - >-
      Marker making can take 30–120 minutes per style/size set, bottlenecking
      short runs and changeovers.
    - >-
      Yield estimates for quotes are frequently off by ±5–10%, causing margin
      erosion or lost bids.
    - >-
      Existing tools are OEM-locked, seat-based, and hard to integrate with
      ERP/MES; smaller mills underutilize them due to cost and complexity.
    - >-
      Constraints unique to technical textiles (grainline, symmetry, paired
      parts, variable allowances, defect/shade zones, roll width changes) are
      not consistently handled in legacy workflows.
    - >-
      Skilled marker makers are scarce and tribal knowledge is not captured;
      results vary by operator, shift, or plant.
    - >-
      Shorter runs, customization, and mixed-material products increase setup
      overhead that current systems don’t optimize well.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered marker making that ingests AAMA/ASTM DXF, layered PDFs,
      HPGL/PLT, and normalizes patterns with notches, seam allowances,
      grainlines, and metadata.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware auto-nesting (grain/symmetry/pairs/flip rules/gap
      allowances/rotation limits) with multi-lay and multi-size ratios.
    - >-
      Cut plan optimization across roll widths/lengths, ply counts, and
      shade/lot groupings; optional integration of defect maps from fabric
      inspection systems to avoid flaws.
    - >-
      Real-time yield/cost estimator with scenario simulation for alternate
      widths, fabrics, and spread strategies; side-by-side comparisons vs
      baseline markers.
    - >-
      Batch processing queue to generate dozens/hundreds of markers unattended;
      SLA-backed cloud or on-prem/edge deployment for offline plants.
    - >-
      Exports to DXF/AAMA, PDF markers, HPGL/PLT for Gerber, Lectra, Tukatech,
      Zünd, Eastman, Bullmer, Autometrix; API for ERP/MES/PLM.
    - >-
      Savings audit: automated reports comparing fabric utilization, marker
      length, and cycle time vs prior methods; operator learning loop to
      continuously improve.
    - >-
      Role-based access, SSO, encryption at rest/in transit, detailed audit
      trails, and versioned marker libraries.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce fabric waste by 2–6% and cut plan time by 50–80% using AI-driven
    nesting on your existing DXF/PDF patterns, with verifiable savings reports,
    ERP/CAM integrations, and a 30-day ROI pilot.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, dataset-driven engine that learns from real production across
    many technical textile categories, yielding consistent savings that legacy
    rule-based systems miss; reproducible AI with audit trails that pass
    enterprise scrutiny; flexible deployment (cloud or edge) and a
    pay-on-savings option that de-risks adoption.

  character: >-
    Production planners, marker makers, and cutting-room managers at All Other
    Miscellaneous Textile Product Mills who must hit margins, quote yields
    accurately, and minimize fabric waste.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual or suboptimal nesting wastes fabric and time; inconsistent
    markers and DXF/PDF prep slow cut rooms. Internal: Uncertainty about yields
    and buys creates stress and margin risk. Philosophical: Good materials
    shouldn’t be wasted—every inch should add value.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know cutting rooms run on tight deadlines and thin margins.
    Authority: AI trained on real-world markers across fabric types; integrates
    with Gerber/Lectra/Optitex; secure, auditable DXF/PDF/CSV outputs; expert
    implementation support.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload patterns, size run, and fabric rules; 2) AI nests to
    constraints (grain, nap, stripe/plaids, shrinkage, buffer, spread length)
    and explores scenarios; 3) Review yields/costs and export optimal markers as
    DXF/PDF plus cut plans or via API. Agreement: Pilot first, clear data
    privacy, transparent per‑marker or subscription pricing.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo or start a free pilot (first 10 markers).
    Transitional: Download a sample yield report and try the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Lean fabric utilization, confident buy plans, faster quoting, reliable
    deliveries, lower waste and cost, and a calmer, more productive cutting
    room.
  failure: >-
    Overbuying fabric, missed margins, overtime in cutting, unpredictable
    quotes, avoidable waste to landfill, and lost bids.
