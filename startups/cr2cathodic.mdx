  problem:
    - >-
      Underprotection is detected late due to infrequent surveys (e.g., monthly
      rectifier checks, annual CIS) and limited telemetry coverage, allowing
      corrosion to progress between readings.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across SCADA/RTU logs, rectifier telemetry,
      CIS/DCVG/ACVG surveys, coupon/off-potential data, ILI anomalies,
      soil/resistivity maps, work orders, and GIS; manual reconciliation is
      slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Prioritizing digs/repairs is subjective; likelihood (corrosion activity)
      is weakly linked to consequence (HCA/MCA, diameter, pressure, product,
      receptors), leading to suboptimal risk-per-dollar allocation.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (PHMSA Gas Mega Rule, 49 CFR 192 Subpart O; AMPP/NACE)
      requires demonstrable, documented risk-based decisions and CP
      effectiveness; audit findings can trigger CAPEX and fines.
    - >-
      Dynamic drivers (AC/DC interference, seasonal soil moisture/salinity,
      coating condition) cause CP variability; operators lack predictive alerts
      and root-cause context.
    - >-
      Field resources are constrained; false alarms and low-priority truck rolls
      waste budget and extend backlogs for high-risk assets.
    - >-
      Cost of unnecessary digs is high ($25k–$200k per dig); missing high-risk
      defects can cause incidents costing $1M–$50M+ including downtime and
      penalties.
    - >-
      Aging coating systems and legacy assets increase corrosion likelihood;
      integrating ILI signals and CP data remains technically challenging.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data fabric that ingests and normalizes CP and integrity data
      (rectifier/coupon/test station telemetry, CIS/DCVG/ACVG, ILI anomalies,
      work orders, GIS, weather/soil), resolving timestamps and locations to
      pipeline centerline and HCA/MCAs.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML risk scoring (PoF × CoF) using CP criteria (e.g., AMPP
      21424, formerly SP0169), coating type/age, soil resistivity/moisture, AC
      interference, ILI metal loss/fatigue, pressure cycles, and leak/repair
      history.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring to detect underprotection, trend drifts, and AC/DC
      interference; predictive alerts with lead time targets (≥7–14 days) and
      root-cause hypotheses.
    - >-
      Automated, explainable prioritization of digs/repairs: ranks segments by
      marginal risk-reduction-per-dollar; generates quarterly dig lists and
      justifications.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning: simulate rectifier adjustments, coupon
      additions, grounding/bonding, or coating repairs and estimate risk and
      cost impacts before field action.
    - >-
      Work management integration: push recommended interventions and inspection
      tasks into SAP PM/IBM Maximo; two-way status sync for closure and
      learning.
    - >-
      Regulatory and audit pack: evidence trails, decision logs, criteria
      thresholds, and change management aligned to PHMSA Subpart O and operator
      IM plans.
    - >-
      Field support: mobile-ready maps, offline packages, and photo/reading
      capture to improve data quality and shorten feedback loops.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously monitor CP performance and rank corrosion risk by segment with
    explainable, standards-aligned AI—predict underprotection up to 14 days
    sooner, reduce unnecessary digs by 20–40%, and concentrate 50–70% of annual
    corrosion risk reduction in the top 10–20% of interventions, with
    audit-ready traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, physics-informed risk models trained on cross-operator,
    outcomes-labeled datasets; deep, prebuilt integrations into CP/ILI/GIS/EAM
    ecosystems; audit-ready decision governance mapped to PHMSA/AMPP; and a
    growing data network effect that improves predictions and optimization over

  character: >-
    Pipeline integrity and corrosion engineers at natural-gas operators who want
    clear, defensible priorities for CP maintenance, digs, and repairs to keep
    assets protected and compliant.
  problem: >-
    External—disconnected CP data, drifting potentials, limited crews, and audit
    pressure; Internal—uncertainty about where risk is highest and what to do
    next; Philosophical—safety, environmental stewardship, and compliance
    shouldn’t rely on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’re corrosion engineers and data scientists who understand PHMSA/CFR 192
    expectations and field realities. We bring a transparent, auditable AI risk
    engine that monitors CP assets, flags underprotection, and prioritizes
    action.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect CIS, rectifier/test-station, SCADA, ILI, and work-order data via
    API/SFTP. 2) AI flags underprotection, weights threats, and ranks segments
    for digs/repairs with multi-factor scoring. 3) Issue work packs, track
    remediation, and verify CP restoration with closed-loop reporting. No
    rip-and-replace; your data stays yours; start with one district.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct—Book a 30-minute demo and scope a 90-day pilot. Transitional—Request
    a sample risk report and validate on your historical digs.
  success: >-
    Auditable priorities, fewer emergency digs, optimized CP spend, improved
    safety and reliability, confident regulatory responses, and proactive
    mitigation that prevents leaks and downtime.
  failure: >-
    Avoid NOPVs and fines, unplanned outages, gas releases, escalating corrosion
    damage, crew overtime, and wasted budget chasing low-risk anomalies.
