  problem:
    - >-
      Creators and small studios struggle to meet varying DSP loudness/true-peak
      specs (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Tidal, Amazon) leading to
      unpredictable playback, penalized normalization, and audible distortion.
    - >-
      Manual mastering is expensive, slow (24–72 hours), and inconsistent; DIY
      tools require expertise and do not simulate codec-induced true-peak overs.
    - >-
      Distributors receive high volumes of non-compliant masters, causing QC
      rejects, re-upload delays, and increased support load.
    - >-
      Post-production/podcasting teams need fast batch conformance to EBU
      R128/ATSC A/85, but current workflows are fragmented across multiple
      tools.
    - >-
      There is no simple, auditable “proof-of-compliance” deliverable that
      labels and clients can attach to masters for downstream partners.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI mastering engine trained on reference masters across genres; adaptive
      EQ, multiband dynamics, transient shaping, stereo enhancement, and limiter
      stage optimized for true-peak safety.
    - >-
      Platform profiles with up-to-date targets (typical guidance:
      Spotify/YouTube/Tidal ≈ -14 LUFS integrated, Apple Music Sound Check ≈ -16
      LUFS, Amazon/Deezer ≈ -14 LUFS; true-peak ceiling -1.0 to -2.0 dBTP
      depending on codec risk) and auto-creation of platform-specific
      deliverables.
    - >-
      Codec simulation (AAC, Ogg/Opus, MP3) to predict inter-sample peaks;
      automatic headroom and limiter behavior to eliminate post-encode clipping.
    - >-
      Batch processing, stem-aware mode (vocals/drums/bass/other), and style
      presets (pop, hip-hop, EDM, rock, classical, podcast speech).
    - >-
      Automated QC report: ITU-R BS.1770-4 measurements, true-peak, short-term
      range, crest factor, and per-platform pass/fail with recommendations;
      exportable as PDF/JSON for clients and distributors.
    - >-
      Delivery management: versioning (e.g., Spotify master, Apple master),
      dithering, SRC, and export to WAV/FLAC/AIFF at 16/24-bit and 44.1–96 kHz;
      broadcast targets for EBU R128 (-23 LUFS) and ATSC A/85 (-24 LKFS).
    - >-
      Web app, desktop app/CLI, DAW plugin (AU/VST3/AAX), and REST API for
      distributors and studios.
    - >-
      Optional human review: certified mastering engineers provide final tweaks,
      notes, and approval within 12–24 hours.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Streaming-safe masters every time: codec-aware AI mastering that guarantees
    per-platform loudness/true-peak compliance with documented QC
    reports—delivered in minutes, with optional human engineer review when
    needed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Codec-aware true-peak prediction and per-platform behavior modeling trained
    on a large, continually updated test corpus—combined with a documented QC
    passport and a conformance warranty (we re-master free if a platform flags
    or audibly clips). Deep distributor/API integrations embed PeakProof in the
    release pipeline, creating switching costs.

    Audio creators and catalog owners in Other Sound Recording Industries (NAICS
    512290)—indie labels, mix engineers, post houses, and podcast networks—who
    need streaming-ready masters that meet platform loudness and true-peak specs
    without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    - External: Platforms normalize to different targets; re-encodes can create
    inter-sample peaks; QC rejects for exceeding LUFS/dBTP.

    - Internal: Uncertainty and time lost to endless revisions; fear of
    distorted playback and unhappy clients.

    - Philosophical: Your work deserves to be heard as intended—clean,
    consistent, and competitive—on every platform.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the pain of platform QC, inconsistent meters, and
    last‑minute distributor rejections.

    - Authority: Built by mastering engineers and ML researchers; calibrated to
    ITU BS.1770-4/EBU R128 and common platform targets; validated against pro
    reference masters; optional human mastering oversight.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Upload your mix and choose targets (e.g., Spotify -14 LUFS, Apple
    -16 LUFS, YouTube -13 LUFS) and true-peak ceiling (e.g., -1.0 dBTP).

    - Step 2: Our AI masters for tonal balance and dynamics, then conforms
    loudness/true-peak with ISP-safe limiting; request optional human review.

    - Step 3: Download platform-ready deliverables (24-bit WAV, AAC/MP3 if
    needed) plus a QC report (LUFS-I, LRA, dBTP, crest); scale via presets or
    API.

    - Assurance: Transparent pricing, non-destructive workflow, and approval
    before delivery.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Upload a mix—get a streaming-ready master in minutes.

    - Transitional: Run a free loudness preview/QC report; book a 15‑minute
    consult; request API sandbox access.
  success: >-
    - Pass aggregator QC on the first attempt—no clipping after normalization.

    - Consistent playback across Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Tidal, and
    social platforms.

    - Competitive masters without over-limiting; confident artists and clients.

    - Faster turnarounds, fewer revisions, reduced costs; scalable for catalogs
    and post workflows.
  failure: >-
    - Distorted, fatiguing playback after normalization and transcodes.

    - Rejected deliveries, missed release dates, support escalations, and lost
    placements.

    - Inconsistent catalog loudness, hurt brand perception, and wasted
    engineering time.
