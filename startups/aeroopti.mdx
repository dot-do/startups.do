  problem:
    - >-
      Fans, blowers, and air purification units frequently run at fixed or
      poorly tuned speeds, wasting 10–30% of fan energy due to suboptimal VFD
      parameters, static pressure setpoints, and staging.
    - >-
      OEMs lack post-installation performance visibility; equipment
      underperforms in the field, hurting brand perception and upsell/service
      revenue.
    - >-
      BMS/PLC logs (BACnet/Modbus/OPC UA/historians) are abundant but
      underutilized; no fan-specialized analytics converts them into actionable
      savings.
    - >-
      Facilities fear IAQ/process risk when reducing fan speed; operators need
      guardrails and validated recommendations to avoid downtime or
      non-compliance.
    - >-
      Controls contractors and SIs are time-constrained; they rarely perform
      deep analytics on archived logs, so setpoints are static and PID loops may
      oscillate.
    - >-
      VFDs are installed but not optimized (min/max speed, carrier frequency,
      accel/decel, DC braking, sleep, energy-optimized autotune), leaving 5–10%
      savings unrealized.
    - >-
      Static pressure setpoints are not dynamically reset (e.g.,
      trim-and-respond), causing continuous over-ventilation and high fan power
      (cubic affinity law).
    - >-
      Filter loading and fouling increase static pressure; fans ramp up
      unnecessarily instead of switching to DP-based strategies or cleaning
      intervals.
    - >-
      Parallel fan banks and AHU supply/return staging are poorly sequenced,
      causing hunting, backflow, or both fans running inefficiently at low duty.
    - >-
      Lack of credible measurement and verification (M&V) means missed utility
      incentives and slow internal approvals for ECMs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize BMS/PLC/historian data (BACnet, Modbus, OPC UA,
      SQL/CSV) for fans, VFDs, DP sensors, dampers, temperatures,
      occupancy/process signals.
    - >-
      Build physics-informed baseline models (fan affinity laws + system curve
      estimation) to quantify energy waste by mode, schedule, and setpoint.
    - >-
      Identify ECMs: VFD min/max speed tuning, static pressure trim-and-respond,
      zone reset, supply/return coordination, fan bank staging,
      demand-controlled ventilation, filter DP-based control, night set-back,
      and PID retuning.
    - >-
      Auto-generate OEM-grade control logic blocks and parameter sets for common
      PLCs/VFDs (e.g., ABB, Danfoss, Yaskawa, Rockwell, Siemens) with safety and
      IAQ/process guardrails.
    - >-
      Quantify savings with IPMVP-compliant M&V (Option B/C) and produce
      incentive-ready documentation, including CV(RMSE), NMBE, and uncertainty
      bounds.
    - >-
      Provide fleet benchmarking and anomaly detection (oscillation, damper
      leakage, reversed flow, belt slip) with alerting and recommended fixes.
    - >-
      Offer fast-track “Data Drop Audit” (2 weeks of logs) to estimate savings
      and ROI in under 5 business days.
    - >-
      Deliver commissioning support: remote validation, test scripts, and
      post-implementation stabilization to ensure persistence of savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut fan energy 10–25% in 90 days by turning BMS/PLC logs into automated VFD
    and duty optimization, with OEM-grade control blocks and verified M&V—no new
    sensors required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Fan-focused, physics-informed AI with OEM-vetted control blocks and
    parameter sets, underpinned by a growing proprietary dataset of real-world
    fan duty profiles and savings outcomes—enabling faster time-to-value, safer
    deployment, and credible M&V that generalist analytics platforms cannot
    match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Industrial/commercial fan, blower, and air purification OEMs (product,
    sales, and aftermarket leaders) who want to turn BMS/PLC logs into provable
    energy savings and differentiated retrofit offerings (VFDs, duty
    optimization, setpoints, control).
  problem: >-
    External: Fans run at constant speed, oversized setpoints, and poor
    scheduling—wasting energy and missing rebates; BMS/PLC data is messy and
    manual audits are slow.

    Internal: OEM teams struggle to quantify ROI quickly, slowing sales and
    making premium products look like commodities.

    Philosophical: Energy waste is unacceptable—airflow should be delivered only
    as needed, and every fan should prove its efficiency.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know uptime is non‑negotiable and building/plant data is
    inconsistent, incomplete, and hard to interpret.

    Authority: Field-tested analytics on real BMS/PLC logs, proven to surface
    15–40% fan kWh savings through VFDs, scheduling, setpoint, and control
    strategy optimization; secure data handling and clear M&V.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect: Securely ingest sample BMS/PLC logs or live connector.

    2) Diagnose: AI maps duty cycles, variability, and control issues;
    benchmarks energy and IAQ/pressure performance.

    3) Propose: Actionable VFD/duty/scheduling/setpoint/control changes with
    savings, payback, and utility rebate paths; optional pilot and ongoing M&V.

    Agreement Plan:

    - No disruption to operations; minimal IT lift; data privacy by design;
    cancel anytime; OEM white-label available.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo; Start a free log readiness check; Submit a
    sample dataset for a quick savings scan.

    Transitional: Download a sample audit report; Use the ROI calculator; Get
    the VFD retrofit playbook and energy code brief.
  success: >-
    - 15–40% fan energy reduction with 3–12 month payback.

    - Higher VFD and optimization attach rates; faster, data-backed sales
    cycles.

    - New aftermarket revenue with standardized retrofit kits and reports.

    - Verified savings (M&V), rebate capture, and improved ESG metrics.

    - Quieter operation, better control stability, and reduced wear.
  failure: |-
    - Continued energy waste and missed rebates.
    - Lost bids and price-only competition.
    - Higher operating costs and avoidable emissions.
    - Control instability leading to comfort/IAQ issues and downtime risk.
