  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ turnaround is slow (median 1–3 days) causing missed bid windows and
      low responsiveness to OEMs; manual cycle-time estimation and routing
      selection are bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Quote accuracy varies widely (±20–30%) leading to margin leakage on awards
      or uncompetitive pricing; historicals are underutilized or siloed.
    - >-
      GD&T and tolerance risks (true position, surface finish, datum schemes,
      SC/CC features) are missed during bid, driving late ECOs, capability
      issues, premium freight, or PPAP delays.
    - >-
      Process selection for steering/suspension parts
      (forge/cast/machine/weld/HT/coating) is inconsistent across estimators;
      tribal knowledge leaves with people.
    - >-
      Preparing quote packages (BOE, routing, cycle-time breakdowns, cost stack,
      risk log) is labor-intensive (2–8 hours/RFQ) and error-prone; data rekeyed
      across CAD, ERP, PLM, and Excel.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest 2D drawings (PDF/TIFF), 3D CAD (STEP, Parasolid, CATPart, NX),
      extract features, materials, and GD&T including SC/CC flags.
    - >-
      Auto-generate routing alternatives for typical chassis processes:
      closed-die forging or casting, rough/finish machining, welding, heat
      treat, surface treatment (phosphate, e-coat), assembly.
    - >-
      Estimate cycle times with hybrid physics + ML: toolpath-level for
      machining features (bores, tapered studs, splines, ball seats), press
      tonnage/upset for forging, oven dwell for HT, line speeds for coating.
    - >-
      Parametric cost stack: material and buy-to-fly, scrap/yield modeling, tool
      wear and changeover, labor/machine rates, utilities, overhead, logistics.
    - >-
      DFM/DFA risk engine: flags tolerance stack risks, deep bore ratios, thin
      walls, fixturing complexity, hard-facing, corrosion spec pitfalls;
      suggests design or process mitigations.
    - >-
      Historical learning: calibrate per plant using awarded quotes, actual run
      data, and NCR root causes; predicts price-to-win ranges and confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      One-click quote package: BOE, routing, cycle times, risk register,
      assumptions, markup scenarios; export to Excel/PDF and push to ERP/PLM.
    - >-
      Security and deployment: cloud or on-prem/air-gapped; SSO, role-based
      access, audit trails, TISAX/SOC2 alignment.
    - >-
      Integrations: SAP/Infor/Epicor/Plex ERP, Teamcenter/3DEXPERIENCE/Windchill
      PLM, CAM (NX CAM/Mastercam) for toolpath validation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From drawing/CAD to a defensible costed quote with manufacturability risks
    in under 60 minutes—purpose-built for steering and suspension components.
    Domain-trained AI blends feature/GD&T extraction with calibrated process
    models to increase quote accuracy, speed, and win rates while reducing
    margin leakage and PPAP risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained hybrid AI (feature/GD&T extraction + physics-informed
    costing) calibrated with steering/suspension-specific datasets from partner
    plants, plus a closed-loop feedback from PPAP/quality results. Rapid
    deployment via prebuilt commodity routings and OEM drawing-standard parsers
    delivers value in weeks, not months. On-prem, air-gapped option clears
    stringent automotive IT/security requirements.

    suspension component manufacturers (excluding springs) who want fast,
    defensible RFQ estimates and DFM risk visibility from drawings/CAD.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs stack up with complex tolerances, materials, and volumes;
    manual spreadsheets and tribal knowledge slow quotes and miss risks.

      and suspension parts (excluding springs). Instant cycle times, routing,
      cost, and tolerance risk alerts from CAD and drawings.
    ctaText: Upload a Drawing
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - RFQs take days and depend on tribal knowledge and scattered spreadsheets.
    - 'GD&T risks slip through manual reviews, causing scrap and late changes.'
    - >-
      Routing assumptions vary by estimator, creating inconsistent quotes and
      margin leakage.

      Historical run data isn’t leveraged, so similar parts are re-estimated
      from scratch.
    - Engineers are pulled into repetitive estimates instead of high-value work.
