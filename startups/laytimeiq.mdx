  problem:
    - >-
      Manual laytime and demurrage calculations are error-prone and slow,
      leading to under-recovery of valid claims and prolonged disputes.
    - >-
      Contract clauses (SHEX/SHINC, weather working days, holidays, lock delays,
      water-level clauses, ice clauses, shifting time) are complex and vary by
      counterparty; staff rely on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Evidence is fragmented across AIS, terminal logs, gate events, pump logs,
      emails, PDFs, and photos; assembling audit packs for invoicing takes days.
    - >-
      Inland-specific events (lock queues, bridge openings, river level
      restrictions, draft limits, convoy operations) are not captured
      consistently, creating claim gaps.
    - >-
      Late or incomplete invoicing increases DSO and causes claim time-bars to
      lapse.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized calculations hinders benchmarking and negotiation of
      better laytime terms.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/Voyage systems lack contract-aware automation for inland
      operations or require heavy customization.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered parser ingests contracts/CPs (PDF, email, DOCX) and maps
      clauses to a rule library (SHEX/SHINC, WWDSatExHol, waiting/anchorage,
      lock/bridge delays, weather/river level exceptions).
    - >-
      Data ingestion connectors unify AIS tracks, terminal gate/berth
      timestamps, pumping/loading logs, weigh tickets, EDI messages, email
      notices (NOR, SOF), and photos into a single timeline.
    - >-
      Deterministic rule engine plus ML to compute laytime/demurrage per
      port/stop, allocate multi-stop voyages, and apply exceptions with cited
      clause references.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection flags missing/contradictory events (e.g., berth start
      before gate-in), suggests corrections, and quantifies financial impact.
    - >-
      Automated invoice/claim generation with backup pack: timeline, clause
      citations, event evidence, counterpart-ready PDFs, and audit trail.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator to test alternative clause interpretations and
      “what-if” outcomes for negotiations and budgeting.
    - >-
      APIs and plug-ins for ERP/VMS/TMS (SAP, Oracle, Veson-like systems), DMS
      (SharePoint/Box), and P&I/legal export packages.
    - >-
      Role-based access, SOC 2/ISO 27001 controls, full audit logs, and data
      residency options (US/EU).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Contract-aware, evidence-backed laytime and demurrage automation for inland
    water freight — cutting invoice cycle time from days to hours, lifting
    recovered claims by 1–3% of freight value, and reducing disputes with
    transparent, auditable calculations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A contract-aware inland rule engine and clause library enriched with
    lock/river-level and terminal event data, trained on a proprietary corpus of
    annotated inland charter parties and audited claims, producing explainable,
    citation-backed calculations that reduce disputes—hard to replicate without
    years of data, integrations, and domain expertise.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operators, charterers, and port agents moving freight on inland waterways
    who want laytime/demurrage calculated correctly, quickly, and defensibly—so
    invoices go out on time and disputes drop.
  problem: >-
    - External: Logs, timestamps, and clauses differ by contract and port;
    manual spreadsheets miss exceptions and lose money.

    - Internal: Ops teams are stretched, second-guessing their numbers and
    dreading disputes.

    - Philosophical: Time on water should create value—not paperwork; every hour
    should be accounted for fairly and transparently.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the port-call chaos and clause confusion; we know how
    easily revenue leaks.

    - Authority: AI built for inland water freight parses logs/AIS/terminal
    reports against contract rules, with audit trails, enterprise security, and
    proven recoveries.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect data (vessel logs, AIS, terminal/agent reports). 2)
    Configure contract rules and exceptions. 3) Auto-calculate laytime/demurrage
    continuously and flag exceptions. 4) One-click generate invoices/claims and
    share audit-ready packets.

    - Agreement: Clear SLA, human-in-the-loop review, and data
    privacy/compliance baked in.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a 30-day pilot on your last 10 voyages.

    - Transitional: Get a sample audit pack and ROI estimate using your
    anonymized data.
  success: |-
    - Up to 90% faster calculations and billing
    - Fewer disputes and faster recoveries
    - Transparent, audit-ready documentation
    - Reduced revenue leakage and predictable costs
    - Happier counterparties and empowered ops teams
  failure: |-
    - Continued write-offs and cash delays
    - Escalating disputes and strained relationships
    - Regulatory and audit exposure
    - Ops burnout and missed growth
