leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned methane/CO exceedances trigger production stoppages,
      evacuations, and ignition/explosion risk; current practice is reactive and
      often identifies issues only minutes before threshold breaches.
    - >-
      TARPs are paper- or PDF-based and rely on operator judgment under time
      pressure; selecting the right trigger and action is inconsistent across
      shifts and sites.
    - >-
      Critical data (tube-bundle gas, on-board CH4 sensors, ventilation plans,
      barometric pressure, production rate, stoppages) live in silos (SCADA,
      historian, dispatch, spreadsheets) with no unified risk picture.
    - >-
      High false-alarm rates desensitize control room operators; missing a real
      exceedance can cause multi-day downtime and regulatory penalties.
    - >-
      Regulators and insurers increasingly require evidence of proactive gas
      hazard management and critical control effectiveness; mines struggle to
      quantify this proactively.
    - >-
      Ventilation and gas behavior are non-linear and site-specific; generic
      models underperform, while in-house data science is costly and hard to
      maintain at site level.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multivariate time-series forecasting that fuses gas sensors (tube-bundle,
      machine-mounted), ventilation states, production telemetry, stoppages, and
      weather/barometric forecasts to produce probabilistic exceedance risk per
      location and horizon (1–8 hours).
    - >-
      TARP Alignment Engine that maps predicted triggers to site-specific TARP
      actions with rationale, priority, and estimated risk reduction, ensuring
      consistent, auditable responses.
    - >-
      Explainable AI outputs showing key drivers (e.g., airflow reduction,
      barometric drop, cut sequence) and confidence intervals to support
      operator trust and regulator review.
    - >-
      What-if simulation to test candidate controls (e.g., increase regulator
      setting, slow shearer speed, relocate auxiliary fan) and forecast the
      impact on exceedance probability before acting.
    - >-
      Edge-capable deployment for low-latency inference in control rooms, with
      cloud model training and secure historian/SCADA connectors.
    - >-
      Operator workflow with acknowledgement, escalation, and auto-logging to
      demonstrate TARP compliance and critical control effectiveness.
    - >-
      Data quality layer that flags sensor drift/failure, data gaps, and
      conflicting readings; automated fallbacks to maintain service continuity.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 90-day pilot with baselined KPIs, site
      calibration, user training, and regulator engagement to accelerate
      adoption.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    officers who must keep gas within limits while delivering production.
  problem: >-
    External — Methane/CO spikes emerge quickly; data is fragmented across
    monitors, ventilation, and equipment; TARP responses lag, causing
    withdrawals and downtime. Internal — Constant pressure to decide early with
    incomplete information; fear of missing a trigger or overreacting.
    Philosophical — People should go home safe, and safe production shouldn’t
    rely on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the stakes of underground gas management. Our team blends
    coal‑mine operations and ML expertise to forecast exceedance risk 1–8 hours
    ahead and suggest TARP‑consistent controls. Built to fit existing TARP
    wording and workflows, with transparent rationale and an audit trail to
    support confidence with crews and regulators.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect live gas, ventilation, equipment, and geological data plus your
    site TARP. 2) View rolling 1–8h risk forecasts by panel/zone with trigger
    alerts. 3) Apply recommended TARP actions, capture approvals/notes, and
    review outcomes to tune the site model.

  success: >-
    Proactive control of gas; fewer exceedances and withdrawals; faster,
    defensible decisions; confident TARP compliance; improved production
    continuity; clear audit trail; stronger safety culture.
  failure: >-
    Reactive firefighting; surprise exceedances; costly trips and evacuations;
    investigations and fines; eroded trust and production losses.
