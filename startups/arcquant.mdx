  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 6–12 hours per tank job manually tallying weld symbols
      and lengths from 2D PDFs/DWGs, delaying quotes by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Human takeoffs miss 5–15% of weld inches due to scattered symbols, unclear
      callouts, and drawing revisions, causing underestimation and margin
      erosion.
    - >-
      Consumable forecasting (wire/rod/flux/gas) is inconsistent; many shops
      rely on rules of thumb, leading to 8–20% stockouts or excess inventory.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced welding estimators/engineers increases cycle time
      and training burden; new hires need months to become reliable at takeoffs.
    - >-
      Disconnected systems: takeoffs live in spreadsheets and do not map to
      WPS/PQR or ERP/MES, limiting traceability and repeatability.
    - >-
      Customers and EPCs increasingly demand faster, data-backed bids and firm
      delivery/consumable plans; shops risk losing bids when they can’t turn
      estimates quickly.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven drawing parser ingests PDF/DWG/DXF; detects and classifies AWS
      A2.4 weld symbols (fillet, groove, size, contour, finishing) and
      associated geometry/notes.
    - >-
      Calculates weld inches and weld volume from symbol parameters, joint
      types, thickness, and scale; applies deposition efficiency and operator
      factors by process (SMAW/GMAW/FCAW/SAW).
    - >-
      Maps detected joints to customer WPS/PQR library and filler metal catalogs
      to produce wire/rod/flux/gas usage, including waste factors and
      spool/packaging counts.
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop review with redline overlays;
      quick edit tools update quantities and retrain models.
    - >-
      Exports standardized estimate to CSV/Excel, Tekla EPM/ERP (Epicor,
      JobBOSS, Global Shop), and generates a one-click quote appendix with
      weld-inch breakdown and assumptions.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboards benchmark estimate vs. as-built (if data available)
      to continuously calibrate factors and improve accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut tank weld takeoff time by 80–90% and standardize consumable planning by
    automatically extracting weld symbols/geometry from drawings, mapping to
    WPS/PQR, and producing auditable weld-inch and consumable estimates with
    measurable accuracy.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from customer as-built data (ERP/MES weld-inch and
    consumable actuals) plus per-shop calibration tied to WPS/PQR libraries,
    creating a defensible dataset and performance gap others can’t easily
    replicate.

  character: >-
    Estimators, project managers, and fabrication leads at heavy‑gauge metal
    tank manufacturers (NAICS 332420) who need fast, defensible weld and
    consumable estimates from complex drawings.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual takeoffs from AWS A2.4 weld symbols and geometry are
    slow, inconsistent, and easy to miss.

    - Internal: Teams worry bids, labor plans, and consumable orders are off.

    - Philosophical: Building critical tanks shouldn’t rely on highlighters and
    hunches.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand code-stamped tank work, heavy plate joints, WPS
    constraints, and shop realities.

    - Authority: Our AI reads AWS A2.4 symbols and geometry to produce
    consistent weld-inch totals and consumable forecasts, with audit-ready
    outputs and ERP/CAD integrations.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload PDFs/DXF (or connect your PDM).

    2) AI extracts weld symbols/geometry, computes weld inches, passes,
    wire/rod, flux/gas, and labor assumptions.

    3) Review and adjust WPS parameters, then export to BOM/ERP and attach to
    the quote.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a 2‑week pilot on a current job.

    - Transitional: Book a 20‑minute demo or upload a sample drawing for a free
    estimate.
  success: >-
    Quote in minutes, not days; consistent weld-inch totals; right-sized
    consumable orders; tighter, more competitive bids; higher win rates; fewer
    change orders; protected margins; on-time shipments; audit-ready
    traceability.
  failure: >-
    Staying with manual takeoffs risks missed welds, over/under-buying
    consumables, overtime and rework, blown schedules, margin erosion, and lost
    bids.
