  problem:
    - >-
      Suboptimal planter setup (downforce, vacuum, seed disk, singulation)
      causes uneven emergence and 2–6 bu/ac yield loss in corn and 1–3 bu/ac in
      soybeans.
    - >-
      Operators lose 4–10 hours per planter at season start and after weather
      changes due to trial-and-error calibration and consulting manuals or
      videos.
    - >-
      Variability in seed size, residue, moisture, and soil texture makes OEM
      defaults unreliable; operators lack a fast, condition-specific starting
      point.
    - >-
      Mixed fleets and differing monitors (Deere, Case IH, AGCO, Precision
      Planting, Trimble, Ag Leader) create knowledge gaps and inconsistent setup
      across machines.
    - >-
      High seasonal labor turnover increases training burden and setup errors;
      checklists are rarely standardized or auditable.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across monitors, agronomy apps, and spreadsheets, making it
      hard to learn from past seasons and replicate what worked.
    - >-
      Replant risk and downtime from preventable issues (plugged meters, poor
      residue management, wrong closing-wheel pressure) reduce margins.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile and web app that ingests seed size, hybrid, target population, soil
      texture/compaction, moisture, residue cover, and forecast; outputs
      machine-specific settings for meters, vacuum/air, downforce, depth,
      closing system, and ground speed.
    - >-
      Auto-generated monitor profiles (ISOBUS-compatible) and step-by-step setup
      checklists with photos and torque specs for each planter row unit and
      accessory.
    - >-
      On-device calibration assistant: camera-based seed size estimation,
      singulation test workflow, and suggested changes with expected impact
      (e.g., vacuum +1 inHg yields +0.3% singulation).
    - >-
      Real-time field adjustment prompts using telematics and monitor data
      (speed vs. ride quality vs. singulation tradeoffs).
    - >-
      Compliance-quality logs for what settings were applied, by whom, when, and
      where (GPS-tagged), exportable to Operations Center/Climate/Ag Leader.
    - >-
      Playbooks for soil prep and residue management (tillage pass,
      down-pressure recommendations, residue managers), tuned by weather
      windows.
    - >-
      Offline-first operation with sync when connectivity returns; multilingual
      support for seasonal crews.
    - >-
      Post-plant analytics tying settings to emergence imagery and yield to
      create field- and hybrid-specific baselines for next year.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, cross-OEM planter setup that converts seed, soil, residue, and
    weather inputs into precise, field-ready settings and checklists—cutting
    setup time by 50%, reducing replant by 10–25%, and capturing 2–6 bu/ac in
    corn through consistent emergence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, condition-specific recommendation engine trained on a growing,
    proprietary dataset of settings-to-outcomes pairs, enriched by dealer
    telemetry and emergence/yield labels; on-device inference and camera-based
    seed sizing enable fast, offline setup; dealer certification program embeds
    the workflow into preseason service packages, creating distribution lock-in
    and high switching costs.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Row-crop farmers and operators who want fast, confident planter setup for
    every field to hit emergence and yield targets.
  problem: >-
    Villain: complexity and variability. External: changing seed sizes, residue,
    moisture, soil types, and mixed fleets cause poor placement and uneven
    stands. Internal: second-guessing during tight planting windows.
    Philosophical: you shouldn’t lose yield because setup is guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we know short weather windows and complex planters make perfect
    setup hard. Authority: AI trained on agronomy best practices, OEM specs,
    local conditions, and your machine history delivers precise, field-specific
    recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Enter seed, field, residue, and equipment details. 2) Get a tailored
    setup: depth, downforce, row cleaners, closing, singulation, speed,
    fertilizer, monitor alarms/settings, and printable checklists. 3) Calibrate
    and verify with guided in-field checks and real-time prompts; save profiles
    per field and crop.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a Field Setup and connect your monitor. Transitional: Download
    the Pre-Plant Checklist and sample recommendations; book a 10‑minute
    onboarding.
  success: >-
    Uniform emergence, accurate population and spacing, clean furrow and
    closure, optimized speed, fewer stops, documented settings and checklists,
    repeatable per-field setups, higher yield and ROI, peace of mind.
  failure: >-
    Guesswork settings, skips/doubles, sidewall compaction, replanting, wasted
    seed and time, missed weather windows, preventable yield loss.
