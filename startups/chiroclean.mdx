leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chiropractic offices experience 10–20% first-pass payer denials due to
      missing/incorrect AT modifiers, non-covered services billed to Medicare,
      or absent subluxation diagnoses (M99.0x).
    - >-
      Generic scrubbing tools flag X12 format errors but miss
      chiropractic-specific policy edits (e.g., MAC LCDs, BCBS policies on 9894x
      units, maintenance care exclusions).
    - >-
      Office staff spend 3–7 minutes per encounter manually coding CPT/ICD-10,
      adding modifiers, and assembling claim lines; errors scale with volume.
    - >-
      EHR data are inconsistently structured; SOAP notes contain key clinical
      detail that doesn’t map cleanly to 837P loops/segments without manual
      copying.
    - >-
      Small clinics lack dedicated billing expertise and rely on clearinghouse
      rejections as feedback, causing 7–14 day reimbursement delays and
      increased Days in A/R.
    - >-
      Timely filing and payer-specific requirements (taxonomy 111N00000X, place
      of service, rendering vs billing NPI, supervising requirements by payer)
      are inconsistently applied, leading to preventable denials.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest encounter data and SOAP notes via EHR integration, CSV upload, or
      API; normalize patient, provider, insurance, and encounter metadata.
    - >-
      AI coding assistant maps documented findings to appropriate CPT (e.g.,
      98940–98942), ICD-10-CM (e.g., M99.0x for subluxation), and payer-required
      modifiers (AT for Medicare), with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Chiropractic-specific rules engine applies national and payer/MAC
      policies: coverage, units/time rules, diagnosis-to-procedure validation,
      maintenance vs active treatment checks, taxonomy/pos validation, and SNIP
      1–7 X12 validations.
    - >-
      Auto-builds compliant 837P 005010X222A1 files with correct loops/segments
      (billing/rendering provider NPIs, subscriber/guardian logic, claim-level
      and line-level details).
    - >-
      Pre-flight clearinghouse checks and payer-specific edit simulation; flags
      and explains fixes before submission.
    - >-
      One-click export to clearinghouse (SFTP/API) or download; optional
      999/277CA monitoring via integrations.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: updates rules from denial reason codes (CARC/RARC)
      and user corrections to improve clinic-specific accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native, chiropractic-specific claim scrubbing and 837P file generation
    that converts SOAP encounters into clean claims, applies payer/LCD edits
    before submission, and achieves >98.5% clearinghouse acceptance with
    measurable denial reduction—without changing your EHR or clearinghouse.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Chiropractic-specialized rules and models continuously improved by
    cross-clinic denial feedback loops and payer policy ingestion, plus native
    integrations with top chiropractic EHRs—delivering payer-specific, LCD-aware
    scrubbing beyond generic clearinghouse edits.
