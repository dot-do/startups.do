  problem:
    - >-
      Packaging/label reviews for confectionery SKUs are slow (5–15
      days/iteration) and error-prone due to manual checks across US/EU/UK
      regulations.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity and divergence (EU 1169/2011, UK FIC retained law,
      US 21 CFR 101; recent changes like EU E171 ban, US sesame allergen)
      outpace in-house teams.
    - >-
      Artwork files often deviate from approved specs (font sizes, QUID,
      allergens, polyol warnings) and issues are caught late—triggering rework,
      missed launch windows, or costly scrappage.
    - >-
      Generalist tools don’t understand confectionery-specific rules (e.g.,
      “chocolate” compositional naming, compound coatings, polyol laxative
      warning, cocoa solids %, “sugar-free”/“no added sugar” thresholds).
    - >-
      Exporting to multiple markets multiplies risk—claims acceptable in US fail
      in EU/UK and vice versa; internal teams lack a single source of truth and
      audit trail.
  solution:
    - >-
      OCR and parse final artwork (AI-enhanced OCR tuned for curved packs/foil
      glare) to extract ingredient lists, allergens, nutrition tables,
      front-of-pack claims, and mandatory statements.
    - >-
      Rules engine + knowledge graph mapped to confectionery (EU 1169/2011,
      1924/2006, 1333/2008, 2000/36/EC; UK retained law and FSA guidance; US 21
      CFR 101, FALCPA, FASTER Act) with product-type logic (chocolate vs
      compound coating; milk/dark/white; fillings/coatings).
    - >-
      Automated redlines on PDFs/AI files: highlight missing/incorrect elements
      (e.g., QUID for characterizing ingredients like cocoa solids; polyol
      warning if >10%; font size for x-height; “sesame” in bold in US/UK/EU).
    - >-
      Claim validation: flag prohibited/misleading or market-specific qualifiers
      (e.g., “sugar-free” thresholds; “no artificial colors”; vegan claims where
      shellac/glazing agents present; HFSS-related marketing impacts in UK).
    - >-
      Market divergence check: one-click US/EU/UK comparison with pass/fail
      matrix and specific citations; suggest variant text per market.
    - >-
      Evidence-backed checklist: exportable CSV/PDF with clause references,
      screenshots, and risk severity; audit trail and version control.
    - >-
      Integrations: Esko WebCenter/ArtiosCAD, Adobe CC, PLM/Spec (SAP, Oracle,
      Specright), DAMs; API for CI/CD-style label checks on file upload.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: optional expert review add-on for edge cases; built-in
      query to partner regulatory attorneys with 48h SLA.
    - >-
      Change impact alerts: when regulations update (e.g., additive bans), flag
      affected SKUs/artworks and propose corrective text.
    - >-
      Performance/SLA: <60s single-panel check; <3 min full pack; 99.9% uptime;
      encryption + SOC 2 roadmap.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, confectionery-specific label compliance from final artwork:
    detect and redline non-compliance in minutes across US/EU/UK with
    legally-cited checklists—cut review cycles 50%, reduce recall risk, and
    accelerate seasonal launches.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Confectionery-first rules/ontology and artwork-trained models with legally
    cited redlines—fed by a growing corpus of annotated confectionery packaging
    and post-market outcomes—create a defensible feedback loop and higher
    precision than generalist label tools.

    We are food-label compliance specialists. Our AI is trained on US/EU/UK regs
    to OCR your artwork and flag issues with citations, redlines, and a
    defensible audit trail, plus optional expert review.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload artwork and supplier specs. 2) AI OCR cross-checks ingredients,
    nutrition, and claims; returns redlines and a market-specific fix checklist
    with citations. 3) Edit and re-check to greenlight; export an approval pack.
    Secure, no IT needed.
