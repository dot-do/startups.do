leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented regulations across AAFCO (US) and EU/FEDIAF cause inconsistent
      labels and claims, leading to legal exposure and costly relabels.
    - >-
      Manual label creation and review consume 6–20 hours per SKU and require
      scarce regulatory expertise, slowing launches by 2–6 weeks.
    - >-
      Ingredient names often don’t match AAFCO-defined names or EU
      Catalogue/Feed Material Register descriptors, creating non-compliant
      ingredient statements.
    - >-
      Claims (e.g., “grain-free,” “hypoallergenic,” “improves coat health”) are
      used without substantiation and may trigger FDA warning letters, FTC
      scrutiny, or EU non-compliance under Reg. (EC) 767/2009 and FEDIAF
      guidance.
    - >-
      Multi-market packaging (US + EU) multiplies complexity: different
      mandatory statements, GA/analytical constituents, additives declaration,
      and language requirements.
    - >-
      Frequent updates (e.g., AAFCO Model Regulations changes, FEDIAF labelling
      code updates, additives authorizations/restrictions) are hard to track
      across portfolios >100 SKUs.
    - >-
      Translation/localization errors (multi-language EU labels) cause claims
      drift and mislabelling; packaging real estate constraints make mandatory
      text overflow common.
    - >-
      Co-manufacturers and private-label brands struggle to align formulation,
      PLM/ERP data, and label copy, creating version-control risk and audit
      gaps.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted label composer that converts formulation/spec data to
      compliant ingredient lists, GA/analytical constituents, and mandatory
      statements for US (AAFCO) and EU (Reg. 767/2009, FEDIAF).
    - >-
      Automated claims classifier that flags risky or prohibited claims and maps
      each allowed claim to substantiation requirements and evidence
      placeholders.
    - >-
      Jurisdictional rule engine: species-, life-stage-, and
      presentation-specific checks (treat vs. complete feed; additives
      declaration; feed material names; calorie content statements; net
      quantity; business name/address; lot code; feeding directions).
    - >-
      Multi-language output for EU with controlled terminology; layout assistant
      that ensures mandatory text sizes and hierarchy fit packaging real estate.
    - >-
      Continuous regulatory watch: alerts on AAFCO/FEDIAF updates, EU additive
      authorization changes, guidance updates—plus impact analysis on SKUs.
    - >-
      Audit-ready version control with change logs, reasoning traces, and
      exportable compliance dossiers for internal QA and regulators/retailers.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to common PLM/ERP/DAM systems to sync formulations,
      specs, and artwork assets.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop pathways: built-in expert review marketplace and redline
      workflows for final sign-off.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate and validate AAFCO- and EU/FEDIAF-compliant labels and ingredient
    statements in minutes—with automated claims/warnings checks, traceable
    evidence, and one-click multi-market packaging output—reducing review time
    by 70–90% and cutting relabel risk by >50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, machine-readable feed-labelling rule graph plus a
    proprietary corpus of formulation-to-label mappings and adjudicated claims
    gives superior accuracy and rapid update cycles; formal licensing
    relationships (e.g., AAFCO) and deep PLM integrations create switching costs
    and a defensible data moat.
