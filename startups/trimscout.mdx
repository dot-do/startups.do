leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Long lead times to source accessories: typical supplier discovery + RFI
      cycle is 3–6 weeks; teams need qualified shortlists in <7 days to hit
      seasonal calendars.
    - >-
      Low RFI response/fit rates: <30% of outbound RFIs get complete responses;
      of those, <40% fit MOQ/lead-time/compliance requirements, causing repeated
      outreach.
    - >-
      Fragmented, stale supplier data: brand teams rely on trade shows,
      spreadsheets, Google/Alibaba; factory info (capacity, audits, machinery)
      is unverified or outdated.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone quote comparison: RFQ normalization across currencies,
      incoterms, trims, and packaging specs consumes 8–12 hours per project.
    - >-
      Compliance and ESG risk: verifying WRAP/SEDEX/BSCI/ISO certificates,
      restricted substances, and PFC-free status is manual; 1 missed
      non-compliance can delay launch or trigger chargebacks.
    - >-
      Language and time-zone barriers reduce speed and accuracy of technical
      clarifications; translation and follow-ups add 1–3 days per iteration.
    - >-
      Disjointed tooling: PLM/BOM data isn’t connected to supplier discovery;
      requirements are inconsistently communicated, driving misquotes and
      sampling waste.
    - >-
      Hidden landed-cost drivers: duties, tariffs, and freight volatility aren’t
      modeled early; suppliers chosen on EXW price later fail on total cost
      targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Global accessory supplier graph indexed by capability (zippers, buttons,
      labels, elastics, packaging), machinery, MOQ, lead time, certifications,
      and historical export data.
    - >-
      AI-assisted RFI/RFQ workflow that ingests tech packs/BOMs from PLM,
      generates multilingual RFIs, routes to best-fit factories, and nudges
      follow-ups for higher response rates.
    - >-
      Automated quote normalization and landed-cost modeling across currencies,
      incoterms, tariffs, and logistics to compare apples-to-apples.
    - >-
      Supplier scoring engine with weighted criteria (cost, quality, capacity,
      lead time, ESG/compliance, geographic risk) aligned to project
      requirements.
    - >-
      Compliance verification pipeline ingesting WRAP/SEDEX/BSCI/ISO/Higg data,
      sanction screening, and certificate validity checks.
    - >-
      Project pipeline and vendor onboarding: manage NDAs, samples, approvals,
      and performance tracking from scouting to PO handoff.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut supplier scouting and RFI/RFQ cycle time from weeks to days for apparel
    accessories. TrimScout AI finds, verifies, and scores factories against your
    BOM and compliance needs, automates multilingual RFIs, normalizes quotes to
    landed cost, and delivers a ranked, audit-ready shortlist within 72 hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Accessory-specific supplier knowledge graph combining customs flows,
    capability/machinery extraction, verified audits, and anonymized quote
    benchmarks—improving matching precision over generic marketplaces.
    Multilingual RFI automation with translation memory and outreach sequencing
    tuned on accessory suppliers lifts response rates. Early partnerships with
    PLM vendors embed us in existing BOM workflows, raising switching costs.
    Network effects: every RFQ enriches benchmarks and supplier response
    patterns, compounding accuracy.

    Process plan: 1) Define requirements (materials, MOQ, certifications, lead
    time, target cost). 2) AI scouts and shortlists global factories. 3)
    Auto-send RFIs/RFQs and manage samples. 4) Score responses and risks against
    your criteria. 5) Award, onboard, and monitor. Agreement plan: Transparent
    scoring, data privacy safeguarded, you approve every outreach.
