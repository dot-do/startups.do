  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent late deliveries and sudden supplier outages in 336999 cause
      expensive line-stops and expedited shipping; most firms lack early-warning
      signals beyond past on-time performance (OTD).
    - >-
      Compliance exposure to sanctions/export controls (OFAC, BIS Entity List,
      EU/UK lists, ITAR/EAR) is rising, but screening is episodic and manual,
      leaving gaps for indirect and tier-2 parties.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into supplier financial fragility (e.g., liquidity
      squeezes, credit downgrades), especially among small/mid suppliers,
      increases risk of unplanned single-sourcing failures.
    - >-
      ESG incidents (forced labor/UFLPA, environmental violations at
      plating/anodizing facilities, unsafe labor practices) are difficult to
      detect across languages and local sources, risking brand and regulatory
      penalties.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, SRM, PLM, spreadsheets) prevents a consolidated,
      explainable view of delivery risk, compliance status, and mitigation
      actions per supplier and per BoM.
    - >-
      Procurement/quality teams spend high effort on periodic audits and
      questionnaires (e.g., conflict minerals, REACH/RoHS, battery regulations)
      with low supplier response rates and poor evidence quality.
    - >-
      No standardized, sector-specific risk scoring framework for 336999
      components (engines, drivetrains, batteries, plastics/electronics), making
      risk prioritization inconsistent across teams.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest first-party data (POs, ASNs, GRs, quality NCRs, OTD)
      and third-party data (credit, sanctions/export lists, trade filings, ESG
      incident feeds) to compute a multi-dimensional supplier risk score
      specific to 336999 categories.
    - >-
      Watchlist and export-control screening across suppliers, beneficial
      owners, logistics intermediaries, and high-risk tier-2s with automated
      re-screening and adverse media NLP in 15+ languages.
    - >-
      ESG and regulatory library tailored to 336999 (UFLPA, conflict
      minerals/3TG, REACH/RoHS, EU Battery Regulation 2023/1542, CARB SORE/EPA
      small engine emissions, Prop 65, CE/Machinery Directive) with evidence
      capture and renewal reminders.
    - >-
      Early-warning delivery risk models that combine fill-rate/OTD trends,
      lead-time variance, shipment anomalies, capacity/utilization signals, and
      macro/geopolitical disruptions to produce preventive alerts 2–8 weeks
      earlier than status quo.
    - >-
      BoM-to-supplier mapping with single/dual-source concentration analytics
      and recommended mitigations (e.g., qualified alternates, safety stock
      changes, expedite vs. re-source tradeoffs).
    - >-
      Workflow for supplier remediation: assign corrective actions, request
      documents (certs, MSDS, test reports), trigger audits, and track closure
      SLAs; all steps are time-stamped for compliance.
    - >-
      Integrations with SAP (ECC/S4), Oracle, Infor, Epicor, IFS; procurement
      suites (Ariba, Coupa, Jaggaer); PLM (Teamcenter, Windchill); SSO and
      API-first architecture.
    - >-
      Executive dashboards quantifying risk-adjusted supply assurance (e.g., %
      BoM at risk, expected days of cover impacted, potential revenue-at-risk)
      and compliance posture (screening coverage, incidents by severity).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A continuous, explainable supplier risk and compliance radar purpose-built
    for NAICS 336999 that fuses delivery, financial, sanctions/export, and ESG
    signals into actionable, BoM-level early warnings with automated mitigations
    and audit-ready evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical focus: a pre-trained, explainable risk model and regulatory library
    tailored to 336999 parts and workflows; proprietary tier-n supplier graph
    from trade/shipment co-occurrence; integration templates for common ERPs in
