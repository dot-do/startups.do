leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven traceability across ARP4754A → DO-178C/DO-254
      artifacts is slow (often 20–40% of total certification effort) and
      error-prone, creating schedule and audit risk.
    - >-
      Disparate tools (DOORS/Polarion/Jama, Git/GitLab/Bitbucket,
      SCADE/Simulink, LDRA/VectorCAST, HDL simulators, test management) lack
      reliable, cross-domain end-to-end linkage and change impact analysis.
    - >-
      Late discovery of missing links, obsolete tests, and incomplete
      verification evidence causes expensive rework and recertification churn.
    - >-
      Certification data pack assembly for Stage of Involvement (SOI) audits is
      labor-intensive; audit findings often stem from inconsistent trace and
      inadequate coverage evidence.
    - >-
      Tool qualification (DO-330) is costly and delays adoption of
      automation/AI, limiting potential efficiency gains.
    - >-
      Security and export controls (ITAR/EAR), and air-gapped environments
      complicate cloud/SaaS adoption and integrations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize artifacts from ALM/PLM/SCM/test tools into a
      versioned safety case knowledge graph (requirements, design models,
      code/HDL, tests/results, problem reports, conformity data).
    - >-
      Use domain-tuned AI to recommend and validate trace links
      (HLR↔LLR↔code/HDL↔tests↔evidence), with confidence scoring and
      human-in-the-loop approval workflow.
    - >-
      Continuously detect gaps (missing links, stale tests, orphan requirements,
      unmet DO-178C objective coverage) and quantify change impact on
      upstream/downstream artifacts.
    - >-
      Auto-generate certification data packages (trace matrices, coverage
      reports, compliance checklists, SOI readiness kits) aligned with
      ARP4754A/DO-178C/DO-254 objectives.
    - >-
      Provide a DO-330 tool qualification kit (TQP/TQR/TQL rationale,
      verification cases) to accelerate acceptance of AI-assisted workflows.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: air-gapped on-prem appliance or VPC with data
      residency, role-based access control, immutable audit logs, and export
      control safeguards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-qualified, end-to-end certification traceability that halves
    time-to-audit: a secure, program-aware knowledge graph linking ARP4754A
    system safety artifacts to DO-178C/DO-254 requirements, code/HDL, tests, and
    verification evidence with continuous gap detection, impact analysis, and
    ready-to-submit data packs—deployable on-prem or in a compliant VPC with
    DO-330 tool qualification kit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Certification managers, DERs, and systems/software/hardware engineering
    leads at NAICS 334511 manufacturers who must prove DO-178C/DO-254/ARP4754A
    compliance for safety-critical avionics and maritime systems under tight
    schedules and audits.
  problem: >-
    Manual, spreadsheet-driven traceability and verification create blind spots
    and audit risk: missing links from HLR/LLR to code, tests, and evidence;
    unclear change impact; duplicated effort; and late-stage noncompliances
    during SOI 1–4.
  guide: >-
    An AI certification co-pilot built by experienced certification engineers
    that automates end-to-end traceability, gap detection, and standards-aligned
    checks—producing audit-ready packages while keeping humans-in-the-loop.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest requirements, models, code/HDL repos, tests, coverage,
    and verification results; 2) Map: auto-build bidirectional trace with
    coverage metrics and gap flags against DO-178C/DO-254/ARP4754A objectives;
    3) Verify & Report: run checks, guide remediation, and generate SOI-ready
    evidence; 4) Sustain: monitor changes in CI/CD and perform guided impact
    analysis.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute compliance assessment. Transitional: Start a
    sandbox pilot with a redacted project to see auto-trace and gap reports
    within days.
  success: >-
    A living, audit-ready traceability matrix; instant gap and impact reports;
    fewer findings at SOI reviews; shorter certification cycles; preserved
    engineering knowledge; consistent compliance across teams and suppliers.
  failure: >-
    Missed objectives, late rework, schedule slips, cost overruns, audit
    findings at SOI reviews, delayed approvals, and lost bids due to brittle,
    manual traceability.
