leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Digitized backlogs grow faster than staff capacity; typical cataloger
      throughput is 15–30 items/day, leaving 10k–1M item backlogs for large
      institutions.
    - >-
      Manual description takes 8–20 minutes per item for titles, dates, names,
      places, subjects; at $35–$60/hour fully loaded cost, per-item description
      costs $4.50–$20.
    - >-
      Authority control (LCNAF/VIAF/ISNI/ORCID) is inconsistent and
      time-consuming; match rates can be under 60% without tooling, reducing
      discovery quality.
    - >-
      Subject assignment (LCSH, FAST, AAT) is laborious and inconsistent; lack
      of confidence metrics makes QA difficult.
    - >-
      Legacy systems require clean exports to MARC/MODS/DC/EAD; crosswalk errors
      lead to rework, ingest failures, and audit issues.
    - >-
      Multi-language OCR/HTR and historical scripts (Gothic, Fraktur, cursive)
      are error-prone, especially for archival materials.
    - >-
      Lack of measurable QA: teams cannot quantify precision/recall, authority
      match rates, or reviewer acceptance; grants require defensible metrics.
    - >-
      Compliance and privacy needs (e.g., PII redaction from OCR text) are
      under-served in generic AI tools.
    - >-
      Local vocabularies and variant forms (e.g., local name/subject headings)
      are hard to reconcile with standards without custom rules.
    - >-
      Existing tools are fragmented; building in-house pipelines (OCR + NER +
      reconciliation + crosswalks) takes months and is brittle.
    - >-
      Budget predictability is hard under per-hour consulting models; leaders
      need transparent per-item or tiered pricing.
    - >-
      Integrations with Alma, WorldShare, ArchivesSpace, DSpace, Fedora,
      Islandora, and ContentDM are nontrivial and slow projects.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest pipelines for IIIF, OAI-PMH, S3/Blob, local SMB/NFS shares, and
      repository connectors (Alma, WorldShare, ArchivesSpace,
      DSpace/Fedora/Islandora, ContentDM).
    - >-
      Adaptive OCR/HTR selection per material type (printed vs. manuscript),
      with language detection and model switching; support for Latin, Cyrillic,
      Arabic, CJK, Hebrew, and historical scripts.
    - >-
      Named Entity Recognition for titles, personal/corporate names, places,
      dates, subjects; trained on library/archival corpora.
    - >-
      Entity resolution to LCNAF, VIAF, ISNI, ORCID, GeoNames, Getty AAT/TGN,
      and Wikidata with confidence scores and variant name handling.
    - >-
      Subject suggestion models aligned to LCSH/FAST/AAT and configurable for
      local vocabularies; transparent confidence thresholds.
    - >-
      Date parsing and normalization to EDTF/ISO 8601 with qualifiers
      (approximate, uncertain, inferred) and range handling.
    - >-
      Geocoding with coordinates, historical name variants, and jurisdiction
      hierarchies for improved spatial discovery.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI with keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions,
      sampling strategies, and inter-rater agreement metrics.
    - >-
      PII detection and optional redaction in OCR text; rights statements
      mapping (RightsStatements.org) with templates.
    - >-
      Export mappers and validators to MARC21 (e.g., 245/100/6XX/650/651/7XX),
      MODS, Dublin Core, EAD, and JSON-LD; crosswalk unit tests to prevent
      regressions.
    - >-
      Batch scheduler with retries, lineage/audit trail, and reproducible runs;
      SSO (SAML/OIDC) and RBAC for governance.
    - >-
      Dashboards for backlog, throughput, precision/recall, authority match
      rates, reviewer acceptance, and export error rates.
    - >-
      Deployment options: multi-tenant SaaS with regional data residency or
      on-premises containers (Kubernetes/VM) with no internet dependency if
      required.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built, human-in-the-loop AI that reduces description time per item
    by 60–80% while improving authority control and subject consistency. Batch
    process tens of thousands of items with measurable quality (e.g., 90%+
    precision on named entities), export natively to MARC21/MODS/DC/EAD, and
    integrate with Alma, WorldShare, ArchivesSpace, DSpace/Fedora. Available as
    SaaS or on-prem with procurement-ready security and auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned stack built with consortium-shared training data and
    crosswalk rulebooks unavailable to generic AI vendors; human-in-the-loop
    workflows that continuously improve models; deep standards compliance
    (MARC/MODS/DC/EAD, EDTF) and certified integrations with
    Alma/WorldShare/ArchivesSpace/DSpace that shorten deployments from months to
    weeks; procurement readiness (on-prem option, SOC 2 roadmap, accessibility)
    and published third-party benchmarks that make quality and ROI transparent.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Libraries and archives with digitized backlogs who need fast,
    standards‑compliant metadata at scale.
  problem: >-
    Backlogs and inconsistent minimal records hide collections; manual
    cataloging is slow, costly, and weak on authority control and crosswalks.
  guide: >-
    We understand cataloging pressures and bring AI plus metadata standards
    expertise to extract, enrich, and authority‑link reliably.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest batches or connect your repository; 2) AI extracts
    titles/dates/names/places/subjects, links authorities, suggests subjects; 3)
    You review/QA and export MARC/MODS/DC for import.
  callToAction: Start a pilot batch or book a 30‑minute demo with a free sample export.
  success: >-
    Clean, consistent, authority‑linked records delivered 10x faster, better
    discovery and interoperability, and staff time freed for high‑value work.
  failure: >-
    Persistent backlogs, inconsistent records, poor discovery and reporting,
    increased costs, and staff burnout.
