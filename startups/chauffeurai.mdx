leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Missed and abandoned after-hours inquiries: many limo operators miss
      20–40% of calls/texts after 6pm, losing high-margin airport and
      last-minute jobs.
    - >-
      High labor costs for 24/7 coverage: staffing dispatchers or using call
      centers costs $6,000–$12,000/month for reliable overnight/weekend
      coverage.
    - >-
      Slow, inconsistent quoting: manual rate lookups and inconsistent
      application of fees/OT wait times create 5–10% revenue leakage and poor
      CX.
    - >-
      Fragmented channels: phone, web form, and SMS aren’t unified; slow
      responses to web leads (minutes–hours) reduce conversion vs. instant
      quotes (<10 seconds).
    - >-
      Limited integration: most answering services can take messages but can’t
      price accurately or book directly into dispatch (double entry, errors).
    - >-
      Payment friction: card collection over phone is error-prone and insecure;
      failed/declined payments cause no-shows and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Scaling issues: operators can’t easily scale for spikes (weather, flight
      disruptions, event surges) without overstaffing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel AI agent: instant answering on phone, web chat, and SMS with
      consistent persona and context sharing.
    - >-
      Quote engine hooked to your rate tables: base, per-mile/min, zone-to-zone,
      wait time, gratuity, tolls, surcharges, promos, and corporate pricing;
      uses live maps/ETA.
    - >-
      End-to-end booking: collect rider/passenger details, flight info, stops,
      notes; confirm policies; create/modify/cancel trips directly in dispatch.
    - >-
      Secure payments: PCI-compliant links/DTMF masking to collect deposits/full
      payment; tokenize cards on file; handle refunds/adjustments.
    - >-
      Human failover: smart transfer to on-call dispatcher for edge cases or
      VIPs; full transcript/context passed to human.
    - >-
      Flight and delay handling: pull flight status, adjust pickup times and
      wait fees per operator rules, proactive SMS updates.
    - >-
      Analytics and QA: dashboard for answer rates, conversion, AHT, revenue
      captured, misquote alerts, transcript search, and model improvement loop.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss a booking. An industry-trained AI that answers in ~2 seconds on
    phone, web, and SMS, delivers accurate quotes from your rate tables,
    securely takes payment, and books directly into your dispatch system—with
    human handoff when needed and 24/7 reliability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep, production-grade integrations with leading livery dispatch systems and
    a growing, proprietary dataset of livery-specific conversations and rate
    rules, enabling higher quoting accuracy and end-to-end booking—capabilities
    generic AI/answering services lack. Combined with PCI-compliant payment
    capture and human failover, this creates a defensible performance and trust
    moat.
