  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers arrive with inspiration images (Pinterest/Instagram/screenshots)
      and staff spend 5–15 minutes per request hunting for close matches across
      color, scale, and print.
    - >-
      Online search is text-based; fabric attributes (scale of print, color
      nuance, sheen, weave) are hard to describe with keywords, causing poor
      discovery and lost sales.
    - >-
      Inventory turns suffer on long-tail SKUs because they’re hard to surface
      when customers don’t know exact names/collections.
    - >-
      Product images vary by lighting and background; color inconsistencies
      across suppliers lead to mismatched expectations and returns.
    - >-
      Retailers lack a simple, measurable way to convert inspiration-led traffic
      into baskets (no funnel from image to add-to-cart).
    - >-
      Staff expertise is uneven; new associates struggle to match fabrics as
      well as veterans, impacting customer experience.
    - >-
      Multi-store and omnichannel retailers need real-time stock-aware matching
      to avoid recommending out-of-stock items.
  solution:
    - >-
      Embeddable widget and API: customers upload a photo and instantly see
      top-3/10 closest in-stock fabrics by color, pattern, and scale.
    - >-
      Real-time stock awareness: integrates with POS/e-commerce to exclude OOS
      items and show pickup/ship options.
    - >-
      Color palette extractor: auto-generates coordinating solids/tonals from
      the image to upsell supporting fabrics.
    - >-
      Fabric-aware embeddings: model trained/tuned on fabric swatches (quilting
      cotton, knits, batiks, home decor) for high-precision matching.
    - >-
      Staff console: override suggestions, flag alternatives, and approve
      curated sets for ‘shop-the-look’.
    - >-
      Catalog ingestion and normalization: bulk import supplier images, auto
      background removal, scale normalization, and color calibration options.
    - >-
      Analytics: measure upload→click→add-to-cart→purchase funnel, match
      acceptance rate, AOV uplift, and assisted revenue.
    - >-
      Kiosk and mobile SDK: in-store iPad/phone capture for walk-ins; QR handoff
      to customer’s device.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any inspiration photo into in-stock fabric recommendations in under a
    second, boosting conversion, basket size, and staff efficiency with a
    fabric-specific visual AI tuned for color, pattern, and scale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of fabric-specific training data and
    supplier-integrated catalogs (with calibrated color/scale) plus closed-loop
    feedback from thousands of real match decisions by shop staff—yielding
    materially higher match quality than general-purpose visual search. Early,
    certified integrations with the top POS/e-comm systems further reduce
    switching costs and create ecosystem lock-in.
  customerSegments:

    - 'Online-only fabric retailers (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce)'
    - Regional/national fabric and craft chains (store and e-commerce)
    - Home decor/upholstery fabric retailers

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Fabric shoppers—and the store associates helping them—who want to turn an
    inspiration photo into the closest in‑stock fabrics for sewing, quilting,
    and needlework.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual matching against thousands of SKUs is slow and error‑prone.
    Internal: Shoppers feel overwhelmed; associates guess. Philosophical:
    Finding the right fabric should be simple and delightful, not a scavenger
    hunt.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know how frustrating it is to match a photo to a bolt by eye.
    Authority: Our AI is tuned for textile color, pattern, texture, and scale,
    and connects to live inventory so recommendations are accurate and
    available.
  plan: >-
    3-step process: 1) Upload an inspiration photo (in‑store, associate device,
    or online). 2) View ranked in‑stock matches with color chips, scale
    previews, and coordinates. 3) Add to cart, request a cut, or see aisle/bin
    location. Agreements: Simple POS/e‑comm integration, no PII stored,
    transparent scoring, opt‑out anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and start a 14‑day pilot. Transitional: Try the sample
    matcher with demo data and review the integration guide.
  success: >-
    Customers quickly find fabrics that fit their vision; associates advise with
    confidence; higher conversion and basket size; faster inventory turns; a
    memorable, shareable shopping experience.
  failure: >-
    Customers give up or settle for mismatches; staff time is wasted; carts are
    abandoned; inventory stagnates; your store becomes a place to browse, not
    buy.
