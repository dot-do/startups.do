  problem:
    - >-
      Wireless carriers lose high-value subscribers due to late or mis-targeted
      retention outreach; existing churn models are batch, slow, and not
      connected to offer execution.
    - >-
      Retention offers are often non-compliant (TCPA/CTIA messaging rules, CPNI
      handling) or margin-erosive due to static discounting without guardrails.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling across CRM, BSS/OSS, and messaging vendors prevents
      closed-loop ROI measurement and rapid experimentation.
    - >-
      Marketing and care teams cannot prioritize save actions at the individual
      line level in near real time (port-out risk can change within hours).
    - >-
      Hard to quantify incremental impact; most carriers lack rigorous holdouts,
      causal lift measurement, and budget optimization for retention.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and unify telco data (billing/usage/CRM/network
      KPIs/tickets/port-out signals) via secure VPC connectors; identity
      resolution at subscriber/line level.
    - >-
      Real-time churn propensity scoring (sub-100ms per line API; updated at
      least hourly for batch feeds) with reason codes and explainability for
      agents.
    - >-
      Offer generator that enforces compliance and margin rules (CPNI/TCPA/CTIA
      templates, pricebook integration, discount caps, device balance logic).
    - >-
      Targeted outreach orchestration across SMS/email/in-app/care dialer with
      frequency caps and quiet hours; dynamic prioritization of save queues.
    - >-
      Causal measurement: persistent holdouts, uplift modeling, and budget
      optimization (multi-armed bandits) to maximize net revenue retained (NRR).
    - >-
      Dashboards for finance and retention teams: churn risk heatmaps, save-rate
      by segment/offer, LTV saved, CAC payback, and per-channel ROI.
    - >-
      Deployment options: carrier VPC or private cloud, with PII/CPNI
      minimization and on-database scoring where required.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce churn 8–15% relative within 90 days via real-time line-level risk
    scoring, compliant offer generation with margin guardrails, and closed-loop
    orchestration across SMS/email/care—measured by causal lift, not clicks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop stack purpose-built for telco: pretrained models on
    telecom-specific signals, an offer engine integrated with BSS pricebooks and
    margin guardrails, and causal ROI measurement with compliance-by-design
    (TCPA/CTIA/CPNI). Competitors typically offer either modeling or marketing
    execution, not both with real-time SLAs and auditable controls.
  customerSegments:
    - 'Tier-1 wireless carriers (10M+ subs; postpaid, prepaid, business lines).'
    - Tier-2/regional carriers (1–10M subs).

      Co-sell with cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure telecom vertical) via
      marketplace private offers and credits; leverage solution competency
      badges.

      Partnerships with BSS/OSS vendors (Amdocs/Netcracker/CSG) and SI partners
      (Accenture/Infosys/TCS) to embed connectors and accelerate procurement.

  character: >-
    Retention and marketing leaders at wireless carriers (NAICS 517112) who need
    to cut voluntary churn, protect ARPU/CLV, and prove ROI—without risking
    compliance or overloading operations.
  problem: >-
    Churn drivers hide in fragmented data; offers are manual and generic;
    outreach is mistimed; ROI is unclear; and every message risks TCPA/CTIA/FCC
    non-compliance—leaving teams reactive and revenue leaking.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of monthly churn targets under strict regulatory
    scrutiny. Built by telecom AI/CRM veterans, our platform is
    compliant-by-design with consent tracking, frequency caps, suppression
    lists, and audit trails.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely integrate billing/usage/CRM data and consent states. 2)
    Predict & Design: Calibrate churn models, segment cohorts, auto-generate
    compliant retention offers. 3) Orchestrate: Trigger targeted SMS/email
    journeys with A/B tests and throttling. 4) Prove: Track lift, ROI, and
    compliance in a live dashboard.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo or run a 6-week pilot on a limited segment to validate
    lift and compliance.
  success: >-
    Move from reactive saves to proactive retention: earlier, smarter outreach;
    measurable lift in saves and CLV; fewer unnecessary discounts; faster
    time-to-contact; audit-ready communications; and a clear, defensible ROI
    story for leadership.
  failure: >-
    Continued churn leakage, higher CAC to backfill losses, offer fatigue from
    generic blasts, compliance exposure, and no credible proof that retention
    spend is working.
