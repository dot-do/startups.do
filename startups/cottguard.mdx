  problem:
    - >-
      Cotton growers face 10–30% seasonal yield losses from bollworm, whitefly,
      aphids, and foliar diseases; timing of interventions is critical but
      difficult without localized risk forecasts.
    - >-
      Scouting is labor-intensive and inconsistent; many farms under- or
      over-scout, leading to delayed sprays or unnecessary applications that
      raise costs and resistance risk.
    - >-
      Existing advisories are generic (district-level) and not tied to action
      thresholds, leading to low trust and poor adherence.
    - >-
      Data for decision-making (weather, degree-days, trap counts, field images)
      is fragmented across apps, notebooks, and devices, making it hard to
      translate into actionable field-level decisions.
    - >-
      Smallholders often lack agronomic support, while large operations struggle
      to standardize pest-risk protocols across fields and geographies.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven risk scoring (0–100) for bollworm complex, whitefly, aphids, and
      key foliar diseases, updated daily with 7–14 day horizon.
    - >-
      Localized IPM thresholds baked into alerts (e.g., moths/trap/night,
      nymphs/leaf, percent plant infestation), adjusted by crop stage and
      cultivar.
    - >-
      Multi-source data fusion: hyperlocal weather/degree-days, pheromone trap
      counts (manual or smart traps), satellite indices (NDVI/EVI), and
      on-device image recognition from leaf/bug photos.
    - >-
      Actionable playbooks: scouting tasks and spray/biocontrol rotations mapped
      to resistance guidelines (IRAC/FRAC), with cost calculators and
      pre-harvest interval checks.
    - >-
      Low-connectivity delivery via SMS/WhatsApp/IVR in local languages plus a
      mobile app/API for enterprises.
    - >-
      Traceable, auditable records for advisors, retailers, and insurers (who
      saw which alert, when, and what action was taken).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-level, 7–14 day pest and disease risk forecasts that convert weather,
    degree-days, trap counts, and smartphone photos into action-threshold alerts
    and precise, label-compliant recommendations—reducing unnecessary sprays by
    1–2 per season and curbing 2–5% yield loss, with measurable ROI within one
    season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, cross-geo dataset linking trap dynamics,
    degree-days, and image-confirmed field symptoms to realized outcomes—plus
    localized, regulator-aligned action thresholds embedded in workflows.
    Combined with multi-channel low-connectivity delivery (WhatsApp/SMS/IVR) and
    OEM trap integrations, this creates high switching costs and superior model
    performance over generic advisories.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cotton growers and agronomists who want to protect yield, hit action
    thresholds, and spray only when needed.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable bollworm, whitefly, aphids, and foliar diseases—plus scattered
    weather, trap, and scouting data—create missed windows, wasted inputs, and
    yield loss. Farmers shouldn’t have to guess when pressure will spike.
  guide: >-
    We’re agronomy + AI specialists who understand field reality. Our models
    fuse weather, degree-days, trap counts, and photo diagnostics to predict
    risk and thresholds—validated with real farm data and built to fit existing
    workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect fields: location, variety, planting date; link traps/photos;
    optional station or API weather.

    2) Receive daily risk scores and clear action thresholds per field, with
    timing windows and spray/readiness checklists.

    3) Act and review: log actions, capture outcomes; the model learns and
    refines recommendations for your fields.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot on your top fields. Transitional: Get a sample
    risk report and benchmark your current program.
  success: >-
    Hit pests at threshold, reduce unnecessary sprays, protect lint yield and
    fiber quality, lower resistance pressure, and plan labor and inputs with
    confidence.
  failure: >-
    Spray too early or too late, trigger flare‑ups and secondary outbreaks,
    overspend on chemicals, lose yield and credibility, and stay stuck reacting
    to surprises.
