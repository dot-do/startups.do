leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High cost and variability of FNOL intake: 12–20 minutes average handle
      time, $8–$18 cost per call/chat, spikes 3–10x during CAT events causing
      long wait times and SLA breaches.
    - >-
      Suboptimal triage and routing at FNOL: 65–75% correct severity/assignment
      on first pass leads to rework, cycle time delays, leakage, and customer
      frustration.
    - >-
      Inaccurate early reserves: Initial reserves often deviate >30% from
      ultimate for a large subset of claims, distorting financials and
      regulatory reporting.
    - >-
      Fragmented data capture: Inconsistent or incomplete intake data forces
      callbacks, manual corrections, and slows straight-through processing
      (STP).
    - >-
      Limited digital reach: Many carriers have partial self-service FNOL.
      Omnichannel coverage (voice, chat, SMS, web, mobile) with seamless human
      handoff is missing or brittle.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit overhead: Call recording consent, GLBA, 23 NYCRR 500,
      model governance, multilingual accessibility, and documentation/audit
      trails are difficult to maintain at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational FNOL intake (voice/chat/SMS/web) with dynamic decisioning
      to capture required facts, geolocation, loss details, and evidence links.
    - >-
      Real-time coverage validation via policy system APIs and third-party data
      (date/time of loss, peril mapping, policy in-force, deductibles, limits).
    - >-
      AI-driven severity triage and assignment: score claim complexity, fraud
      risk signal, and recommend express/standard/complex/SIU routing and
      adjuster skill match.
    - >-
      Reserve recommendation at FNOL with explainability: confidence intervals,
      feature contributions, and guardrails aligned with carrier reserving
      policy.
    - >-
      Straight-through claim creation in core platforms (Guidewire, Duck Creek,
      Origami, ClaimsCore) including notes, tags, loss cause coding, and initial
      tasks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop escalation with full context transfer to an adjuster or
      CSR; supervisor console to review/override triage or reserves.
    - >-
      Document and media capture links (photo/video), telematics ingestion
      (where available), and automated verification prompts to improve
      completeness.
    - >-
      CAT surge handling with autoscaling, multi-language support (EN/ES at
      launch; expandable), and configurable compliance controls (consent, PII
      redaction, retention).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A turnkey, compliant AI FNOL intake and triage service that reduces intake
    costs 30–50%, improves routing accuracy to 85–92%, and delivers explainable
    reserve recommendations at FNOL—integrated with core claim systems to create
    claims, set recommended reserves, and assign to the right queue or adjuster
    in seconds.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned FNOL datasets and prebuilt integrations for major core systems
    and CCaaS platforms, plus explainable reserve models aligned to common
    carrier reserving policies. Early compliance approvals and procurement wins
    with Tier 1 carriers create data network effects and switching costs that
    generic contact-center AIs lack.
