  problem:
    - >-
      Independent and small-chain gas station C-stores lack time, tools, and
      expertise to run targeted promotions; most rely on generic discounts with
      low ROI.
    - >-
      Slow-moving SKUs, short-dated items, and seasonal overstock create shrink
      and tie up working capital; operators need automated clearance without
      eroding margin.
    - >-
      Existing loyalty platforms are expensive, complex to integrate, and rarely
      optimize at SKU level; generic SMS tools don’t connect to POS for
      closed-loop redemption and ROI.
    - >-
      Regulatory and carrier-compliance (TCPA, opt-in, quiet hours, SHAFT
      filtering) are barriers to scaling SMS; operators need compliant, turnkey
      flows.
    - >-
      Operators can’t reliably measure incremental lift; they need test/control
      measurement to justify ongoing budget.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play POS connectors ingest SKU-level sales, margin, inventory
      velocity, and expiration data daily.
    - >-
      AI offer engine detects slow movers and bundles complementary items; sets
      discount ceilings by gross margin and price elasticity; targets audiences
      by RFM, daypart, fuel vs. store visits, and product affinities.
    - >-
      Omnichannel orchestration for SMS/email with quiet-hours, throttle,
      weather/event triggers; auto A/B testing; single-use barcodes/PLUs for POS
      redemption.
    - >-
      Compliance toolkit: double opt-in flows via QR at pump, receipt QR,
      website sign-up, POS keypad capture; list hygiene and opt-out automation.
    - >-
      Closed-loop measurement with holdout groups and geo-controls to quantify
      incremental revenue and gross profit lift.
    - >-
      Manager dashboard: approve/override offers, set clearance windows, review
      store and SKU performance; corporate dashboard for multi-store KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase in-store revenue 5–10% in 60 days with fully automated,
    TCPA-compliant SMS/email campaigns that grow basket size by $1.00–$1.75 and
    cut slow-mover shrink 20–40%, proven by closed-loop POS redemption and
    test/control measurement.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt POS/loyalty connectors and a SKU-level model tuned for c-store
    categories enable week-one impact; closed-loop POS redemption with built-in
    holdouts proves incrementality; compliant opt-in capture at pump/receipt
    accelerates list growth; and a library of c-store–specific playbooks
    shortens time-to-value. Network learnings across stores continuously
    optimize offers while preserving each merchant’s data privacy.

      SMS sends/month): Revenue $299 SaaS + ~$15 margin on messaging = ~$314;
      COGS messaging ~$90, cloud $20, support $40 → gross margin ~52–60% before
      S&M; target >70% at scale via email mix and smarter throttling.

  character: >-
    Gas station + convenience store operators who want to grow basket size,
    clear slow movers, and keep loyalty members engaged—without a marketing
    team.
  problem: >-
    Manual, generic promos waste time and margin: slow movers linger, blasts get
    ignored, and guesswork targeting leads to low lift and opt-outs. It
    shouldn’t be hard to send the right offer to the right customer at the right
    moment.
  guide: >-
    Loyalty & Promotion Campaign Generator—AI built for fuel and C-store retail.
    We combine your POS, inventory, and loyalty data to auto-create targeted
    SMS/email offers with retail-savvy rules, compliance, and proof of
    performance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect POS/loyalty/inventory. 2) Pick a goal (increase basket, clear
    SKUs, drive dayparts/attachments). 3) Review and approve—then we launch, A/B
    test, and optimize; you track uplift and ROI in a simple dashboard.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a 14-day pilot and send your first campaign in 24 hours.
    Secondary: Book a 20-minute demo or download sample campaigns + ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Measurable basket lift and attachment rates (fuel+carwash, coffee+pastry),
    faster turns on slow movers, fewer markdowns, steadier daypart traffic, more
    loyal members, vendor-funded promos, and marketing on autopilot.
  failure: >-
    Stock ties up cash, blanket discounts erode margin, members tune out, weekly
    promo work never ends, compliance risks grow, and competitors win your
    customers.
