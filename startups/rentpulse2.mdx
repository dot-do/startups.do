  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned equipment downtime erodes rental utilization and customer
      satisfaction; PMs are missed or done late because service intervals don’t
      align with actual rental hours or contract dates.
    - >-
      Dispatchers juggle telematics portals, rental systems, and spreadsheets;
      work orders are opened too late and swaps are reactive, causing lost
      rental days.
    - >-
      Branch teams lack forward visibility (next 7–30 days) of service-due units
      by location/jobsite, leading to emergency field calls and inefficient
      technician routing.
    - >-
      OEM telematics data is fragmented across multiple platforms and formats;
      maintenance schedules vary by asset class/OEM and are hard to normalize.
    - >-
      Existing CMMS/RMS maintenance modules are not “rental-aware” (don’t factor
      contract end dates, subrentals, swaps) and lack predictive scheduling.
    - >-
      Field technicians suffer low first-time fix rates due to missing
      parts/notes; parts aren’t pre-picked because service isn’t forecasted
      precisely.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest telematics (hours, location, fault codes) and rental system data
      (contract dates, availability, branch) to predict PM due windows 7–30 days
      ahead by asset.
    - >-
      Auto-generate work orders in the customer’s RMS/CMMS with priority,
      jobsite, and required parts based on OEM service schedules and usage
      patterns.
    - >-
      Swap planning assistant that recommends the best timing and replacement
      unit to avoid rental disruption; triggers customer notifications and
      logistics tasks.
    - >-
      Technician scheduling optimizer that sequences PMs by route, SLA, and
      parts availability; mobile app pushes work orders and captures
      proof-of-service.
    - >-
      Exception dashboards that surface high-risk assets (overdue PM, high fault
      frequency, high-value jobsites) and quantify revenue-at-risk.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics: track on-time PM%, unplanned events, swap
      avoidance, utilization uplift, technician productivity, and cost per hour
      served.
    - >-
      APIs and prebuilt connectors for major telematics/OEM portals and rental
      management systems to eliminate swivel-chair workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, rental-aware predictive maintenance and service ticketing that
    aligns PM windows with real rental hours and contract dates, automatically
    opens and routes work orders, and coordinates proactive swaps—cutting
    unplanned downtime and boosting utilization without disrupting rentals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rental-aware prediction and workflow automation built on cross-OEM,
    cross-RMS data plus an expanding dataset of rental duty cycles and outcomes;
    deep integrations that auto-open and route work orders and orchestrate swaps
    tied to contract dates—difficult for generic CMMS or single-OEM tools to
    replicate.
