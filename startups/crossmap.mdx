leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier catalogs arrive in inconsistent formats (PDF, Excel, EDI, CSV,
      email attachments) with variable schemas, units, and attribute
      naming—making normalization slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Agents/brokers lose deals due to slow quote turnaround and inability to
      quickly propose equivalent/substitute SKUs when preferred brands are out
      of stock or overpriced.
    - >-
      Manual cross-reference tables are incomplete, quickly stale, and require
      tribal knowledge; scaling them across 100K–5M SKUs is impractical.
    - >-
      Existing PIM/MDM systems do not solve automated normalization or
      equivalence mapping; they depend on manual mapping and brand-provided
      data, which varies in quality.
    - >-
      Duplicate and near-duplicate items inflate catalogs, cause pricing
      inconsistencies, and increase return rates and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Frequent supplier updates (new SKUs, spec changes, discontinued items) are
      hard to detect and propagate, creating compliance and quality issues.
    - >-
      Brokers need integrations with ERPs/PIMs/CRMs and a clear audit trail to
      satisfy customers, manufacturers, and internal QA teams.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion and parsing of supplier catalogs across PDF, Excel,
      CSV, EDI, and portals; multilingual OCR and table extraction.
    - >-
      Attribute extraction and normalization using domain-tuned NLP/ML (UoM,
      pack size, material, voltage, dimensions, certifications, hazardous
      flags).
    - >-
      Taxonomy mapping to industry standards (UNSPSC, eCl@ss, ETIM) and support
      for custom schemas.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and deduplication to unify near-duplicates and alias
      SKUs across suppliers/brands.
    - >-
      Cross-reference engine that uses multimodal similarity (text/specs,
      images, metadata) plus rules to identify equivalents, substitutes, and
      compatibles; confidence scoring with human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      Change detection and incremental updates to keep catalogs fresh (new,
      changed, discontinued items) with delta exports and notifications.
    - >-
      Reviewer console for QA, bulk actions, exception handling, and audit
      trails; configurable confidence thresholds by category.
    - >-
      APIs, flat-file exports, and prebuilt connectors to NetSuite, SAP B1,
      Acumatica, Salsify, Akeneo, BigCommerce B2B, and custom ERPs.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SSO/SAML, role-based access, data isolation by
      tenant, SOC 2 roadmap, PII minimization.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 2–6 week pilot, success criteria defined upfront
      (precision/recall, automation rate, time-to-quote).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy supplier catalogs into a clean, comparable product master with
    verified cross-references in days, not months—cut quote turnaround by 50%,
    boost win rates 5–10%, and reduce catalog maintenance cost by 30–50%, with
    full auditability and ERP/PIM integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, privacy-preserving cross-reference graph built from
    anonymized patterns across customers—paired with vertical-specific
    embeddings and rule libraries. This yields higher-precision equivalence
    detection than general-purpose PIM/MDM tools. Prebuilt ERP/PIM connectors
    and a curated gold-standard dataset shorten implementation from months to
    weeks, and a pilot-first playbook proves ROI quickly.
