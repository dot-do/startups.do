  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned conveyor downtime causes production and fulfillment losses of
      $10k–$200k per hour in parcel, e‑commerce, F&B, airports, and mining, yet
      most sites still rely on reactive maintenance and periodic rounds.
    - >-
      PLC alarms and threshold rules generate noise but miss early-stage
      bearing, gearbox, and motor defects; existing condition-monitoring tools
      are often generic and not tuned to conveyor duty cycles or failure modes.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (PLC, VFDs, SCADA, CMMS/EAM); no automated linkage between
      asset risk and prioritized work orders, so critical issues are lost in
      maintenance backlogs.
    - >-
      Mixed fleets across OEMs and integrators lack a unified predictive layer;
      multi-OEM support and cross-site benchmarking are limited.
    - >-
      Spare parts management is suboptimal; without accurate failure risk and
      remaining useful life (RUL), planners can’t pre-stage critical gearmotors,
      bearings, or reducers, leading to premium freight and rush orders.
    - >-
      Operators lack measurable ROI from prior IoT projects due to long
      time-to-value, integration friction, and insufficient operational
      adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge and cloud analytics that fuse PLC tags, VFD data, and low-cost
      vibration/temperature/current sensors to detect early-stage bearing,
      gearbox, and motor issues.
    - >-
      Physics-informed and data-driven models tailored to conveyor duty cycles
      that estimate remaining useful life and failure risk by asset, zone, and
      line.
    - >-
      Automated, prioritized work orders pushed to CMMS/EAM with recommended
      fix, spares, and estimated downtime impact; supports SAP PM, IBM Maximo,
      Infor EAM, eMaint, Fiix, Limble, UpKeep.
    - >-
      Cross-OEM asset models and a conveyor-specific failure mode library (FMEA)
      for rollers, MDRs, gearmotors, pulleys, take-up assemblies, and idlers.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard quantifying avoided downtime, labor hours saved, and
      parts/expedite cost avoided; site and enterprise roll-ups.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment via prebuilt PLC/VFD connectors (Rockwell, Siemens,
      Schneider, Beckhoff) and optional retrofit sensor kits for legacy lines.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned conveyor downtime by 30–50% and maintenance costs by 15–25%
    within 90 days by turning PLC and low-cost sensor data into prioritized,
    auto-generated work orders with accurate RUL and parts recommendations
    across multi-OEM fleets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A conveyor-specific FMEA library and labeled dataset collected through OEM
    partnerships and multi-site deployments, enabling high-precision early fault
    detection with low-cost sensors and PLC signals; prebuilt multi-OEM
    connectors and CMMS integrations shrink time-to-value to under 30 days,
    creating switching costs via embedded workflows and demonstrated ROI.
