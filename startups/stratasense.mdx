  problem:
    - >-
      Underground coal workers face chronic overexposure to respirable dust and
      silica, driving coal workers’ pneumoconiosis and silicosis rates;
      real-time alerting and root-cause analysis are limited in most operations.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: operators struggle to continuously demonstrate adherence
      to exposure limits (e.g., respirable coal dust ~1.5 mg/m³ TWA; respirable
      crystalline silica ~50 µg/m³ TWA), resulting in citations, production
      interruptions, and reputational damage.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: fixed monitors, personal dust monitors (CPDMs/PDMs),
      ventilation telemetry, and maintenance logs live in silos, preventing
      timely, actionable insights.
    - >-
      Reactive controls: crews often learn of exceedances post-shift; few sites
      translate readings into targeted controls (e.g., spray nozzle replacement,
      scrubber adjustments, ventilation changes, or rotation) during shift.
    - >-
      Maintenance gaps: spray/ scrubber performance degrades between
      inspections; lack of predictive maintenance leads to spikes in dust and
      unnecessary downtime.
    - >-
      Workforce scheduling is manual and doesn’t account for cumulative
      exposure, medical restrictions, or skill constraints, increasing
      exceedance risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time data from personal dust monitors (CPDM/PDM), fixed area
      sensors, equipment telemetry (shearer/CM, scrubbers, conveyors), and
      ventilation systems.
    - >-
      Generate per-worker, per-location exposure curves and cumulative dose
      forecasts; predict exceedance risk 15–60 minutes ahead with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Issue prescriptive recommendations: adjust ventilation settings, increase
      scrubber speed, activate/aim sprays, slow cutting rate, reposition
      personnel, or rotate workers with compatible skills.
    - >-
      Automate maintenance: detect degrading spray patterns/flow from telemetry,
      prioritize nozzle replacements, filter changes, and scrubber media
      maintenance; create work orders.
    - >-
      Provide compliance-ready reports (daily/weekly/monthly) mapping exposure
      vs. limits by worker, crew, and section with auditable actions taken.
    - >-
      Offer a scheduling assistant that proposes rotations minimizing cumulative
      exposure while respecting skills, certifications, union rules, fatigue
      limits, and production targets.
    - >-
      Deliver mine-map heatmaps and “what-if” simulators to compare control
      options’ projected impact (e.g., mg/m³ reduction, time to
      below-threshold).
    - >-
      Operate in low-connectivity environments with edge gateways; sync to cloud
      when available; support bilingual alerts and role-based dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Close the loop from detection to action: a real-time AI platform that
    predicts dust hotspots, recommends specific controls and worker rotations,
    and verifies effectiveness—reducing exceedances, avoiding citations, and
    protecting miners’ health.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A prescriptive control engine trained on multi-source mining data (personal
    and fixed dust readings + equipment/ventilation telemetry) that not only
    detects risk but recommends validated, equipment-specific actions and
    verifies their effect in minutes—combined with a rotation optimizer that
    respects mining skill constraints and labor rules.
