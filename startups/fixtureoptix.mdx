  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers carry 10,000–250,000 SKUs across variants (CCT, lumen
      packages, optics, mounting, voltage), creating 20–40% long-tail items with
      <5 units sold per year that inflate COGS and working capital.
    - >-
      Duplicate and near-duplicate SKUs (8–15% typical) inflate materials
      diversity, tooling, supplier count, ECO volume, and certification costs
      with little incremental revenue.
    - >-
      Engineering and sourcing lack a systematized way to propose compliant
      alternates (UL/DLC/Title 24), resulting in slow, manual evaluations and
      missed cost-down opportunities.
    - >-
      Fragmented ERP/PLM data (SAP/Oracle/Infor/Epicor/Plex + spreadsheets)
      makes it hard to cluster SKUs by performance and attributes across plants
      and brands.
    - >-
      Component proliferation (LED drivers, boards, heat sinks, lenses,
      housings, fasteners) increases MOQ exposure, long lead times, and
      obsolescence risk.
    - >-
      Price pressure from large distributors/contractors and design-build firms
      squeezes margins; OEMs need standardized, lower-cost configurations
      without sacrificing compliance or performance.
    - >-
      M&A and private-label lines create overlapping portfolios with redundant
      SKUs and certifications that are expensive to maintain.
    - >-
      Sales engineering spends cycles configuring edge-case SKUs that could be
      steered to standard platforms if guided by data-driven alternatives.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and normalization from ERP/PLM/PIM, test reports
      (LM-79/80), BOMs, and spec sheets to create a unified SKU-attribute graph.
    - >-
      AI clustering of SKUs by performance and form factor (e.g., lumen output,
      efficacy, CCT, optics, driver type, enclosure rating, mounting, voltage)
      to detect duplicates and near-duplicates.
    - >-
      Tail analysis to identify low-volume, high-complexity SKUs and quantify
      impact on inventory, tooling, ECO load, and supplier count.
    - >-
      Alternate proposal engine that suggests platform SKUs or BOM substitutions
      (drivers, LEDs, optics, hardware) with modeled cost, lead time, and
      performance deltas.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails that preserve UL 1598/8750, DLC listing equivalency,
      FCC Part 15, and regional codes (e.g., Title 24 JA8) during consolidation
      or substitution.
    - >-
      Savings model and business case generator that simulates SKU and component
      consolidation effects on COGS, MOQ, safety stock, and working capital.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations (SAP/Oracle/Infor/Epicor,
      Arena/Agile/Teamcenter/Windchill) to route approved changes into ECOs and
      supplier RFQs.
    - >-
      Change steering for sales engineering: suggest standard, pre-approved
      alternates during quoting to avoid new custom SKUs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce SKUs by 15–30% and COGS by 3–8% in 90–180 days with lighting-specific
    AI that clusters SKUs by performance/attributes, flags duplicates and
    low-volume tails, and proposes compliant, cost-down alternates with
    quantified impact on margin, inventory, and lead time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A lighting-specific component-substitution and compliance rules graph
    trained on multi-client BOM patterns and testing data, enabling compliant
    cost-down recommendations (not just deduping). Combined with prebuilt
    ERP/PLM connectors and validated case studies delivering 15–30% SKU
    reduction and 3–8% COGS savings, this creates a defensible data and process
    moat.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Product, engineering, and supply chain leaders at commercial, industrial,
    and institutional lighting manufacturers (NAICS 335132) who want a tighter,
    more profitable portfolio without risking spec compliance or sales coverage.
  problem: >-
    - External: Bloated, overlapping SKU catalogs, duplicate BOMs, low-volume
    tails, and component proliferation drive COGS up and lead times out.

    - Internal: Teams waste hours chasing equivalents and maintaining variants;
    sales struggles to quote fast with confidence.

    - Philosophical: Spec-grade lighting shouldn’t require guesswork to
    standardize and save.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect spec coverage while improving margin.
    Our AI is trained on lighting-specific attributes (lumen package, CCT, CRI,
    optics, drivers, thermal, form factor) to cluster SKUs by performance, flag
    duplicates, and surface cost-down alternates. We speak your language (IES
    files, DLC listings, BOM hierarchies) and keep your data secure.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest: Securely unify SKU masters, BOMs, attributes, IES/photometrics,
    costs, and sales history.

    2) Analyze: Cluster by performance/attributes; detect duplicates and
    near-equivalents; quantify tail and component sprawl.

    3) Recommend: Propose consolidation sets, platform standards, and cost-down
    alternates with margin, lead-time, and revenue-risk impact.

    4) Act: Pilot on a family, approve in workflow, update ERP/PLM, and scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a 30-minute portfolio assessment. Transitional: Upload a
    sample SKU list for a free duplication and tail scorecard.
  success: |-
    - Leaner portfolio with fewer SKUs and standardized platforms.
    - Lower COGS via component consolidation and cost-down alternates.
    - Faster quoting and engineering response with clear sales guidance.
    - Shorter lead times, better inventory turns, reduced supply risk.
    - Maintained spec compliance and customer choice.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing SKU sprawl erodes margins and slows quotes.
    - Working capital trapped in low-volume tails and redundant parts.
    - Duplicated engineering effort and supplier complexity persist.
    - Lost bids from long lead times and inconsistent spec coverage.
