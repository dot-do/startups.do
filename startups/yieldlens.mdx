leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic yield loss (2–8% of output) from multivariate, time‑lagged defects
      (e.g., coating streaks, mottle, haze, fog, caliper variability,
      gel/particle counts, plate sensitivity drift, toner PSD out‑of‑spec) is
      hard to diagnose with SPC alone.
    - >-
      Mean time to root‑cause (MTTRC) for new or intermittent defects is often
      2–6 weeks; during this period scrap, rework, and missed shipments
      accumulate.
    - >-
      Historian data (PI/PHD/IP.21/Exaquantum) is abundant but poorly
      contextualized to batches/lots/rolls; manual alignment to ISA‑88 phases
      and LIMS/MES/QMS data is time‑consuming.
    - >-
      Traditional tools (trend charts, pairwise correlations, Minitab/JMP)
      struggle with high‑dimensional interactions, non‑linearities, and time
      offsets; they often surface spurious correlations and yield un-actionable
      insights.
    - >-
      Actionability gap: existing analytics flag anomalies but rarely produce
      SOP‑ready corrective actions with predicted impact/risks and MOC/approval
      routing.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge risk: retirement/turnover erodes hard‑won know‑how;
      lessons aren’t systematically captured for reuse across shifts and sites.
    - >-
      IT/OT constraints: air‑gapped or regulated environments need on‑prem/VPC
      options, auditability, and explainability for quality and customer audits.
    - >-
      Data silos: historian, MES (batches/recipes), LIMS (lab results), and
      CMMS/QMS (deviations) are not integrated, delaying detection and learning.
    - >-
      Experimentation is risky/slow; plants need safe what‑if simulation before
      changing setpoints/recipes on live product.
    - >-
      Limited in‑house data science bandwidth causes PoCs to stall before value
      realization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rapid, secure connection to historian (PI, PHD, IP.21, Exaquantum,
      Wonderware, Siemens) and context sources (MES/ISA‑88 batches, LIMS, QMS).
    - >-
      Automated contextualization: create event frames for batches/rolls/coating
      passes; align lab results; compute phase‑level features, delays, and
      aggregations.
    - >-
      Multivariate discovery: feature selection with lag handling, non‑linear
      modeling, and confounder control; rank true drivers using causal inference
      and SHAP explanations.
    - >-
      Golden batch/recipe window learning: derive target trajectories and
      acceptable envelopes per product/grade/recipe; drift detection before
      defects occur.
    - >-
      Prescriptions: translate drivers into operator/engineer actions (setpoint
      adjustments, phase timing tweaks, filter/strainer change intervals,
      raw‑material lot quarantines) with predicted impact, confidence intervals,
      and guardrails.
    - >-
      What‑if simulator: counterfactuals to estimate yield/quality changes from
      proposed levers; A/B trial design with safe production constraints.
    - >-
      Operationalization: real‑time monitors and watchlists for top drivers;
      alerts routed to DCS consoles/CMMS/QMS with audit trail and MOC approval
      flow.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: capture outcomes of actions and update driver
      rankings; build a cross‑site knowledge base of defect modes and fixes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut scrap 3–10% and reduce time‑to‑root‑cause by 80% within 90 days by
    turning historian + batch/quality data into explainable causal drivers and
    SOP‑ready corrective actions—purpose‑built for coated media, plates,
    chemical emulsions, and toner lines.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain‑specific prescriptive analytics for imaging/coating and toner: a
    growing proprietary knowledge base linking common defect modes to validated
    levers, combined with pre‑built historian/MES/LIMS integrations and
    explainable causal/prescriptive models—enabling actionable, auditable
    recommendations in weeks rather than months and a repeatable playbook for
    multi‑site rollouts.
