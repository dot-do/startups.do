  problem:
    - >-
      Manual tracking of supplier certifications (FSMA/GFSI, Organic, fair-trade
      schemes) across thousands of suppliers leads to missed expirations and
      shipment holds.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity (FSMA FSVP, EUDR due diligence, USDA NOP) changes
      frequently; teams lack a single source of truth and miss updates.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into multi-tier supply chains (farms, cooperatives,
      brokers) makes it hard to verify geolocations and deforestation risk for
      EUDR.
    - >-
      Audit preparation is expensive and slow (weeks), with scattered evidence
      across email, spreadsheets, and portals.
    - >-
      Inability to identify and act on adverse media, sanctions, or enforcement
      actions in near real-time exposes firms to compliance, brand, and
      counterparty risk.
    - >-
      Supplier onboarding and re-qualification are inconsistent; data capture
      (geolocations, scope of certifications) is incomplete or wrong.
    - >-
      Remediation tasks are assigned ad hoc, with no SLAs, owners, or
      traceability—failing CAPA expectations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified supplier compliance graph: central repository of suppliers,
      facilities, certifications, geolocations, risk scores, and evidence.
    - >-
      Automated certificate capture and validation: OCR + issuer registry checks
      (e.g., BRCGS, SQF, USDA NOP Integrity Database), with proactive renewal
      alerts (30/60/90 days).
    - >-
      EUDR module: capture plot/farm geolocations/polygons; screen against
      deforestation alerts (e.g., GLAD/RADD) and protected areas; generate due
      diligence statements with risk grading and evidence bundles.
    - >-
      Organic integrity module: cross-check organic certificates, scope,
      suspensions/withdrawals; ingest transaction certificates and match to
      shipments/lots.
    - >-
      Regulatory change monitor: summarize FDA/FSMA, EU EUDR guidance, USDA NOP
      notices; map changes to internal controls and affected suppliers.
    - >-
      Adverse media and sanctions screening: daily scanning for human rights,
      child labor, environmental violations, OFAC/UFLPA/Entity Lists; auto-open
      investigations.
    - >-
      Workflow and CAPA: assign owners, SLAs, checklists; email/Slack/Teams
      notifications; audit-ready trails and dashboards; integrations with
      ERP/GRC (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-on AI that validates supplier certifications, predicts expirations,
    screens for EUDR deforestation risk using geospatial intelligence, and
    routes remediation tasks—cutting audit prep by 50%+, preventing shipment
    blocks, and keeping you ahead of regulatory change.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously updated supplier–certificate knowledge graph and
    renewal prediction model specific to agri raw materials, combined with
    built-in EUDR geospatial due diligence and direct issuer
    validations—reducing false positives and time-to-evidence compared to
    generic GRC or SRM tools. Network effects strengthen as more suppliers and
    certificates flow through the platform.
