leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent personal/corporate names and subject headings across legacy
      MARC/EAD/DC records lead to duplicate authors, split works, and poor
      discovery (typical 5–15% duplicate/variant rate in medium-sized catalogs).
    - >-
      Manual authority work is slow and costly (0.5–2 minutes per record for
      review/updates), creating persistent backlogs and QA risk.
    - >-
      Batch vendor services are episodic; changes quickly drift as new records
      are ingested, leading to rework and recurring costs.
    - >-
      High risk of damaging data integrity during large-scale cleanups; most
      ILS/LSPs lack robust ‘dry run + rollback’ for authority-driven updates.
    - >-
      Multilingual/transliteration and homonym handling are weak in current
      pipelines, especially for non-Latin scripts and local variants.
    - >-
      Limited cross-system reconciliation across ILS + archival systems (e.g.,
      Alma/Koha/WMS with ArchivesSpace), causing divergent authorities and
      duplicate entities.
    - >-
      Policy-driven subject updates (e.g., LCSH changes, DEI remediation) are
      difficult to propagate safely and consistently across large sets of
      records.
  solution:
    - >-
      Entity resolution engine that reconciles personal/corporate names and
      subjects against LCNAF, VIAF, ISNI, ORCID, FAST, and Wikidata with
      librarian-in-the-loop review workflows.
    - >-
      Generate ‘safe change sets’ tailored to each platform (e.g., Alma Job XML
      + API payloads; Koha bulkmarcimport batches; Sierra REST Rapid Update;
      FOLIO Okapi inventory updates; ArchivesSpace JSON API updates), with
      automatic rollback scripts and audit logs.
    - >-
      Risk scoring + explainability for every proposed merge/change (e.g.,
      confidence scores, matched identifiers, evidence fields,
      language/script/transliteration cues).
    - >-
      Incremental monitoring: watch new/changed bib/authority records (via
      APIs/OAI-PMH/SFTP) and continuously reconcile, so catalogs don’t drift
      between periodic vendor runs.
    - >-
      Policy packs for subject updates (e.g., implement controlled vocab updates
      and local DEI policies) with simulation (“dry run”) and impact analysis
      before applying.
    - >-
      Multilingual/transliteration handling (ALA-LC; common mappings) and
      cross-record context (co-authors, publishers, series, dates) to reduce
      false merges of homonyms.
    - >-
      Cross-system linking: keep ILS and ArchivesSpace aligned by pushing
      consistent authority URIs and local headings across both environments.
    - >-
      Comprehensive QA dashboards: acceptance queues, false-positive feedback
      loop, time saved, backlog burn-down, precision/recall by record
      type/collection.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, explainable authority control and disambiguation that produces
    audited, reversible change sets for your ILS/LSP and archives—reducing
