  problem:
    - >-
      Wire drawing plants rely on manual coolant checks (Brix, pH, conductivity)
      1–2 times/shift; concentration drift of ±2–3 Brix commonly increases draw
      force by 5–12% and raises wire break risk.
    - >-
      Unplanned coolant dumps due to contamination, bacteria, or fines cause
      8–24 hours of downtime per tank and $10k–$50k/event in lost production,
      labor, and waste disposal.
    - >-
      Over‑ or under‑dosing concentrate/biocide/antifoam typically wastes 10–30%
      chemicals or accelerates die wear and surface defects (pits, scoring),
      increasing scrap by 0.5–2.0% of output.
    - >-
      Filtration/blindness and fines accumulation are not linked to process
      signals; suboptimal filter changes and centrifuge operation add 3–6%
      energy use and shorten bath life by 20–40%.
    - >-
      Energy intensity for wet drawing is 100–250 kWh/ton; poor emulsion health
      and friction conditions add 3–8% energy per ton, often unnoticed at the
      plant power meter level.
    - >-
      Quality escapes (surface finish, diameter variation) correlate with force
      spikes and temperature/emulsion instability but are detected late;
      root-cause analysis is manual and slow.
    - >-
      Data silos: PLC draw force/amp data, SCADA trends, lab logs, and
      maintenance notes are unconnected, preventing proactive actions and
      continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Environmental and compliance pressure: Excess chemical consumption and
      frequent dumps increase COD load and wastewater cost; many plants lack
      auditable coolant health records.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive sensor kit (inline refractometer, pH, conductivity,
      turbidity/particle load, temperature, optional bacteria) plus PLC/SCADA
      integrations to capture draw force, power, speed, die schedule, filter
      differential pressure.
    - >-
      Edge gateway fuses signals; cloud models learn causal links between
      emulsion health, draw force variance, break events, energy per ton, and
      defect tags.
    - >-
      Dosage Advisor: real-time recommendations for concentrate %, biocide,
      antifoam, and make-up water with confidence intervals and expected impact
      on force and quality.
    - >-
      Dump & Filtration Planner: predicts remaining bath life, schedules optimal
      dump/clean cycles, and recommends filter media change/centrifuge duty
      based on fines loading and energy penalties.
    - >-
      Closed-loop control (optional): integrates with dosing pumps/valves to
      auto-correct concentration and pH within guardrails; operator approval
      workflows as needed.
    - >-
      Quality & Energy Guardrails: alerts on force spikes vs baseline, predicted
      break probability, and energy per ton deviations; correlates to emulsion
      condition changes.
    - >-
      Compliance & Traceability: audit-ready logs of coolant parameters, actions
      taken, and outcomes; multi-plant benchmarking and API to MES/QMS/CMMS.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously optimize emulsion health to cut wire breaks 20–40%, reduce
    chemical use 10–30%, and lower energy 3–8% with AI that links coolant
    chemistry to draw force, defects, and kWh—then recommends or autonomously
    executes dosing, dump timing, and filtration actions. Typical payback: 1–3
    months per line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, wire-drawing-specific dataset and models that quantify causal
    links between emulsion health, draw force, defects, and energy, paired with
    autonomous dosing and filtration control integrations. Co-selling agreements
    with coolant suppliers/OEMs create distribution and data network effects
    that are hard to replicate.

  problem: >-
    Emulsion/coolant health drifts between checks, pushing up draw force,
