  problem:
    - >-
      High-friction pre-arrival tasks (waivers, rig dimensions, vehicle/license,
      pet forms) create phone/email backlogs for small teams, especially during
      peak check-in windows (3–7pm).
    - >-
      Manual distribution of gate/WiFi codes and site maps leads to errors,
      lineups at the office, and poor guest experience; late arrivals often
      trigger after-hours calls.
    - >-
      Upsell revenue (firewood, propane, golf carts, early check-in/late
      checkout, site upgrades) is inconsistent due to staff workload and lack of
      systematic offers and payments before arrival.
    - >-
      Existing PMS emails are generic, one-way, and have low completion rates
      for forms; two-way SMS, automated workflows, e-sign, and device
      integrations are limited or require heavy setup.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (TCPA/CTIA for SMS, waiver enforceability, PCI issues
      when taking payments) are poorly handled by DIY tools, creating liability.
    - >-
      Limited data on what messages/upsells work by segment (RVer type, rig
      length, arrival time) prevents optimization and benchmarking across
      properties.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated messaging engine triggers pre-arrival flows by reservation
      status, arrival date/time, rig type, and channel (SMS/email).
    - >-
      Mobile check-in link collects waivers (ESIGN/UETA-compliant), IDs, rig
      dimensions, extra vehicles/pets, and payment for balances/add-ons.
    - >-
      Dynamic access distribution: auto-provision gate and WiFi codes; share
      site map and directions optimized for large rigs and late arrivals.
    - >-
      Rules-based upsell offers (early check-in, late checkout, site upgrades,
      firewood, propane, golf carts, activities) with inventory-aware pricing
      and A/B testing.
    - >-
      Two-way guest messaging with AI-assisted replies for common questions,
      escalating to staff when needed.
    - >-
      Integrations with leading campground PMS, payment processors, gate
      controllers, and WiFi captive portals for end-to-end automation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate every step from booking to site arrival with two-way SMS, e-sign
    waivers, rig-fit validation, and one-click upsells—reducing front-desk
    workload by 30–50% while adding $4–$12 incremental revenue per reservation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep RV- and campground-specific automations (rig-fit validation, access
    provisioning, upsell playbooks) plus broad PMS/access/WiFi integrations and
    a template/benchmark dataset that rapidly improves outcomes across
    parks—difficult for generic hotel messaging tools or PMS-native emails to
    replicate.
