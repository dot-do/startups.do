leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Claims processing averages 7-14 days, causing customer frustration and operational inefficiency; manual reviews create bottlenecks that delay payouts and increase administrative costs by 25-40%"
    - "Fraud and leakage increase loss ratios by 10-15%, with traditional detection methods missing sophisticated fraud patterns; annual fraud losses exceed $40B industry-wide"
    - "Poor claimant experience leads to 23% customer churn post-claim; lack of real-time updates and transparency damages insurer reputation and Net Promoter Scores"
    - "Fragmented data across systems (FNOL, photos, police reports, repair estimates) requires manual correlation; adjusters spend 60% of time on data gathering vs. decision-making"
    - "Inconsistent claim decisions due to adjuster variability and workload pressure; lack of standardized risk scoring leads to overpayments and regulatory compliance issues"
    - "Limited scalability during catastrophic events; manual processes cannot handle claim volume spikes, leading to extended processing times and customer dissatisfaction"
  solution:
    - "End-to-end agentic workflow that automates FNOL intake through final payout in under 5 minutes for straightforward claims; AI orchestrates document collection, parsing, and decision-making"
    - "Advanced document parsing with OCR and NLP extraction of structured data from photos, PDFs, and forms; automated fraud risk scoring using proprietary ML models trained on claims patterns"
    - "Human-in-the-loop review system for edge cases and high-value claims; configurable approval thresholds and escalation workflows maintain accuracy while enabling automation"
    - "Real-time integration with insurer core systems, repair networks, and third-party data sources; unified dashboard provides complete claim visibility and audit trails"
    - "Standardized risk assessment and decision engine with explainable AI; consistent application of underwriting rules and regulatory compliance across all claims"
    - "Elastic cloud infrastructure that automatically scales during catastrophic events; API-first architecture enables rapid deployment and integration with existing systems"
  uniqueValueProp: "Minutes-to-payout with better accuracy: Deliver 5-minute claim resolution for 80% of auto claims while maintaining 99%+ accuracy through AI-human collaboration"
  unfairAdvantage: "Proprietary claims pattern database trained on 10M+ historical claims combined with deep insurer system integrations and human-in-the-loop validation that competitors cannot easily replicate"
