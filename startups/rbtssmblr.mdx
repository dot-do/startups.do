  problem:
    - >-
      PBMs and health plan TPAs lose 0.5–2.0% of eligible manufacturer rebate
      dollars to data quality issues, contract misinterpretation, and missed
      deadlines.
    - >-
      Rebate submission prep is labor-intensive (manual NDC crosswalks, contract
      lookups, de-duping reversals), causing 2–4 week cycle times and costly
      rework.
    - >-
      Contracts vary by segment (Commercial, Medicare Part D, Medicaid MCO),
      channel (retail, specialty, mail), and tiered utilization thresholds;
      rules are complex and frequently change.
    - >-
      Exception handling lacks root-cause analytics, leading to repeated errors
      and poor audit readiness.
    - >-
      Medical-benefit drug rebates (J-code to NDC mapping) are under-claimed or
      late due to fragmented data across TPAs and providers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest Rx and medical claims; normalize to consistent schema (e.g., NCPDP
      D.0 fields for pharmacy, ANSI 837/835 for medical), de-dup reversals, and
      validate completeness.
    - >-
      Auto-extract and codify contract terms via NLP and a rules engine: tiered
      rebates, channel/segment eligibility, formulary placement, inflation
      penalties, exclusions (e.g., 340B), accumulator/copay assistance rules.
    - >-
      Aggregate utilization at NDC11 and contract-defined period
      (monthly/quarterly), apply pricing references (WAC/AWP/NADAC) and
      thresholds, then compute expected rebate amounts.
    - >-
      Generate manufacturer-specific claim packages with required layouts,
      backup detail, attestations, and exception flags with root-cause codes.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: compare adjudicated vs. expected rebate
      outcomes, detect leakage patterns, and auto-tune rules; produce
      audit-ready logs and evidence packs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase captured rebate dollars and slash submission cycle time by
    automating contract-to-claim validation and assembly—NDC/period aggregation,
    rule application, and exception triage—with full audit trails and measurable
    ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning contract-to-claim knowledge graph combining clause
    templates, manufacturer-specific idiosyncrasies, and adjudication
    outcomes—improving exception auto-resolution and capture rates over
    time—plus prebuilt packaging connectors and audit artifacts that shorten
    implementation and pass audits faster than general-purpose RPA or rules-only
    tools.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and their captive/independent
      rebate aggregators.

      analogous reimbursement programs (e.g., device warranties, stop-loss
      recoveries).
  channels:

      Direct enterprise sales to mid-size PBMs, regional health plans, and
      specialty pharmacies with a 6–9 month sales cycle; ROI model included.
