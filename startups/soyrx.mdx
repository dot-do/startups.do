  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and agronomists spend 2–6 hours per field converting soil test
      grids/zones into P, K, and lime variable-rate files, blend sheets, and
      application plans.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheets lead to inconsistent prescriptions,
      over/under-application, and difficulty aligning with university/state
      recommendations and 4R Nutrient Stewardship guidelines.
    - >-
      Budgets are not explicitly optimized; few tools simulate ROI under
      fertilizer price and yield response uncertainty, causing 5–15% avoidable
      spend or missed yield.
    - >-
      Operational logistics (truck loads, tendering, field sequence, spreader
      compatibility) are ad hoc, causing 0.5–1.5 lost days during narrow
      application windows.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: soil lab PDFs/CSVs, mixed controller formats (ISOXML,
      shapefile, John Deere, Ag Leader), and multiple zones/grids cause errors
      and rework.
    - >-
      Limited traceability/audits: difficulty proving environmental stewardship
      (e.g., P runoff risk areas, pH correction plans) to landowners, lenders,
      and sustainability programs.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingestion of soil lab data (PDF/CSV/API) and spatial grids/zones;
      automatic QC, unit harmonization, and missing-value handling.
    - >-
      Rule-based + ML prescription engine calibrated to state/university
      guidelines (e.g., Iowa State, Purdue, Ohio State) with user-tunable
      targets (soil test level maintenance/build, yield goals, removal rates).
    - >-
      Economic optimizer that respects budget ceilings and fertilizer/lime
      price/availability, producing Pareto-efficient recs (cost vs. expected
      yield response).
    - >-
      Logistics planner: generates blend sheets, truck/tender loads by product,
      depot-to-field routing, field sequence to minimize deadhead, and
      on-spreader load order.
    - >-
      Controller-ready exports (ISOXML, shapefiles with attribute tables, John
      Deere/Operations Center, Ag Leader, Trimble/Raven) with validation against
      implement capabilities (min/max rates, section width).
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: compare flat vs. VR; different K sources (0-0-60 vs.
      K-Mag), MAP vs. DAP, and lime source fineness/ENP; quantify $/ac and
      expected yield impacts.
    - >-
      Compliance & audit pack: 4R-aligned report with maps (pH zones, low Bray
      P, low exchangeable K), dates, rates, and applicator notes for landlord,
      lender, or sustainability program needs.
    - >-
      Team workflows: multi-user review/approve, versioning, and electronic
      sign-off with change logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Translate soil test grids/zones into economically optimized, logistics-ready
    variable-rate P/K/Lime prescriptions in hours (not days)—with 5–12% average
    fertilizer cost reduction at equivalent or better yield
    potential—export-ready for major controllers and backed by auditable
    4R-aligned documentation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated economic-optimizer that jointly considers agronomic targets and
    real-world logistics (blend rules, truck loads, routing) with cross-lab
    ingestion and instant controller-ready exports—validated by
    university-aligned recs and multi-state field results—delivering measurable
    $/ac gains and operational time savings competitors struggle to replicate.

    Soybean growers and agronomists (NAICS 111110) who want precise, profitable
    P/K/lime on every acre.
  problem: >-
    - External: Soil test grids/zones pile up; variable pH and fertility across
    fields; prescriptions take hours; truck/tender limits complicate execution.

    - Internal: Uncertain what rates to apply and whether they’ll pay back.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to guess—fertility should be clear,
    defensible, and practical to run.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pressure to hit yield while controlling fertilizer
    spend and passes.

    - Authority: Built by agronomists and data scientists; aligns with regional
    agronomy guidelines; supports standard lime ECCE/CCE calculations; exports
    controller-ready files (e.g., ISOXML, SHP).
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Upload soil tests (grid/zone), field boundaries, and product prices.
      2) Get AI-generated variable-rate P, K, and lime recs with target pH, response likelihood, and cost per acre/zone.
      3) Approve, set blends and tender/cart constraints, optimize field order, and export Rx files + job sheets.
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Transparent assumptions; you control constraints and targets.
      - Your data stays yours and private.
      - Start with one field; cancel anytime.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Start a free field trial; Book a 15‑minute setup call.
    - Transitional: Download a sample prescription; Try the ROI calculator.
  success: |-
    - Balanced fertility and optimized pH where it matters most.
    - Lower over‑application and better input ROI.
    - Clear, upfront cost per acre and per field.
    - Smoother logistics: fewer trips, right loads, on‑time execution.
    - Controller-ready files and traceable records for audits.
    - More confident planting with fertility handled.
  failure: |-
    - Keep guessing rates and overspending on flat‑rate.
    - Miss acidic or low‑K zones and lose bushels.
    - Blow budgets, add passes, and slip past ideal application windows.
    - Disorganized files and harder compliance/audits.
