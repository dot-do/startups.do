leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Water-level setup/setdown and short-term seiche in connecting channels
      (e.g., St. Clair, Detroit, St. Marys rivers) cause unpredictable UKC
      shortfalls, forcing last-minute draft reductions or delays
    - >-
      Seasonal and dynamic ice (concentration, ridging, brash) increases transit
      time, hull damage risk, and convoy dependence; current tools lack
      prescriptive timing/route guidance for Great Lakes specifics
    - >-
      Conservative, static margins lead to chronic underloading; 0.5–2.0% cargo
      left on the dock per voyage due to uncertainty around water levels, squat,
      and wave-induced motions
    - >-
      Data is fragmented and latency-prone (gauges, GLOFS forecasts, ice charts,
      AIS, Seaway notices); mariners and load planners lack a fused, explainable
      advisory with quantified outcomes
    - >-
      Unplanned waiting for icebreaker assistance and channel restrictions
      creates demurrage, berth conflicts, and missed laycan windows
    - >-
      Compliance risk with pilotage/port UKC policies and draft restrictions;
      insufficient audit trail to show due diligence to authorities and insurers
    - >-
      Terminals lack forward visibility of risk windows, leading to inefficient
      stow plans, crane gangs, and berth scheduling
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse authoritative hydrodynamics, gauges, forecast models (NOAA GLOFS,
      PORTS/NWLON), Canadian Ice Service products, SAR/altimetry, wind/wave
      models, AIS, and ENC/bathymetry into a single operational view
    - >-
      Dynamic UKC engine combining squat and heel models, wave-induced motions,
      cross-wind/current forces, and channel-specific controlling depths; tuned
      to Great Lakes connecting channels and port approaches
    - >-
      Prescriptive advisor that quantifies outcomes: suggest delaying departure
      by X hours to gain Y cm water level and Z tonnes of lift; slow to reduce
      squat by A cm; use alternate track to avoid ice concentration >B%
    - >-
      Draft window optimizer for terminals: given stow and density, determine
      safe maximum cargo now vs best departure window next 6–48 hours
    - >-
      Ice-aware routing and convoy coordination cues: identify likely choke
      points and recommended timings aligning with USCG/CCG icebreaking updates
    - >-
      What-if planning for load planners and masters: simulate alternative
      drafts, speeds, ETDs, and weather/ice scenarios with UKC and risk scores
    - >-
      Explainable alerts with thresholds and rationale; full audit trail for
      compliance and incident review
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with voyage planning, ECDIS overlays, Veson IMOS,
      Helm, and port community systems; offline cache for patchy connectivity
    - >-
      24/7 ops desk and seasonal “ice cell” support to interpret advisories and
      coordinate with stakeholders
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously predict ice and water-level impacts on draft and UKC, then
    prescribe specific loading, timing, speed, and routing adjustments that
    safely add 0.5–1.5% cargo per voyage and cut ice/water-level delay 10–30%,
    with full auditability for pilots, ports, and insurers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated Great Lakes digital twin combining controlling depths, gauge
    bias-corrected forecasts, ice SAR analytics, and vessel-class squat models,
    validated with pilots and top fleets; exclusive historical dataset linking
    AIS tracks, water levels, and incident records enables superior predictive
    skill and prescriptive accuracy that generalist routing tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Great Lakes and St. Lawrence freight operators (masters, port captains,
    dispatchers, terminal planners) who must keep voyages safe, on time, and
    profitable.
  problem: >-
    External: Ice concentration and water-level swings reduce under-keel
    clearance, forcing conservative drafts, reroutes, and delays. Internal:
    Teams lack one trusted picture to decide when to sail, how much to load, or
    which lane to take. Philosophical: Safe, efficient lake commerce should not
    depend on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of committing ETAs and drafts in volatile
    seasons. Our team blends mariners and data scientists; the service fuses
    NOAA and Canadian Ice Service charts, water-level gauges and forecasts,
    bathymetry, UKC policies, and AIS to quantify route risk.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your vessels, ports, and loading constraints. 2) Receive
    continuous ice and water-level impact assessments on draft/UKC with timing,
    routing, and loading recommendations. 3) Act via dispatch and bridge alerts
    with one-click voyage briefs. Start with a 30-day pilot and a shared UKC
    decision policy we document together.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot. Transitional:
    Download last winter's Great Lakes ice and UKC risk report and a sample
    voyage brief.
  success: >-
    Confident ETAs, optimal drafts, fewer slowdowns and groundings, protected
    hull and props, lower fuel and icebreaker reliance, higher throughput, and
    auditable UKC decisions.
  failure: >-
    Groundings or prop strikes, delays and lightering, missed lock windows,
    overtime and demurrage, fragmented decisions, and eroded margins.

  problem:
    - >-
      Rapidly changing ice and seiche‑driven water levels create hidden UKC
      risk.

      Manual checks across fragmented sources slow decisions and add
      inconsistency.
    - 'Missed windows at locks, bridges, and ports drive costly delays.'
    - Conservative loading to avoid UKC issues leaves revenue on the dock.

    - >-
      Predictive UKC by time and location using ice, water‑level, wind, waves,
      and vessel particulars.
    - >-
      Actionable recommendations: depart/arrive windows, route options, speed,
      ballast, and loading adjustments.
    - >-
      Targeted alerts for ice jams, draft restrictions, and low‑water pinch
      points with lead time.
    - What‑if planning to maximize cargo while maintaining safety margins.
    - 'Simple integrations with AIS, dispatch/TMS, and ECDIS/route planners.'
  features:
    - >-

      AIS reports).
    - Fused water‑level and surge forecasts from NOAA/USACE/Environment Canada.
    - 'Under‑keel clearance engine with squat, heel, and wave‑induced motions.'
    - 'Port, lock, and bridge constraint watchlists with auto alerts.'

    - 'Route optimization across ice severity, draft limits, and fuel burn.'
    - 'Load planner: safe max draft by port call and timing window.'
    - Shared dashboards for bridge and shore with role‑based views.
    - 'API and webhooks for dispatch, stowage, and compliance systems.'
    - Audit trail and decision log for SMS and incident reporting.
  steps:
    - Connect AIS feed and import the voyage plan.
    - 'Enter vessel particulars (LOA, beam, draft curves, ice class, sensors).'
    - System fuses ice and water‑level data to forecast UKC along the route.
    - 'Receive risk scores and recommendations for timing, routing, and loading.'
    - 'Approve actions; updates sync to bridge, dispatch, and customer portals.'
