leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Aged inventory ties up capital and erodes margin: many powersports dealers
      carry 20–35% of units at 90+ days on floorplan.
    - >-
      Floorplan interest at 9–12% APR on $8k–$15k units can cost $50–$120 per 30
      days, destroying gross when units linger.
    - >-
      Pricing is manual, inconsistent, and slow (often weekly); price changes
      are not synchronized across website/marketplaces, causing mismatches and
      MAP risk.
    - >-
      Demand is highly seasonal and regional; managers lack reliable comps and
      elasticity signals to set optimal prices quickly.
    - >-
      Listings grow stale (low VDP views, inquiries) because prices don’t update
      with market shifts or incentives; managers rarely A/B test pricing.
    - >-
      OEM incentives, MAP, and fees create compliance complexity; dealers fear
      auto-pricing without strict guardrails.
    - >-
      Limited staff time: GSM/GM often spend 5–10 hours/week repricing instead
      of selling; stores lack data science capability to do it well.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate DMS and inventory feeds (cost, reconditioning, days-in-stock,
      flooring terms, MAP, incentives) plus website/marketplace listings.
    - >-
      Aggregate real-time comps from Trader marketplaces and local listings;
      normalize by trim, options, miles/hours, condition, seasonality, and geo.
    - >-
      Model demand and elasticity using VDP views, SRP rank, lead rates, and
      macro signals (weather/season, fuel prices, events) to predict
      sell-through at price points.
    - >-
      Recommend price changes and promotion ladders per unit (and bundles) that
      meet guardrails: minimum gross $, MAP, doc/fees, and aging thresholds.
    - >-
      Approval workflow: daily digest or rolling alerts; one-click
      accept/override with reason codes; optional auto-apply within configured
      bounds.
    - >-
      Channel sync: push approved prices to DMS, website, CycleTrader/ATVTrader,
      Facebook Shop, Google Vehicle Listings; ensure fees/MAP rules per channel.
    - >-
      A/B testing engine: test prices or promo hooks and auto-converge to
      winners; track lifts in views, leads, sell-through, and gross.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: quantify incremental gross, floorplan savings, and aging
      reduction vs baseline; export to 20-group reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven dynamic pricing that reduces 90+ day aged units by 30–50%,
    increases inventory turn 10–20%, and cuts floorplan interest $40–$100 per
    retailed unit—while protecting MAP and target gross—on autopilot with
    manager approval and measurable ROI in 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Floorplan-aware price optimization purpose-built for powersports, combining
    proprietary comps + engagement telemetry with strict MAP guardrails and
    instant multi-channel sync. As the dataset compounds (prices, leads,
    sell-through), model accuracy and playbooks become uniquely defensible;
    early integrations and ROI case studies create switching costs.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

      and A/B testing.

  character: >-
    GM/owner or sales manager at a motorcycle, ATV, and powersports dealership
    (NAICS 441227) who must price competitively, turn inventory faster, and
    protect margins while managing floorplan costs.
  problem: >-
    External:

    - Aged units tie up cash as floorplan and depreciation mount.

    - Market prices shift daily across comps, seasons, and regions.

    - Manual repricing is slow, inconsistent, and hard to defend.

    - Promotions are guesswork and often mistimed.

    Internal:

    - Anxiety about missing the market or racing to the bottom.

    - Pressure to hit turns without sacrificing gross.

    - Team lacks a single source of truth for pricing decisions.

    Philosophical:

    - Pricing should be fair, data-driven, and simple to execute—dealers
    shouldn’t lose margin to stale data or guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy:

    - We understand floorplan pressure, seasonality, and model-year transitions
    in powersports.

    Authority:

    - Built by retail operators and data scientists for dealerships.

    - Secure, privacy-focused implementation with role-based controls.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect: Link DMS and listing feeds; pull comps, demand signals, and
    floorplan terms.

    approval workflows.

    3) Optimize: Get daily price/promo recommendations; auto-apply with your
    approval; monitor and iterate.

    Agreement Plan:

    - You stay in control—nothing changes without approval or pre-set rules.

    - Transparent reasoning and audit trail for every change.

    - Easy rollback; safeguards for minimum gross and brand policies.

    - Data privacy and role-based access baked in.
