  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers struggle to self-select safe, effective OTC remedies based on
      symptoms, leading to decision paralysis, low confidence, and suboptimal
      choices.
    - >-
      Pharmacists spend 20–60 minutes per day on repetitive front-of-store
      consultations, reducing time for higher-value clinical tasks.
    - >-
      Retailers lack a scalable, consistent way to triage red-flag symptoms and
      direct at-risk customers to pharmacist intervention.
    - >-
      Online search and generic symptom checkers do not map to in-store
      inventory, private labels, or planograms, resulting in lost conversions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent product recommendations and poor product education lead to
      returns, misuse, and lower customer satisfaction.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational symptom intake with pharmacy-authored decision pathways
      tuned for OTC use cases (cold/flu, pain, allergies, GI, dermatology, minor
      injuries, sleep, etc.).
    - >-
      Red-flag detection engine (age, pregnancy/lactation, interactions,
      duration/severity, comorbidities) to trigger pharmacist handoff or care
      navigation.
    - >-
      Inventory- and planogram-aware product mapping (brand vs private label,
      size/form, aisle/shelf location, price and promos).
    - >-
      Personalization safeguards: allergy checks, common drug class conflicts,
      condition-specific contraindications, pediatric dosing awareness (no
      dosing instructions provided; directs to label/pharmacist).
    - >-
      Pharmacist console for escalations, quick-reply templates, and audit
      trails; web widget + in-store QR codes linking to store-specific
      experiences.
    - >-
      Multilingual UX (e.g., English/Spanish at launch; roadmap: French,
      Simplified Chinese); accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA).
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: conversion lift, escalation rates, red-flag
      precision/recall, customer satisfaction, and time saved.
    - >-
      Enterprise-grade privacy, SOC 2 alignment, PII/PHI minimization,
      configurable retention, and model guardrails specific to OTC triage.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
