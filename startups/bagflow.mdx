leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      BRS exceptions (no-match, missing scan, wrong pier, short connections) are
      frequent and resolved manually via phone/radio, causing slow clears and
      bag jams.
    - >-
      Legacy BRS/BHS alarms are noisy and unprioritized; critical
      transfer-at-risk bags compete with low-impact alerts.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across BRS, AODB, DCS, BHS PLC/SCADA, and ground handler
      tools—there is no unified view or single queue of work.
    - >-
      Stakeholder ownership is unclear (airport vs. airline vs. ground handler),
      leading to delays and finger-pointing during IROPS and bank peaks.
    - >-
      Exception-to-clear times are long; missed connections and must-offload
      events increase mishandled bag rates and costs.
    - >-
      Airports face staffing shortages and high turnover; tribal knowledge of
      playbooks is not codified, hurting consistency and training.
    - >-
      Compliance pressures (IATA Res. 753 tracking, airline SLAs) require better
      traceability and audit trails than radio calls and spreadsheets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time data fusion: Ingest BRS scan events, BHS telemetry/alarms,
      flight schedules (AODB), DCS passenger/bag match, and staffing rosters to
      create a single prioritized exception queue.
    - >-
      AI triage: Classify and score exceptions by passenger/flight impact (e.g.,
      transfer time left, aircraft ETD, bag VIP/PRM status), equipment state,
      and historical resolution efficacy.
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks: Recommend next-best actions (re-scan, divert,
      manual pull, alternative pier, handler dispatch) with one-click tasking
      and auto-escalations across airport, airline, and handler teams.
    - >-
      Field execution: Dispatch to handhelds (Zebra/Honeywell) with barcode/RFID
      scan workflows, photos, and closed-loop e-signoff; offline-capable with
      sync.
    - >-
      Dynamic risk mitigation: Predict short-connection misses and must-offload
      candidates; suggest proactive bag pulls or alternate routing (within
      airport rules).
    - >-
      Cross-org ChatOps: Secure channels tied to each case; replace radio/phone
      handoffs with traceable, role-based communication and audit trails.
    - >-
      Ops cockpit: Heatmaps of jam likelihood, live queue status, SLA timers,
      and runway-to-belt throughput; post-ops analytics with root-cause and CI
      suggestions.
    - >-
      Open integration: Pre-built connectors for SITA/Amadeus BRS, Brock
      SmartSuite, OEM BHS interfaces, AODB (e.g., Veovo, Collins), and airline
      DCS; REST/stream APIs.
    - >-
      Deployment options: Cloud + on-prem edge appliance for low-latency
      ingestion and local failover; SOC 2/ISO 27001-ready design, PII
      minimization, and RBAC/SSO.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce mishandled bags by 10–25% and clear jams 30–50% faster without
    replacing existing BRS/BHS—an AI-driven triage and orchestration layer that
    unifies alerts, predicts risk, and coordinates the right action with the
    right role at the right time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic overlay with pre-certified connectors and an airport-trained
    exception taxonomy/playbook library, backed by a growing proprietary dataset
    of resolutions and outcomes; deployable as a low-latency edge solution that
    coordinates cross-organization actions and offers outcome-based pricing to
    de-risk procurement.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary buyers: Airport operations leaders (AOCC, baggage operations
      managers), Airport IT/Innovation, large hub airlines’ station/ground ops,
      and common-use ground handlers.
    - >-
      Early adopters: North American airports with 10–40M annual passengers,
      common-use BRS, multiple carriers with transfer banks, mishandling >5 per
      1,000 bags, and recurring BHS jam/congestion patterns.
    - >-
      Economic influencers: Airport COO/CIO, airline baggage services directors,
      ground handling regional managers; stakeholders include BHS OEM service
      managers and AOCC duty managers.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct enterprise sales to airports and hub airlines; pursue AOCC and
      baggage ops leadership with problem-focused demos and PoV offers.
    - >-

  character: >-
    Airport and airline baggage operations leaders (ground handlers, baggage
    control, ramp, and load control) who must keep bags reconciled, belts
    flowing, and flights on time.
  problem: >-
    Peak-time BRS exceptions create jams and broken handoffs; manual triage and
    scattered comms slow clearance, driving misconnects, higher MBR, delays, and
    rising costs.
  guide: >-
    Baggage Reconciliation Exception Resolver is an AI copilot for the bag room
    that triages exceptions, recommends best‑next‑actions, and orchestrates
    tasks with ramp, security, and load control—integrated with BRS/BHS/DCS and
    compliant with IATA Resolution 753.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Securely integrate with your BRS/BHS/DCS and messaging
    (BSM/BTM/BUM).

    - Pilot: Run a 30-day trial in one zone with agreed KPIs and clear
    playbooks.

    - Scale: Roll out station-wide with training, 24/7 support, and continuous
    tuning.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and choose a pilot window. Transitional:
    Request the pilot checklist and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Faster exception clearance, fewer jams, lower mishandled-bag rate, improved
    OTP and SLA compliance, less overtime, and calmer, predictable operations
    with happier passengers.
  failure: >-
    Without a resolver, exceptions pile up; belts stop, rush bags miss flights,
    audits flag noncompliance, costs and complaints surge, and teams remain
    stuck in firefighting mode.

  problem:
    - 'BRS exceptions pile up, blocking belts and delaying departures.'
    - Manual radio/call triage burns ramp time and misses priorities.
    - 'Systems are siloed: BRS, BHS, DCS, and scanner data don’t align.'
    - 'Near close-out, misconnect risk spikes without clear triage.'
    - No closed-loop verification; bags fall through the cracks.
    - SLA penalties and mishandled bag costs keep rising.

  solution:
    - Real-time triage of BRS exceptions with root-cause classification.
    - Prescriptive fix recommendations with step-by-step playbooks.
    - 'Auto-coordination across baggage, ramp, airline stations, and handlers.'
    - >-

      APIs.
    - 'Verification: Confirms scans/system states before closing a case.'
    - 'Ops Wallboard: Live backlog, risk heatmap, and throughput view.'
    - 'KPIs & Reporting: MBR, mean time to clear, RUSH rate, SLA adherence.'
    - 'Integrations: Standard airport/airline interfaces; SSO and RBAC.'
    - 'Deployment Options: Cloud or airport edge with offline resilience.'
    - 'Security: PII minimization, encryption, and full audit logging.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect: Link BRS/BHS/DCS and scanner feeds; set auth and scopes.'
    - 'Configure: Import SOPs; define SLAs, roles, handoffs, and escalations.'
    - 'Calibrate: Train on 2–4 weeks of historical exceptions and outcomes.'
