  problem:
    - >-
      Frontlist buying is guesswork: title performance is volatile and
      store-specific, driving 15–25% returns for new books and 60%+ returns for
      many magazine categories.
    - >-
      Capital is tied up in slow-moving titles; buyers need a way to maximize
      GMROI and hit sell-through targets while respecting budget and shelf
      constraints.
    - >-
      Existing tools (POS reorder reports, wholesaler portals) are
      backward-looking and generic; they don’t ingest pre-release signals or
      model store-level demand for brand-new SKUs.
    - >-
      Buyers spend 4–10 hours per week scanning catalogs, Edelweiss, and social
      buzz to make initial buys; decisions are inconsistent across staff.
    - >-
      News dealers face low magazine sell-through (30–40% typical) with limited
      local signal and poor alignment to fixture capacity and neighborhood
      demographics.
    - >-
      High cost of returns and freight, plus short return windows and lead-time
      uncertainty, penalize overbuying and late reorders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Title scoring engine: predicts 30/60/90-day unit demand per store for
      upcoming titles/issues using pre-release signals (catalog metadata, comps,
      preorders, BookScan trends, social sentiment, local demographics, events).
    - >-
      Budget-constrained buy optimizer: proposes initial quantities that meet
      sell-through and GMROI targets while honoring budget, shelf/fixture space,
      case-pack, vendor minimums, and lead times.
    - >-
      Explainability and trust: rationale per recommendation (top signals,
      comps, local drivers, uncertainty bands) plus sensitivity analysis (e.g.,
      if budget +10%, margin impact).
    - >-
      Workflow integration: push POs via EDI to Ingram, B&T, PRH, Hachette, and
      magazine wholesalers; ingest acknowledgements and ASN; auto-track reprints
      and delays.
    - >-
      Alerts and rebuys: detect early momentum or underperformance, recommend
      quick reorders or returns within windows; event- and media-triggered
      demand bumps.
    - >-
      Magazine allocation module (news dealers): optimize draws by location and
      category to raise sell-through and reduce spoilage, with fixture-based
      caps and day-of-week patterns.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Order the right new titles, in the right quantities, for each store the
    first time—boost 60/90-day sell-through by 5–10 points, cut returns 5–10
    points, and improve GMROI 10–20%, with explainable AI recommendations and
    one-click EDI ordering.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-store network effects and pre-release signal graph that improve
    cold-start accuracy; deep EDI and POS integrations enabling one-click
    execution; proprietary cost-of-returns modeling and constraint solver tuned
    to book and magazine idiosyncrasies; growing dataset of localized event
    impacts and BookTok/media surges not available in generic demand tools.
