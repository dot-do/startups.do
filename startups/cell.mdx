  problem:
    - >-
      Rising and volatile electricity costs at cell sites (demand charges and
      TOU tariffs drive 20–50% of monthly bills).
    - >-
      Operators underuse vendor energy-saving features (sleep modes, carrier
      shutdown, MIMO layer adaptation) due to QoS risk and operational
      complexity.
    - >-
      Tariff complexity (thousands of TOU and demand-charge structures) and
      weather/traffic variability make manual scheduling ineffective.
    - >-
      Sustainability pressures (Scope 2 reductions, RE100, SBTi) require
      measurable, auditable energy and emissions savings.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous networks (4G/5G, multi-vendor, macro/micro/small cells) lack
      a unified, vendor-agnostic optimizer.
    - >-
      Limited measurement and verification (M&V) frameworks to credibly quantify
      savings without confounding traffic/QoS impacts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-intrusive data ingestion from OSS/EMS/SON and RAN counters
      (eNodeB/gNodeB KPIs, traffic loads, alarms) at 1–5 minute granularity.
    - >-
      AI-driven policy engine that schedules energy features (carrier/sleep
      modes, MIMO layer scaling, RF chain muting, cooling setpoints) by cluster,
      hour, and season.
    - >-
      Tariff and demand-charge optimizer: forecasts cost by TOU tiers, demand
      windows, and critical-peak events; shifts discretionary load while
      preserving QoS SLAs.
    - >-
      Digital twin/sandbox: simulate policies against historical traffic and
      weather; A/B test vs. control clusters before rollout.
    - >-
      Closed-loop orchestration via standardized interfaces (Itf-N,
      NetConf/YANG, vendor APIs, RIC xApps/rApps) with automated rollback and
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Measurement & Verification (M&V): weather-, traffic-, and
      tariff-normalized baselining (IPMVP Option C style) with transparent
      savings reports and audit trails.
    - >-
      Edge-aware deployment for low latency command execution; optional on-prem
      for high-security environments.
    - >-
      Emissions-aware optimization using marginal grid emissions signals to
      time-shift discretionary load where feasible.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce per-site energy 12–22% (median target) with provable QoS protection
    by aligning RAN energy features to real-time traffic, tariffs, and
    weather—vendor-agnostic, measurable, and deployable in weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic energy orchestration with verifiable M&V and QoS guardrails,
    backed by prebuilt connectors across major RAN/SON ecosystems and a
    tariff-aware optimization engine; defensible via datasets, integration
    know-how, and compliance posture that are difficult and slow to replicate.

  character: >-
    Network operations and energy leaders at wireless carriers (NAICS 517112)
    who want to cut RAN site energy costs and emissions without risking
    QoS/SLAs.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile energy prices, complex time-of-use tariffs, 5G
    densification, vendor-fragmented features, and manual site tuning at scale.
    Internal: Fear that savings will degrade KPIs; limited visibility and
    control create hesitation and fire drills. Philosophical: Connectivity
    shouldn’t waste power—every watt should serve customer experience and
    sustainability.
  guide: >-
    We understand carrier-grade stakes and change-control. Built by telecom and
    power engineers, we combine RAN domain expertise with AI optimization.
    Proven pilots show double-digit energy savings with zero KPI regressions.
    Secure, compliant, and integrable with major RAN vendors, OSS/BSS, meters,
    and BMS—backed by clear guardrails and audit trails.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Assess: safe, read-only data ingest (KPIs, tariffs,
    topology). 2) Pilot: A/B clusters with QoS guardrails and what-if
    simulations. 3) Rollout: automate policies via approved change windows with
    instant rollback. 4) Optimize: continuous tuning and reporting. Agreement
    plan: QoS/KPI guardrails, data residency and security, SLA on availability
    and rollback, clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute feasibility assessment or launch a 6–8 week pilot.
    Transitional: Get a savings benchmark and ROI calculator, plus a technical
    brief.
  success: >-
    10–25% reduction in site energy and peak demand; maintained or improved QoS;
    lower OPEX and CO2; faster progress on ESG targets; tariff- and
    traffic-aware automation across vendors; clear ROI in months and a scalable
    playbook for nationwide rollout.
  failure: >-
    Continued energy overspend, missed ESG targets, grid curtailment risks,
    unnecessary diesel runs, KPI incidents from manual tuning, and falling
    behind more efficient competitors.
