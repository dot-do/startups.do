  problem:
    - >-
      Proposal and applications engineering teams spend 6–20 hours per tender
      manually reading specs and building compliance matrices, exceptions lists,
      and submittal registers.
    - >-
      Critical requirements are missed or misinterpreted, causing non-compliant
      bids and disqualifications; post-mortems often reveal 1–3 preventable
      misses per quarter.
    - >-
      Subject-matter experts are tied up on low-leverage tasks (spec parsing)
      instead of solution design and price strategy, increasing bid costs by
      15–30%.
    - >-
      Tender document packages are fragmented across PDFs, scans, addenda,
      drawings, and emails; tracking revisions and addenda is error-prone and
      un-audited.
    - >-
      Institutional knowledge of prior bids, standard clauses, and typical
      exceptions remains tribal; new team members ramp slowly (8–12 weeks) and
      re-make past mistakes.
    - >-
      Q&A windows are short; teams struggle to draft specific, answerable
      questions that unlock clarifications and reduce risk.
    - >-
      Submittal schedules and certifications (e.g., AWWA, UL/FM, NIST HB44/OIML,
      fuel dispensing, metering) are inconsistently captured, leading to late or
      incomplete submittals.
    - >-
      Distributors/rep channels vary in process maturity; headquarters has
      limited visibility into compliance quality and pipeline risk across
      regions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-source ingestion: drag-drop or auto-fetch tender PDFs, scans,
      drawings, specs, addenda, and emails; version tracking with addendum
      diffs.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned extraction: identify and normalize requirements into a
      compliance matrix with fields (ID, clause text, spec section, must/should,
      test/cert standard, acceptance method, due date).
    - >-
      Exceptions assistant: auto-suggest exceptions/clarifications with
      rationale, risk tags, and alternative proposals (e.g., equivalent
      certifications, performance bands).
    - >-
      Submittal register builder: auto-generate submittal schedule (datasheets,
      curves, P&IDs, QA/QC plans, calibration certificates, UL/FM,
      AWWA/NIST/OIML) with owners and due dates.
    - >-
      Q&A drafting: produce precise, time-bound, non-leading clarification
      questions tied to clause IDs; de-duplicate and prioritize to fit portal
      limits.
    - >-
      Spec-to-catalog matcher: map requirements to your product master (SKUs,
      options, certifications), highlight spec breaks/partials, and capture
      assumptions.
    - >-
      Change tracking: detect addenda deltas; update matrices, exceptions, and
      submittals; notify owners of impacted items.
    - >-
      Risk scoring: compliance coverage %, open risks, unresolved exceptions,
      missing submittals; trend by bid and by region/rep.
    - >-
      Collaboration & audit: assign owners, comment threads, approval workflows;
      audit trail for every clause and decision.
    - >-
      Integrations: SharePoint/Teams/Outlook, Salesforce/Microsoft Dynamics,
      common bid portals (download automation where permitted), PLM/ERP for
      specs and certifications.
    - >-
      Security & deployment: SOC 2-ready, SSO; options for single-tenant VPC or
      on-prem inference; content controls to exclude proprietary data from model
      training.
    - >-
      Export/packaging: one-click export to Excel/CSV (compliance matrix),
      Word/PDF (exception letters, cover letters), and portal-ready formats.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn complex tender packages into an actionable, auditable compliance
    package—requirements matrix, exceptions log, submittal register, and Q&A
    drafts—in minutes, tuned to measuring/dispensing/pumping equipment standards
    and workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned compliance taxonomy and models trained on thousands of
    measuring/dispensing/pumping tenders and submittal packages, plus deep
    integrations to OEM product masters and certifications—enabling
    spec-to-catalog matching, standards normalization, and exception suggestions
    that generic RFP tools can’t match. Private VPC/on-prem deployment options
    reduce InfoSec friction and accelerate enterprise adoption.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Proposal managers, sales engineers, and compliance leads at measuring,
    dispensing, and other pumping equipment manufacturers (NAICS 333914) who
    must quickly qualify, comply with, and respond to complex tenders.
  problem: >-
    External: Tender packages sprawl across specs, Ts&Cs, drawings, and addenda;
    building compliance matrices, exceptions, and submittals manually is slow
    and error‑prone. Internal: Teams feel overloaded and fear missing hidden
    musts that sink bids. Philosophical: Great engineering should win on merit,
    not get buried by paperwork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pump bid cycle and the risks of non‑compliance. Our AI,
    tuned for pump‑industry specs and standards (e.g., API/ASME/NACE/UL/ATEX),
    turns tender packages into traceable requirement matrices, exceptions lists,
    submittal registers, and Q&A drafts—fast and dependable.
  plan: >-
    - Upload the tender package and addenda (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/drawings)

    - Review the AI‑built compliance matrix with clause‑level traceability and
    confidence cues

    - Confirm exceptions, submittals, and Q&A; export to
    Excel/Word/SharePoint/ERP and assign owners

    - Optional: Set rules and templates to standardize outputs across product
    lines and regions
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot on your next RFP.
    Transitional: Download a sample compliance matrix and tender response
    checklist.
  success: >-
    - Faster go/no‑go and response cycles

    - Higher compliance scores with fewer clarifications

    - Clear, defensible exceptions and commercial positions

    - Complete submittal tracking (datasheets, curves, IOM, QA certs)

    - Standardized, audit‑ready deliverables that improve win rates and protect
    margins

    - Engineers spend more time on solutions, less on paperwork
  failure: >-
    - Missed mandatory requirements and late submissions

    - Disqualified bids or costly change orders from overlooked exceptions

    - Margin erosion, rework, and fire‑drill reviews

    - Lost credibility with buyers and lost deals to faster, more compliant
    competitors
