leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Captains spend 20–40 minutes per trip manually entering e-logbook data
      (species codes, statistical areas, gear/effort, lat/long), increasing
      fatigue and reducing time on operations.
    - >-
      Dynamic closures, rotational access areas, and overlapping state/federal
      rules are hard to interpret at sea; inadvertent non-compliance risks fines
      ($1,000–$10,000+) and license points.
    - >-
      Multiple, duplicative reporting systems (NOAA GARFO eVTR/SAFIS eTRIPS,
      state trip reports, dealer reporting) create double entry and inconsistent
      records.
    - >-
      Connectivity gaps offshore lead to delayed or failed submissions and
      late-reporting violations.
    - >-
      Fleet managers lack real-time visibility into compliance risk and
      reporting status across vessels/trips.
    - >-
      Existing e-logbook tools are manual-first, not integrated with VMS/AIS or
      gear sensors, leading to error-prone data and rejected submissions.
    - >-
      Frequent regulation changes (closures, area codes, IFQ/ITQ updates)
      require constant monitoring and re-training.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted e-logbook auto-drafter that ingests VMS/AIS/GPS tracks and
      known fishing patterns to propose tow/dredge events, statistical areas,
      gear/effort, and species defaults.
    - >-
      Geofenced compliance engine that overlays current federal/state closures,
      rotational access areas, and IFQ/ITQ rules to provide real-time pre-tow
      alerts and catch/quota pre-checks.
    - >-
      Certified eVTR preparation and queued submission with captain e-signature;
      resilient offline mode auto-syncs when connectivity returns.
    - >-
      Rules update service that continuously ingests regulator shapefiles,
      bulletins, and notice-to-fishers to keep the onboard rulebook current.
    - >-
      Fleet dashboard with live compliance status, trip progress, submission
      success, and violation-prevention analytics.
    - >-
      Dealer/processor and quota system integrations for pre-landing
      reconciliation and reduced data discrepancies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-tap, regulation-ready trip reports with real-time area compliance.
    ShellSafe AutoLog pre-fills 90–95% of required fields from VMS/AIS and prior
    trips, flags violations before they happen, and submits eVTRs for captain
    sign-off—even offline—cutting reporting time by 70%+ and reducing rejected
    submissions to <1%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Certified, regulator-aligned rules engine plus on-vessel auto-drafting
    trained on real scallop/clam trip patterns; embedded distribution through
    VMS partners and insurer incentives create switching costs and a trust moat.
    Compliance Assurance program offers credits if a verified system error
    causes a rejected submission, signaling confidence and reducing buyer risk.
