  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering teams lose 10–40% of developer time waiting on CI due to
      suboptimal caching, serial jobs, and imbalanced test shards.
    - >-
      CI compute costs (GitHub Actions, GitLab Runners, CircleCI, Buildkite,
      Jenkins on cloud) escalate 20–60% YoY without clear attribution or
      optimization levers.
    - >-
      Matrix builds and parallelism are often misconfigured, causing unnecessary
      job fan-out or idle runners, increasing cost with little wall-time
      benefit.
    - >-
      Caching keys are brittle or overly broad; frequent cache misses/rebuilds
      add 10–30% to pipeline time and cost.
    - >-
      Test suites exhibit long-tail imbalance and flakiness; shards are uneven,
      causing bottlenecks and reruns that inflate wall time and reduce
      reliability.
    - >-
      Lack of cross-repo and historical observability prevents data-driven
      tuning; teams rely on trial-and-error changes in YAML that are risky and
      slow to iterate.
    - >-
      Monorepos and polyglot stacks complicate optimal strategy selection across
      languages, build tools, and frameworks.
    - >-
      Platform/DevOps teams have limited bandwidth to maintain CI tuning as
      codebases, dependencies, and team structures evolve.
    - >-
      Compliance/policy constraints (secrets, isolated runners, self-hosted
      agents) reduce ability to try new optimization patterns safely.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks verified, auditable savings reports to justify CI spend
      and platform investments.
  solution:
    - >-
      Lightweight agent and API integrations ingest job logs, timing, cache
      events, and artifact metadata from CI providers and test frameworks.
    - >-
      Optimization engine recommends and auto-applies changes to caching keys,
      restore/save scopes, and dependency layering to maximize reuse and reduce
      invalidations.
    - >-
      Adaptive parallelism adjusts concurrency based on historical runtimes and
      queue depth to minimize p95 wall time without over-provisioning runners.
    - >-
      Dynamic matrix pruning predicts low-risk combinations (OS/runtime/arch) to
      skip or downsample while preserving coverage SLAs with statistical
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Test sharding balances shards by historical and recent timings; integrates
      with common test runners; supports flaky test quarantine and retry
      strategies.
    - >-
      Right-sizing of runners allocates CPU/RAM/storage per job; proposes
      ephemeral or spot instances where safe; enforces cost-aware queueing
      policies.
    - >-
      Auto-PRs to CI configs (YAML) and test runner configs with inline
      explanations, diffs, and one-click rollback; gated by code owners and
      policies.
    - >-
      Safe canary and A/B experiment framework to validate savings on a subset
      of branches/workflows before org-wide rollout.
    - >-
      End-to-end CI observability with cost attribution per job, repo, and team;
      trend dashboards for p50/p95 duration, cache hit rates, and flake rate.
    - >-
      Compliance-aware mode (no source checkout; PII-free telemetry) and on-prem
      option for self-hosted runners.
    - >-
      Savings verification reports tie compute minutes and cloud cost deltas to
      specific optimizations for finance and leadership.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut CI wall time by 25–50% and compute cost by 20–40% in 30–60 days, with
    zero app code changes. The AI optimizer continuously tunes caching,
    parallelism, matrix strategy, and test sharding across CI vendors, shipping
    safe auto-PRs and verified savings reports.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, vendor-agnostic optimizer that auto-generates safe, reversible
    PRs with experiment-based verification, powered by a growing proprietary
    corpus of multi-language pipeline traces and timing data. This enables
    faster, more accurate, and lower-risk optimizations than point tools or
    vendor-native features, with auditable savings for FinOps.
