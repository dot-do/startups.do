  problem:
    - >-
      Highly variable ore hardness, grade, and mineralogy lead to unstable
      SAG/Ball mill and flotation performance, causing lost recovery and
      throughput.
    - >-
      Manual setpoint tuning struggles with multivariate trade-offs (grind P80,
      cyclone pressure, air rate, froth depth, reagent dosage, pH, feed rate)
      under changing conditions.
    - >-
      Assay delays (lab turnaround 1–8 hours) create blind spots; operators rely
      on lagging indicators and rules-of-thumb.
    - >-
      Energy and reagent costs are rising; plants lack real-time
      cost-to-recovery optimization.
    - >-
      Existing APC systems are underutilized or not tuned to current ore blends;
      AI pilots often stall due to integration challenges and lack of operator
      trust.
    - >-
      Plant teams lack a quantifiable, continuous method to measure incremental
      value from setpoint changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multivariate recommendation engine delivering setpoints (every 5–10
      minutes) for mill feed rate, mill load/charge density targets, cyclone
      pressure/splits, grind P80, flotation air rate, froth depth, reagent
      dosage, pH, and pull rates.
    - >-
      Soft sensors that predict recovery, concentrate grade, and tails grade
      using OSAs (on-stream analyzers), froth vision, PSD analyzers, and
      historian signals; calibrated to lab assays.
    - >-
      Economic optimizer that balances recovery, throughput, energy (kWh/t),
      water, and reagents ($/t), honoring hard constraints (equipment limits,
      safety interlocks) and operating envelopes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optional control via existing APC/MPC (or advisory-only mode
      with operator acceptance workflow).
    - >-
      Drift-aware models with adaptive retraining based on ore
      blending/seasonality; champion-challenger testing and A/B value trials.
    - >-
      Operator HMI with explainability (feature attribution, confidence,
      constraint visibility), and an audit trail for governance and training.
    - >-
      Value tracking module that quantifies uplift vs. counterfactual baseline
      using causal inference and production accounting.

    Plant managers, metallurgists, and control room operators at gold/silver
    concentrators who want higher recovery and stable throughput at the lowest
    cost.
  problem: >-
    Ore variability and complex SAG/Ball milling–flotation interactions make
    manual setpoint tuning guesswork—causing lost metal to tails, energy/reagent
    waste, and missed ounce targets. It shouldn’t require heroics to balance
    recovery, throughput, and cost.

    metallurgists, control engineers, and data scientists. We understand your
    circuit, respect operator control, and provide transparent, constraint-aware
    recommendations aligned to site KPIs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect & baseline: integrate historian/DCS/lab data, map tags, define
    constraints/KPIs. 2) Model & validate: build multivariate dynamic models,
    backtest on your data, review with your team. 3) Go live: advisory setpoints
    (or supervised closed-loop), operator training, safeguards, and continuous
    improvement.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute plant assessment. Transitional: Request a
    historical-data pilot and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    More Au/Ag recovered with steadier throughput and grind size; lower kWh/t,
    reagent per ounce, and water use; fewer upsets; empowered operators;

  failure: >-
    Continue chasing variability, leaving metal in tails, overgrinding,
    overspending on energy/reagents, and missing production and cost targets
    while setpoints drift with each ore change.
