      Parse PDFs and CAD to extract part count, materials, thickness, finishes,
      tolerances.
    - >-
      Recognize features (bends, holes, hems, countersinks, PEMs) from CAD and
      compute flat pattern.
    - >-
      Select routing (laser/punch → deburr → bend → hardware insertion →
      weld/finish).
    - >-
      Estimate setup/run time per operation with parametric models and
      shop-specific rates.
    - Compute material usage (nesting pre-estimate) and scrap factors.
    - 'Flag risks (tight GD&T, small flanges, special tooling).'
    - >-
      Generate quote (line items, lead time, terms) and push to CRM/ERP; enable
      human review/override.
    - Send quote and track status.
  tools:

  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive via fragmented channels (email, portals, PDFs, spreadsheets)
      and require 30–120 minutes of manual parsing per RFQ, creating backlogs
      and slow quote turnarounds (often 24–72 hours).
    - >-
      Critical details (material, thickness, finish, quantities, tolerances,
      delivery/Incoterms) are frequently missing or buried in attachments,
      causing rework, errors, and missed requirements.
    - >-
      Geometry-driven effort is hard to estimate consistently; tribal knowledge
      leads to quote variance, margin leakage, and poor predictability.
    - >-
      Estimators are scarce and expensive; throughput is capped at ~80–200
      RFQs/month per estimator, constraining growth and responsiveness.
    - >-
      Current tools don’t automate intake-to-quote end-to-end; point solutions
      require manual data entry or don’t integrate with ERP/MRP or email
      inboxes.
    - >-
      Inaccurate or slow quotes reduce win rates by 10–20% versus faster
      competitors; complex aerospace/medical RFQs exacerbate compliance burdens
      and cycle times.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks visibility: no standard KPIs for quote cycle time, margin
      accuracy, estimator utilization, or lost RFQs due to incomplete intake.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified RFQ intake: connect shared inboxes (Outlook/Gmail), portals, and
      drag-and-drop; automatically correlate emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, and CAD
      files into a single RFQ record.
    - >-
      AI extraction: parse line items, quantities, due dates,
      materials/finishes/tolerances; 2D (DXF/DWG) and 3D (STEP, SLDPRT) feature
      extraction (bend count, angles, flat pattern area, pierce count, hardware
      callouts).
    - >-
      Shop-specific cost modeling: translate detected features to routings
      (laser/punch → bend → hardware → weld → coat → inspect) with
      machine-specific rates, setup times, yields, and scrap; live material
      pricing options.
    - >-
      Quote drafting: auto-generate pricing, lead time, and cover letter with
      terms; produce customer-ready PDF and portal uploads; confidence scoring
      and human-in-the-loop approval.
    - >-
      Integrations: sync customers/items/parts with ERP/MRP (JobBOSS², E2/ECi,
      ProShop, Epicor), update CRM, and push routings/BOMs upon award.
    - >-
      Analytics and feedback: track RFQ-to-quote cycle time, estimator
      utilization, quote win rate, and margin MAE; continuous model tuning from
      outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From RFQ to first-pass quote in minutes. FormQuote AI automatically ingests
    RFQs, extracts requirements and geometry features, estimates
    time/material/cost with shop-specific models, and drafts ready-to-send
    quotes—cutting cycle time by 60–80%, increasing estimator throughput 2–4x,
    and improving margin accuracy by 2–4 points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on real RFQ→quote→win/loss→actuals data across diverse
    shops yields rapidly compounding accuracy in both extraction and cost
    estimation. Deep ERP/email/CAD integrations and a HITL workflow tuned to
    estimators allow true intake-to-quote automation that competitors focused on
    point quoting or CAD only cannot easily replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Estimators and sales teams at sheet metal job shops and contract
    manufacturers who need fast, accurate quotes to win more work without adding
    headcount.
  problem: >-
    RFQs arrive as messy emails, PDFs, and CAD files. Manual feature extraction
    and time/cost estimation is slow and inconsistent—creating quote backlogs,
    pricing errors, missed deadlines, and lost margin.
  guide: >-
    RFQ Intake-to-Quote Automation pairs deep sheet-metal manufacturing know‑how
    with production‑grade AI. We understand RFQ spikes, thin margins, and tribal
    knowledge. Our secure, auditable system integrates with your CAD/CAM and ERP
    to make quoting predictable, consistent, and trustworthy.
  plan: >-
    1) Onboard your shop data (rates, machines, materials) and connect
    email/portals plus CAD/CAM/ERP. 2) AI parses RFQs (PDF/DXF/STEP), extracts
    features, flags risks (tolerances, finishes), estimates time/cost with your
    rules, and drafts quotes in your template. 3) Review margins, approve, and
    send; sync to ERP and continuously improve from outcomes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo with your RFQs. Transitional: Get the ROI
    calculator and sample quote pack.
  success: >-
    Quotes go out same day with consistent pricing. Win rate rises, margins are
    protected, throughput scales without extra estimators, and customers get
    faster, clearer responses with full traceability.
  failure: >-
    Quoting stays slow and error‑prone—deadlines are missed, bids are lost,
    margins leak, and the business remains dependent on a few overworked
    experts, risking growth and customer trust.
