leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Alarm floods overwhelm controllers during compressor trips, power blips,
      or telecom outages: 100–1,000+ alarms in 10 minutes vs EEMUA 191 target of
      ≤10 alarms/10 minutes per operator.
    - >-
      Cascading/duplicate alarms across RTUs, stations, and dependent control
      loops obscure the initiating fault; operators spend 10–30 minutes triaging
      during upsets.
    - >-
      Root cause identification relies on tribal knowledge; handovers lose
      context; inconsistent actions drive longer MTTR and unnecessary
      callouts/line balance changes.
    - >-
      Spurious alarms from bad data quality (telemetry dropouts, stale
      timestamps, stuck values) erode trust and create alarm fatigue.
    - >-
      Compliance friction: PHMSA CRM (49 CFR 192.631) and API 1167 require alarm
      rationalization and performance monitoring; current reporting is manual,
      error-prone, and quarterly at best.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either static alarm rationalization databases or
      generic analytics; they lack pipeline topology/context (valves,
      compressors, regulator stations, linepack) and provide limited real-time
      guidance.
    - >-
      Safety and cybersecurity constraints prohibit autonomous control;
      advisory-only tools must be low-latency, high-reliability, and read-only
      to SCADA/historian.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ingestion of SCADA events, alarm journals, and historian tags
      (e.g., AVEVA PI, Canary, Aspen IP.21) via read-only connectors;
      sub-5-second end-to-end latency.
    - >-
      Cascading alarm deduplication using pipeline topology and
      sequence-of-events to group related alarms into incidents.
    - >-
      Causal reasoning: equipment- and topology-aware models (compressors,
      regulators, valves, linepack, telecom) to rank root causes with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Hybrid anomaly detection (change-point, multivariate residuals, seasonal
      baselines) to catch subtle degradations (e.g., rising compressor discharge
      temp under constant load).
    - >-
      Next Best Action recommendations mapped to operator SOPs and alarm
      rationalization notes (API 1165/1167 aligned), with clear why-explanations
      and confidence bands.
    - >-
      Context enrichment: work orders (SAP PM/Maximo), planned outages, weather
      (NOAA), power utility status, and telecom link health.
    - >-
      Operator HMI overlay/side-panel plugin for common SCADA platforms and a
      web dashboard for supervisors and compliance.
    - >-
      Alarm performance and compliance analytics (EEMUA 191/API 1167): rates,
      floods, shelving, standing alarms, operator response times; export to
      audit packages.
    - >-
      Offline training and simulation mode using historical events for
      controller drills and change management.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, advisory-only alarm triage and root-cause assistant built for
    natural gas pipelines. Consolidates floods into incidents, ranks likely
    causes with confidence, and recommends next best actions mapped to
    SOPs—within seconds. Cuts alarm noise 50–80%, reduces triage time 40–60%,
    and produces audit-ready CRM/API 1167 evidence without issuing control
    moves.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pipeline-specific causal knowledge base and topology-aware incidentization
    engine validated across multiple operators, combined with audit-ready
    CRM/API 1167 reporting. Read-only, low-latency deployment patterns
    pre-approved by common SCADA cybersecurity standards reduce procurement
    friction and time-to-value.

    Pipeline control room managers, controllers, and SCADA/reliability engineers
    who need calm, compliant, always-on natural gas pipeline operations.
  problem: >-
    External—alarm floods, telemetry dropouts, cascading events, and false
    positives obscure true issues. Internal—controllers feel overwhelmed and
    uncertain about what to act on first. Philosophical—people should make the
    decisions; machines should triage the noise and surface context.

    We understand 24/7 pipeline pressure and regulatory scrutiny. Built by
    pipeline SCADA and reliability practitioners; aligned with ISA 18.2, EEMUA
    191, and API 1167 best practices. Advisory-only—no control moves.
  plan: >-
    1) Read-only connect to SCADA/historian/alarm logs. 2) Learn patterns and
    alarm relationships. 3) Real-time triage to dedupe cascades and detect
    anomalies. 4) Suggest likely root causes and next best actions with
    evidence. 5) Operator feedback closes the loop. Guardrails: auditable,
    secure, advisory-only.

    Direct—Book a 30-minute demo or start a limited-scope pilot.
    Transitional—Get the Alarm Flood Readiness Scorecard and a sample root-cause
    report.
  success: >-
    A calm control room where critical signals stand out. Faster, confident
    responses; fewer alarm floods and callouts; reduced MTTR; audit-ready
    rationale; improved uptime and safety; easier compliance.
  failure: >-
    Noise hides real problems, causing slow responses, unplanned outages, safety
    and environmental risk, regulatory findings, controller burnout, and higher
    operating costs.
