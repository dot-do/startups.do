  risks:
    - POS data latency/incompleteness

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Trade spend lacks transparency: 20–40% of promotions underperform or
      destroy value because uplift and ROI aren’t measured consistently at
      account/SKU level.
    - >-
      Wholesalers struggle to separate true incremental volume from
      forward-buying, cannibalization, and seasonality (e.g., Halloween, Easter,
      Valentine’s) leading to misallocated budgets.
    - >-
      Display compliance and execution quality are opaque; discounts run without
      confirming that displays, secondary placements, or features were in place.
    - >-
      Pricing and promo depth decisions are often heuristic; no systematic
      next-best action by account/SKU based on elasticity and retailer
      behaviors.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (ERP invoices, EDI 852/867, DEX/scan, broker/audit reports)
      and slow to reconcile; post-event analysis arrives weeks later and misses
      re-buy windows.
    - >-
      Finance needs defensible ROI attribution to justify manufacturer co-op
      funds and negotiate better terms; current spreadsheet methods are not
      audit-ready.
    - >-
      Inventory and service levels during promos are volatile, causing
      out-of-stocks or costly carryover inventory after the event.
    - >-
      Sales teams need simple, retailer-ready promo sell sheets with evidence of
      expected incremental margin and category growth.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify data: Ingest invoices/shipments (ERP), trade deals (TPM/finance),
      promotion calendars, EDI 852 (product activity), EDI 867 (POS and product
      transfer), and any audit/compliance data.
    - >-
      Causal uplift measurement: Use hierarchical Bayesian/causal inference to
      estimate incremental units vs. baseline, separating forward-buying,
      cannibalization, halo, and seasonality effects by account/SKU/week.
    - >-
      ROI and margin attribution: Tie uplift to gross-to-net waterfall (list,
      off-invoice, billbacks, scan, display fees) to compute cost per
      incremental unit and incremental gross profit ($ and %).
    - >-
      Next-best promotion: Recommend offer depth, duration, timing, and display
      type by account/SKU, given elasticity, shopper response patterns, and
      retailer calendars.
    - >-
      Budget and calendar optimizer: Constrained optimization to allocate trade
      budget across accounts/SKUs to maximize incremental gross profit subject
      to funding and execution constraints.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: What-if analysis to test alternative depths, weeks,
      displays, and inventory plans with confidence intervals and stockout risk
      alerts.
    - >-
      Execution feedback loop: Track display compliance and on-shelf
      availability where data exists; auto-adjust expected ROI mid-promo;
      surface learnings into post-event scorecards.
    - >-
      Decision delivery: Retailer-ready sell sheets and dashboards; API/webhooks
      to push approved plans to ERP/TPM calendars and to sales enablement tools.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Measure the true incremental impact and ROI of discounts and displays at the
    account/SKU level and recommend the next-best promotion per account, so
    wholesalers shift trade dollars to high-yield events, defend co-op funding
    with evidence, and grow incremental gross profit within a single season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized uplift and optimization engine for confectionery
    wholesalers that combines seasonality-aware models, EDI 852/867 ingestion at
    scale, and anonymized benchmarks of display and discount
    effectiveness—packaged with retailer-ready evidence and ERP/TPM integrations
    to operationalize decisions.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

    must grow volume profitably across accounts, SKUs, and seasons.
  problem: >-
    Trade dollars go to TPRs, off-invoice/billbacks, and shippers, but true
    uplift and ROI by account/SKU are unclear. Fragmented EDI/syndicated data,
    forward-buying/diverting, and seasonal volatility cause wasted spend, denied

    Trade Promotion ROI Analyzer—an AI service built for candy wholesalers—turns
    shipments, pricing, and POS into trusted causal lift and ROI. Candy-specific
    seasonality modeling and proven connectors (EDI 852/867, IRI/Nielsen)
    provide clear, actionable insight.
  plan: >-
    Connect: integrate shipments, pricing, EDI 852/867, and syndicated POS.
    Diagnose: model baselines, incremental units, cannibalization, and ROI by
    account/SKU/promotion. Act: receive next-best promotion and funding
    recommendations with scenario planning and retailer-ready justification.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo; launch a 6-week pilot on two target accounts or a key
    season to validate ROI.
  success: >-
    Make every discount and shipper count. Reallocate spend to proven tactics,
    lift promo ROI, protect gross margin, and build data-backed joint business
    plans that win displays and seasonal resets.
  failure: >-
    Keep overfunding unprofitable deals, miss seasonal windows, face chargebacks
    and inventory whiplash, and cede displays and margin to competitors.

## Service Overview

PromoLift AI transforms trade promotion management for confectionery wholesalers through advanced analytics and optimization. The platform measures true incremental impact and ROI of discounts and displays at the account/SKU level, enabling data-driven decisions that maximize profitability.

### Key Capabilities

- **Causal Uplift Measurement**: Separates true incremental volume from forward-buying, cannibalization, and seasonality
- **ROI Attribution**: Ties uplift to gross-to-net waterfall for accurate cost per incremental unit calculation  
- **Next-Best Promotion Engine**: Recommends optimal offer depth, duration, timing, and display type
- **Budget Optimization**: Allocates trade spend across accounts/SKUs to maximize incremental gross profit
- **Scenario Simulation**: What-if analysis with confidence intervals and risk alerts
- **Execution Tracking**: Monitors display compliance and adjusts ROI expectations in real-time
