leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Trade spend lacks transparency: 20–40% of promotions underperform or
      destroy value because uplift and ROI aren’t measured consistently at
      account/SKU level.
    - >-
      Wholesalers struggle to separate true incremental volume from
      forward-buying, cannibalization, and seasonality (e.g., Halloween, Easter,
      Valentine’s) leading to misallocated budgets.
    - >-
      Display compliance and execution quality are opaque; discounts run without
      confirming that displays, secondary placements, or features were in place.
    - >-
      Pricing and promo depth decisions are often heuristic; no systematic
      next-best action by account/SKU based on elasticity and retailer
      behaviors.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (ERP invoices, EDI 852/867, DEX/scan, broker/audit reports)
      and slow to reconcile; post-event analysis arrives weeks later and misses
      re-buy windows.
    - >-
      Finance needs defensible ROI attribution to justify manufacturer co-op
      funds and negotiate better terms; current spreadsheet methods are not
      audit-ready.
    - >-
      Inventory and service levels during promos are volatile, causing
      out-of-stocks or costly carryover inventory after the event.
    - >-
      Sales teams need simple, retailer-ready promo sell sheets with evidence of
      expected incremental margin and category growth.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify data: Ingest invoices/shipments (ERP), trade deals (TPM/finance),
      promotion calendars, EDI 852 (product activity), EDI 867 (POS and product
      transfer), and any audit/compliance data.
    - >-
      Causal uplift measurement: Use hierarchical Bayesian/causal inference to
      estimate incremental units vs. baseline, separating forward-buying,
      cannibalization, halo, and seasonality effects by account/SKU/week.
    - >-
      ROI and margin attribution: Tie uplift to gross-to-net waterfall (list,
      off-invoice, billbacks, scan, display fees) to compute cost per
      incremental unit and incremental gross profit ($ and %).
    - >-
      Next-best promotion: Recommend offer depth, duration, timing, and display
      type by account/SKU, given elasticity, shopper response patterns, and
      retailer calendars.
    - >-
      Budget and calendar optimizer: Constrained optimization to allocate trade
      budget across accounts/SKUs to maximize incremental gross profit subject
      to funding and execution constraints.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: What-if analysis to test alternative depths, weeks,
      displays, and inventory plans with confidence intervals and stockout risk
      alerts.
    - >-
      Execution feedback loop: Track display compliance and on-shelf
      availability where data exists; auto-adjust expected ROI mid-promo;
      surface learnings into post-event scorecards.
    - >-
      Decision delivery: Retailer-ready sell sheets and dashboards; API/webhooks
      to push approved plans to ERP/TPM calendars and to sales enablement tools.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Measure the true incremental impact and ROI of discounts and displays at the
    account/SKU level and recommend the next-best promotion per account, so
    wholesalers shift trade dollars to high-yield events, defend co-op funding
    with evidence, and grow incremental gross profit within a single season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized uplift and optimization engine for confectionery
    wholesalers that combines seasonality-aware models, EDI 852/867 ingestion at
    scale, and anonymized benchmarks of display and discount
    effectiveness—packaged with retailer-ready evidence and ERP/TPM integrations
    to operationalize decisions.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
