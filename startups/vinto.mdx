leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High misfit return rates (5–15% of orders) due to incorrect part selection
      from incomplete or inconsistent fitment data
    - >-
      Parts counter associates spend 4–10 minutes per VIN/fitment inquiry,
      creating queues and lost in-store sales
    - >-
      Online shoppers abandon when asked to select trim/options; conversion
      drops when YMM selectors are confusing or inaccurate
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ACES/PIES, OEM EPCs, TSBs, and distributor
      catalogs; no single source tied to live inventory
    - >-
      Lost revenue from missed attachment items (hardware, fluids, tools) and
      poor cross-sell relevance
    - >-
      Customer service load from fitment questions via phone, chat, and email;
      inconsistent answers increase liability
    - >-
      Retailers lack confidence scoring and audit trails, making it hard to
      diagnose why misfits occur and improve
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-source VIN decoding that enriches beyond NHTSA fields using
      commercial decoders and OEM option logic to resolve trim, engine, axle,
      package codes
    - >-
      Fitment reasoning engine that unifies ACES/PIES, OEM EPC logic, TSBs, and
      historical return outcomes to generate a compatibility score with
      human-readable rationale
    - >-
      Real-time inventory and pricing integration by store/DC to only recommend
      items that are in-stock or available for rapid transfer
    - >-
      Conversational agent embedded on web, mobile, and counter terminals that
      guides shoppers or associates from VIN/photo to curated parts list
    - >-
      Add-to-cart, saved quote, and order-by-SKU outputs with webhooks to
      POS/eCommerce platforms; optionally generate pick tickets and hold orders
    - >-
      Attachment intelligence that adds required hardware/fluids and relevant
      accessories with clear why-it-fits explanations
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop escalation for low-confidence cases and a full audit
      trail for every recommendation
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard tracking fitment accuracy, conversion, attach rates,
      AHT, and ROI; with A/B testing and confidence threshold tuning
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any VIN into in-stock, compatible parts with proof-of-fit and one-click
    add-to-cart or quote—cut misfit returns by 30–50%, reduce time-to-quote by
    70%, and lift conversion 10–20%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop fitment knowledge graph continuously trained from multi-source
    catalogs, OEM references, and real return outcomes, producing explainable
    compatibility scores tied to live inventory; combined with distribution
    partnerships and deep POS/eCom integrations that are costly and
    time-consuming to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Automotive parts and accessories retailers who want every shopper and
    counter rep to instantly see which parts fit a specific vehicle.
  problem: >-
    Fitment uncertainty—manual VIN decoding, incomplete specs, and scattered

    VINs, confirms exact trims/options, and recommends in‑stock compatible parts

    Present compatible, in‑stock parts with add‑to‑cart and quote options.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or start a pilot to launch the VIN concierge across your site,
    POS, and B2B portal.
  success: >-
    Fewer returns and support tickets, faster checkout, higher conversion and
    AOV, confident buyers and counter staff, and measurable revenue from fitment
    certainty.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing and paying for it—misfit parts, mounting return costs, lost
    trust, and sales left in the cart.
