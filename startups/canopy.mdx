  problem:
    - >-
      Outbreaks of bark beetle and other forest pests are increasing in
      frequency and severity due to warming/drought, overwhelming traditional
      scouting methods.
    - >-
      Manual aerial/ground surveys are costly (>$0.50–$2.00/ha/yr),
      intermittent, and miss early-stage infestations that spread exponentially
      in 2–6 weeks.
    - >-
      Existing remote-sensing tools often flag generic “change” but lack
      actionable, stand-level pest risk attribution and create alert fatigue
      (high false-positive rates).
    - >-
      Managers lack timely, spatially precise guidance to target field checks
      and treatments (e.g., sanitation harvest, trap deployment) before
      significant mortality occurs.
    - >-
      Regulatory and certification schemes (FSC/PEFC) and insurance stakeholders
      increasingly require objective evidence of health monitoring and response,
      adding reporting burden.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly early-warning maps at 10 m (Sentinel-2) with anomaly detection on
      NDVI/EVI, red-edge, NDMI, NBR; fused with SAR (Sentinel-1) and thermal to
      reduce cloud/gap noise.
    - >-
      Eco-region-specific models that estimate pest likelihood (e.g., Ips/
      Dendroctonus bark beetle) vs. other stressors using time-series features,
      drought indices, degree-day accumulation, host species maps, and
      disturbance history.
    - >-
      Stand-level risk scoring and prioritized field tasking: auto-generate
      “check these polygons” with GPS navigation, offline maps, photo
      checklists, and sampling protocols.
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and triage to minimize false positives; alert bundling
      by stand/compartment to reduce alert fatigue.
    - >-
      Treatment decision support: estimate likely spread direction/velocity
      (wind, temperature) and recommend buffer/sanitation areas.
    - >-
      APIs and ArcGIS/Trimble integrations for seamless ingestion to existing
      planning tools, plus exportable compliance-ready reports.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop validation: incorporate field photos, pheromone trap
      data, and user feedback to continuously retrain models per client region.
    - >-
      Incident dashboards for managers: trend lines, outbreaks by stand/species,
      lead-time metrics, avoided-loss estimates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect and prioritize canopy stress and likely pest/disease hotspots 10–30
    days before visible crown discoloration, delivering stand-level,
    confidence-scored alerts and field-task lists that cut scouting costs by
    30–50% and reduce timber volume loss by 10–25%, integrated into existing
    forestry workflows (ArcGIS, Trimble Forestry).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, eco-region-labeled dataset fusing early red-edge
    stress, SAR backscatter anomalies, microclimate, and pheromone trap
    telemetry—combined with deep integrations into forestry planning tools and a
    human-in-the-loop validation network that continuously improves precision
    and lead time per customer region.

    Silviculture and forest‑health support teams serving timberland owners who
    must protect stands, budgets, and certifications.
  problem: >-
    External: Pests and disease (e.g., bark beetle) spread unnoticed across
    vast, remote stands. Internal: Crews feel reactive and unsure where to scout
    first. Philosophical: Forests deserve proactive, data‑driven care—not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Forest Health & Pest Early Warning understands the cost of late detection;
    our field‑validated AI analyzes multi‑spectral imagery to pinpoint canopy
    stress and likely hotspots, guiding targeted field checks with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your stands (upload boundaries, choose species/risks). 2) We
    monitor imagery and deliver weekly risk maps and prioritized scouting
    routes. 3) Dispatch crews, confirm hotspots, and act early—then track
    outcomes.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot on selected stands.
    Transitional: Download a sample risk map and baseline report.
  success: >-
    Detect outbreaks weeks earlier, focus crews where it matters, reduce losses
    and spray costs, protect timber value and certifications, and document
    proactive stewardship.
  failure: >-
    Remain reactive, miss early infestations, overspend on blanket surveys and
    treatments, suffer avoidable timber loss and reputational damage.
