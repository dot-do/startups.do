leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Sanctions screening generates 95–99% false positives due to fuzzy
      matching, transliteration, common-name collisions, and incomplete KYC
      context, inflating workload and costs.
    - >-
      Analysts spend 5–12 minutes per alert consolidating data across screening
      engines, KYC/CRM, core banking, and external sources; backlogs cause SLA
      breaches on customer onboarding and payments.
    - >-
      Documentation of final rulings is inconsistent and time-consuming, leading
      to repeat work, poor auditability, and regulatory exam findings (e.g.,
      NYDFS Part 504 filtering program expectations).
    - >-
      Existing screening platforms excel at detection but lack policy-aware
      disambiguation and explainable recommendations, forcing manual,
      error-prone decisions.
    - >-
      Fatigue and high volume create operational risk of missed true positives
      and inconsistent application of the OFAC 50 Percent Rule and other
      list-program nuances.
    - >-
      Compliance teams face budget pressure: typical fully loaded cost per alert
      review is $6–$12 and rising with volumes and list complexity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-disruptive overlay: ingest alerts from existing screening tools (e.g.,
      Fircosoft, Actimize, Bridger, Oracle) via connectors or flat-file/API;
      push outcomes back to current case managers.
    - >-
      Entity resolution and policy-aware scoring: combine name-similarity,
      aliases/transliterations, geo/program context, KYC attributes, and
      corporate ownership (OFAC 50 Percent Rule) to recommend disposition with
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Analyst co-pilot: LLM drafts final ruling notes with citations (fields,
      lists, ownership docs) mapped to internal policies; configurable templates
      ensure consistency.
    - >-
      Auto-triage: safe auto-closure of low-risk matches under strict thresholds
      and human-in-the-loop guardrails; queue prioritization for likely true
      positives.
    - >-
      Governance and audit: versioned policies, decision logs, rationale
      traceability, challenger models, and validation reports suitable for
      internal audit/regulators.
    - >-
      Deployment options: SOC 2-ready SaaS in customer-dedicated VPC or
      on-premises containerized deployment; PII-minimizing data flows and
      configurable retention.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut false-positive workload by 50–70% and average handling time by 60% while
    producing regulator-ready, evidence-cited disposition notes—without
    replacing your existing screening engine.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compounding proprietary corpus of regulator-accepted, evidence-cited
    disposition notes and labeled alerts; deep, pre-built connectors to dominant
    screening engines; policy-aware explainability designed with ex-OFAC/BSA
    officers; on-prem/VPC deployment with PII-minimization enabling adoption by
    risk-averse institutions.
