  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, error-prone quoting: Many 321999 shops take 1–5 days to turn custom
      requests into quotes because engineers must manually draft, calculate
      BOMs, and price.
    - >-
      Engineering bottlenecks: Sales hands off napkin sketches; engineering
      rebuilds models, causing double work and rework when options change.
    - >-
      Inconsistent BOMs and cutlists: Spreadsheet-driven methods lead to missed
      fasteners, wrong board feet, and cutlist errors that show up on the floor.
    - >-
      Volatile material costs: Prices for plywood/MDF/solid wood change
      frequently; updating pricing sheets is manual and lagging, which erodes
      margins.
    - >-
      Poor yield and high scrap: Non-optimized cutting/nesting wastes 1–5% of
      material; savings are invisible and unmeasured.
    - >-
      Lack of web configurators: Distributors/dealers can’t self-serve;
      customers must email or call, hurting conversion and perceived
      responsiveness.
    - >-
      Disconnected systems: CAD/CAM, ERP/accounting, and e-commerce aren’t
      integrated; data entry is duplicated, causing mistakes and delays.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: Owners can’t see quote cycle time, conversion rates,
      yield, or labor saved; decisions are gut-feel rather than data-driven.
  solution:
    - >-
      Configurable product templates for frames, shelving, fixtures, and panels
      with parametric rules (thickness, joinery, hardware).
    - >-
      Instant BOM and cutlist generation with yield-optimized layouts; export
      CSV/DXF/labels; optional G-code via partner post-processors.
    - >-
      Rule-based pricing engine with material index updates, labor routing,
      overhead, and margin controls; multi-currency/tax support.
    - >-
      3D web viewer (WebGL) with live dimensioning; shareable links, AR-ready
      images for e-commerce product pages.
    - >-
      Dealer/customer portal and embeddable widget; role-based access; approval
      workflows; quote-to-order handoff.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP/accounting (QuickBooks, NetSuite, Odoo), e-commerce
      (Shopify/BigCommerce), nesting/CAM (OptiCut, Cut Rite, SigmaNEST).
    - >-
      DFM checks (min stile/rail widths, fastener spacing, max span) with
      instant rule feedback to prevent unbuildable designs.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: quote cycle time, win rate, margin leakage, yield %,
      scrap, throughput; per-product and per-dealer KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Web-native configurator that turns custom sizes/options into an instant BOM,
    cutlist, optimized material plan, CNC-ready files, and price—reducing quote
    time from days to minutes, improving material yield by 1.5–3%, and
    increasing quote-to-order conversion by 5–15%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific rule library and templates for wood products that produce
    CNC-ready outputs instantly, combined with OEM/VAR partnerships and
    anonymized benchmarking data that improve yields and pricing accuracy over
    time—hard for generic CPQ or CAD vendors to replicate.
