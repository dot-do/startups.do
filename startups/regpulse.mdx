leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Regulatory changes are frequent, fragmented, multilingual, and issued by
      ministries, customs authorities, health agencies, and standards
      bodies—manual monitoring misses or delays updates (weeks to months).
    - >-
      Manufacturers manage thousands of SKUs across 100+ markets; mapping a
      change (e.g., new health warning size or flavor restriction) to specific
      SKUs, components, and bills of materials is slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Packaging, labeling, and track-and-trace rules vary by market (e.g., plain
      packaging, pictorial warnings, excise stamp placement) and change
      timelines—late compliance causes write-offs, fines, import holds, and lost
      shelf time.
    - >-
      Next-generation products (heated tobacco, e-cigarettes) face faster-moving
      rules (e.g., nicotine limits, device standards) that outpace in-house
      teams’ capacity to interpret and operationalize.
    - >-
      Lack of structured audit trail from “change detected” to “SKU updated”
      makes proving due diligence to regulators and auditors difficult.
    - >-
      Existing tools provide regulatory news feeds but not SKU-level impact
      analysis, tasking, or integrations with PLM/ERP/labeling systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously crawl and subscribe to official sources (health ministries,
      gazettes, customs, standards bodies, tax authorities, FCTC, TPD/FDA
      updates) across 190+ jurisdictions; normalize and translate with ML +
      human-in-the-loop.
    - >-
      Classify each change by product category (cigarettes, cigar, smokeless,
      HTP, e-cig), topic (packaging, ingredients, emissions, advertising, T&T,
      excise), and effective/transition dates.
    - >-
      Map obligations to a proprietary tobacco regulation ontology, then to
      customer-specific SKU master (brand, variant, pack size, materials,
      warning panels, inks, foils, T&T identifiers) to produce SKU-level impact
      diffs.
    - >-
      Auto-generate tasks and change requests (e.g., update front warning to
      65%, add local quitline text, remove characterizing flavor descriptor)
      with due dates, owners, and dependencies.
    - >-
      Integrate with PLM/ERP/Labeling (SAP S/4HANA, SAP PLM, Oracle Agile PLM,
      Esko, Loftware/NiceLabel) to push change orders, label components, and BOM
      updates.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards: heatmaps of regulatory exposure by market/SKU,
      countdowns to compliance, inventory burn-down simulation, and packaging
      change critical path.
    - >-
      Maintain an auditable chain: source document, machine extraction, SME
      validation, decision log, and implementation evidence.
    - >-
      Offer scenario planning: simulate pending proposals’ impact on current and
      pipeline SKUs; recommend least-cost compliance options based on
      constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From regulation to action in hours: near-real-time global monitoring
    translated into verified obligations and executable tasks per SKU/market,
    integrated with PLM/ERP/labeling to cut compliance lead time and risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Regulatory, compliance, and product/packaging leaders at global tobacco
    manufacturers who must keep every SKU compliant in each market—on time and
    audit-ready.
  problem: >-
    External: A constantly shifting, fragmented web of global tobacco laws,
    languages, and deadlines per market/SKU.

    Internal: Teams are overwhelmed by manual tracking, conflicting
    interpretations, and late surprises.

    Philosophical: Compliance shouldn’t be guesswork—when rules change, the
    business should know exactly who must do what, by when.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure of proving compliance across thousands
    of SKUs and jurisdictions with zero tolerance for errors.

    Authority: Our AI monitors verified global sources, normalizes changes, and
    outputs traceable citations and impact logic trusted by enterprise
    compliance teams.
  plan: >-
    Simple 3-step plan:

    1) Connect your SKU catalog, markets, and policies; enable integrations
    (PLM/QMS/ERP).

    2) The AI continuously monitors global changes and translates them into
    obligations, owners, and dated tasks per SKU/market with citations.

    3) Review, approve, and push tasks into your workflows; track status,
    evidence, and audits from one dashboard.
