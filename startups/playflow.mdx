  problem:
    - >-
      High exception rates across 850/855/856/810 increase manual touches and
      delays (typical 15–30% of documents require intervention, adding 5–20
      minutes each).
    - >-
      Retailer compliance penalties and chargebacks (often 1–3% of invoice
      value) from late/invalid ASNs, incorrect UCC-128/GS1-128 labels, and
      item/pack mismatches.
    - >-
      Extended DSO due to invoice rejects or mismatched acknowledgments; 3–7
      extra days is common when 855/856 don’t align to 850/shipments.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack: EDI translator, label software, and ERP are
      disconnected; staff swivel-chair between portals, email, and ERP, leading
      to errors and slow response.
    - >-
      Slow trading partner onboarding (2–8 weeks per partner) and recurring
      mapping edits for retailer updates consume IT/ops capacity.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: operations cannot quickly see root cause of exceptions
      or know which orders risk missing retailer ship windows.
    - >-
      Labor constraints and seasonality (Q3–Q4 spikes 2–4x) overwhelm teams;
      temp labor is costly and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Prebuilt, retailer-validated 850/855/856/810 flows with configurable
      business rules mapped to toy/hobby use-cases (kits, assortments, seasonal
      packs).
    - >-
      Native ERP connectors (NetSuite, Acumatica, MS Dynamics 365 BC/Finance,
      Sage, Epicor P21) for PO creation, SO updates, shipment confirmation, and
      invoicing.
    - >-
      Label automation: generate GS1-128/UCC-128 shipping labels and packing
      slips aligned to each retailer’s routing guide; auto-attach SSCC to ASN.
    - >-
      AI exception console: correlates 850→855→856→810, highlights mismatches,
      explains cause in human-friendly terms, and recommends fixes with
      one-click apply to ERP/EDI.
    - >-
      Compliance engine: rule packs for major retailers (Target, Walmart, Amazon
      Vendor Central, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Five Below, Joann, Barnes & Noble,
      Costco) with ongoing updates.
    - >-
      Onboarding accelerator: trading-partner templates and test harness;
      typical partner go-live target 5–10 business days.
    - >-
      Seasonal scaling: elastic document throughput and label generation;
      proactive alerts on cutoff risks and late-window orders.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase straight-through EDI Order-to-Cash to 85%+ and cut chargebacks 50%
    by unifying 850/855/856/810 automation, ERP posting, compliant label
    generation, and AI-driven exception explanations that anyone can act on—no
    EDI jargon required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned AI that correlates 850→855→856→810 and explains exceptions in
    plain language with actionable, one-click fixes mapped to ERP/EDI
    fields—backed by a maintained library of toy/hobby retailer rule packs and
    pre-certified maps that materially cut onboarding time and chargebacks.

  character: >-
    Operations/EDI leader at a Toy & Hobby Goods wholesaler who must ship on
    time, stay retailer‑compliant, and accelerate cash—without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    Retailers demand flawless EDI (850/855/856/810). Manual portals, fragile
    maps, and label hassles create late ASNs, chargebacks, and cash
    delays—especially during seasonal spikes and when handling kits/pre‑packs.
    EDI should just work and explain itself.
  guide: >-
    We understand toy/hobby compliance and peak‑season pressure. Our AI EDI
    service automates 850→855→856→810, posts to your ERP, generates

    English. Prebuilt maps for Walmart, Target, Amazon Vendor, Michaels, Hobby
    Lobby, and more; secure AS2/SFTP; SOC‑ready.

    maps, packs/kits, and labels; pilot with one retailer. 3) Go live with
    dashboards and exception summaries; expand trading partners.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20‑minute fit call to see your flows automated. Or request a sample
    exception report.

    Touchless order‑to‑cash: auto‑acknowledged POs, on‑time ASNs, compliant
    labels, clean invoices, and faster cash. Chargebacks drop, team time
    returns, and you scale Q4 without extra hires.
  failure: >-
    Stay stuck in portals and spreadsheets, keep paying chargebacks, miss ASNs,
    scramble during peaks, and strain retailer relationships while cash slows.
