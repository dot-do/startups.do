  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual QC for textile bags and canvas products is subjective and
      inconsistent across inspectors and shifts, leading to variable quality and
      customer complaints.
    - >-
      Critical defects (missed stitches, open seams, mis-set grommets, skewed
      prints, off-dimension cuts) often escape sampling-based inspections and
      are discovered late (post-pack or by customers).
    - >-
      Traditional machine vision systems are high capex and hard to retrofit on
      sewing, grommeting, and screen/heat-transfer printing lines with frequent
      SKU changeovers.
    - >-
      QC documentation is slow and error-prone; compiling AQL/ISO-compliant
      reports, photo evidence, and traceability per lot or PO often delays
      shipments.
    - >-
      Training new inspectors on defect taxonomies and tolerances per SKU is
      time-consuming; high turnover in QC roles increases ramp time and
      inconsistency.
    - >-
      Brands and retailers increasingly demand digital QC evidence and supplier
      scorecards; many mills lack structured, searchable QC data.
    - >-
      Dimension checks with tape/ruler are slow and inaccurate, especially for
      large canvas items; operators skip or rush measurements under schedule
      pressure.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided mobile app (Android/iOS) with SKU-specific checklists for seams,
      grommets, printing, and dimensions; dynamic prompts ensure necessary
      angles and views are captured.
    - >-
      Calibration kit: lightweight magnetic board or mat with fiducial markers
      (ArUco) enabling accurate dimensioning (±2–3 mm on items up to 1.2 m with
      a single shot; larger items via multi-tile stitching).
    - >-
      On-device pre-check (blur, lighting, framing) to reduce unusable images;
      real-time feedback to operator to recapture before submission.
    - >-
      Cloud inference models specialized for textile defects: seam continuity,
      stitch density and zigzag consistency, over/under-trim, grommet
      position/ovalization, print registration/skew, logo placement, color
      deviation (ΔE2000), panel size variance.
    - >-
      Immediate pass/fail with defect type, severity, and location overlays;
      configurable tolerances per SKU (e.g., print offset ≤ ±3 mm; grommet
      center offset ≤ 2 mm; seam width ±1.5 mm).
    - >-
      Automated AQL sampling and reporting (ISO 2859-1 / ANSI/ASQ Z1.4); per-lot
      inspection plans, accept/reject decisions, and photo-backed PDF/CSV
      reports.
    - >-
      Operations dashboard: line/shift-level defect trends, top defect causes,
      FPY, rework rates, and supplier/PO scorecards; export to ERP/MES.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations (e.g., NetSuite, Infor, SAP B1) to fetch POs/SKUs
      and post inspection results; webhooks for hold/release and NCR workflows.
    - >-
      Multilingual UI (EN, ZH, VI, BN, TR) and SOP templates; role-based access
      controls for inspectors, supervisors, and brand auditors.
    - >-
      Offline mode with store-and-forward for limited connectivity shops; local
      encryption and privacy controls for brand artwork.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Smartphone photo inspection that catches textile-specific defects and
    measures dimensions within seconds, auto-generates AQL-compliant QC reports,
    and deploys in a day—no fixed cameras or line changes required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific defect dataset and measurement pipeline optimized for
    textile bags/canvas, paired with AQL automation and smartphone-only
    deployment, enabling fast ROI without capex—difficult for generic vision
    vendors and inspection agencies to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    QC supervisors and production managers at textile bag and canvas mills who
    must ship flawless seams, grommets, prints, and dimensions on time and on
    margin.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual checks miss seam skips, mis-set grommets, off-register
    prints, and out-of-tolerance sizes; reporting is slow and inconsistent.
    Internal: Pressure from tight deadlines and brand audits with variable
    inspector skill by shift. Philosophical: Quality shouldn’t depend on one
    pair of eyes or a clipboard.
  guide: >-
    We understand factory-floor realities—lint, humidity, moving lines, and
    tight margins. Our purpose-built computer vision for textile bags and canvas
    flags defects and compiles audit-ready QC reports, giving you consistent,
    traceable quality data.
  plan: >-
    1) Snap: Use any smartphone to capture seams, grommets, prints, and
    tape-measured dimensions. 2) Check: AI flags defects by type/severity and
    tolerance, with fix suggestions. 3) Report: One-tap lot/PO QC report; export
    to PDF/CSV/ERP. Start with a 2-week pilot on one line—no hardware required.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute pilot setup. Transitional: Download a sample QC
    report and defect checklist.
  success: >-
    Faster, consistent inspections across shifts; fewer defects shipped; reduced
    rework and chargebacks; audit-ready traceability; higher throughput and
    stronger customer trust.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing subjective checks, late-found defects, costly rework, missed ship
    dates, failed audits, lost contracts, and eroded brand reputation.
