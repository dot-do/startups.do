  problem:
    - >-
      Raw materials are 60–80% of feed COGS; commodity price volatility (corn,
      SBM, wheat, oils) compresses margins when formulas aren’t refreshed
      frequently.
    - >-
      Formulators re-optimize weekly or monthly due to manual workflows; missed
      re-optimization windows lose 1–3% savings per ton.
    - >-
      Existing tools are desktop or semi-integrated; they lack real-time price
      feeds, inventory awareness, and plant-specific manufacturing constraints,
      causing infeasible or suboptimal formulas.
    - >-
      Regulatory and customer-spec compliance (AAFCO, EU 767/2009, label
      guarantees) require rigorous auditing; manual checks add delays and risk.
    - >-
      Multi-plant operations suffer spec drift and inconsistent formulations
      across sites; aligning pricing and constraints at scale is hard.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced nutritionists/formulators increases workload and
      risk of errors; onboarding new staff takes months.
    - >-
      Aquaculture and specialty diets have complex, nonlinear constraints (e.g.,
      digestible amino acids, anti-nutritional factors, palatability) that
      generic LP tools don’t capture.
  solution:
    - >-
      Event-driven optimization: auto-recalculate formulas when price feeds,
      inventory, or spec changes cross thresholds (e.g., >0.75% price move on
      key inputs).
    - >-
      LP/MILP optimization engine with nutrition-aware constraints
      (species/stage-specific digestible amino acids, energy systems, fiber
      fractions, mineral bioavailability, anti-nutritional factors).
    - >-
      Inventory- and plant-aware formulation: blend limits, pellet/expander
      constraints, moisture/steam, throughput caps, micro-dosing capabilities,
      premix availability.
    - >-
      Price data integration and forecasting: ingest real-time/near-real-time
      quotes, basis, freight; short-term forecasting to guide hedging and
      sensitivity analysis.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: run hundreds of “what-if” formulations across price
      decks, spec targets, and additive inclusion strategies; surface savings
      curves and risk trade-offs.
    - >-
      Quality/regulatory guardrails: AAFCO/EU labeling checks, customer contract
      spec compliance, max residue/mycotoxin risk limits, audit trails and
      e-sign-offs.
    - >-
      Multi-plant governance: global templates with local overrides; ensure spec
      alignment and cost normalization across sites.
    - >-
      APIs to ERP/MES/batching: push approved formulas and receive back
      consumption, QA results, and production exceptions to close the loop.
    - >-
      Explainable outputs: shadow prices, binding constraints, cost
      contributions, and sensitivity ranges that nutritionists trust.
    - >-
      Secure cloud with optional on-prem/edge agent for mills with strict IT
      policies; SOC 2 roadmap and role-based access control.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously least-cost and compliance-safe feed formulations that
    re-optimize within minutes of market moves, aligned with plant constraints
    and inventory, delivering 1–3% ingredient cost savings and 50–70% faster
    formulation cycles.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Event-driven, inventory- and plant-aware re-optimization with
    explainability, backed by proprietary short-term price forecasts and a
    curated nutrient matrix; accumulating performance benchmarks create
    switching costs and trusted ROI proofs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Feed manufacturers—plant managers, nutritionists, and planners—who must meet
    precise nutrient specs at the lowest possible cost across livestock,
    poultry, aquaculture, equine, and specialty feeds.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile ingredient markets, supply shocks, and changing
    regulatory or customer specs. Internal: manual spreadsheets/LP tools are
    slow, siloed, and error-prone; reformulations take hours and miss savings.
    Philosophical: teams should spend time on nutrition strategy, not chasing
    prices and constraints.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit specs, margins, and schedules. Our
    AI-driven least-cost formulation and re-optimization service blends
    nutrition science with modern optimization and data engineering, syncing
    prices, specs, and constraints so your formulas stay current.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: prices, nutrient matrices, constraints, inventory, and
    demand via API or CSV. 2) Configure species programs, targets, exclusions,
    and compliance rules. 3) Run continuous optimization; review exceptions;
    approve and export formulations to ERP/MES.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot with your data.
  success: >-
    Lower cost per ton, faster turnarounds, higher and more predictable margins,
    compliant formulations, fewer stockouts and reformulation fire drills, and a
    team freed to focus on product quality and innovation.
  failure: >-
    Keep overpaying for ingredients, missing savings, risking spec drift or
    non-compliance, reacting slowly to market swings, and burning time on manual
    rework.
