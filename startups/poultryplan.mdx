leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Demand volatility at SKU-week level leads to 3–8% spoilage/shrink for
      fresh poultry and 1–3% for frozen due to short shelf life and inaccurate
      forecasts.
    - >-
      Price swings (often ±10–30% month-to-month on key cuts) are not embedded
      into buy decisions, causing purchase price variance and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Manual planning (spreadsheets/ERP extracts) does not enforce vendor
      constraints (lead times, MOQs, truck/pallet mix, catch-weight), resulting
      in stockouts (service level gaps of 2–6 pts) or excess inventory.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to promotions, seasonality (e.g., wings pre-Super
      Bowl), weather, holidays, and foodservice calendar introduces forecast
      bias and reactive buying.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (EDI, ERP, WMS, spreadsheets, Urner Barry/USDA price
      feeds) prevents timely buy plans; planners spend 8–15 hours/week on data
      wrangling instead of analysis.
    - >-
      Working capital is tied up: 10–25% more inventory than needed; days
      inventory outstanding (DIO) 5–10 days above optimal.
    - >-
      Expedited freight and split-load penalties rise 10–20% due to last-minute
      purchases and missed MOQs/lead times.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and harmonization from ERP/WMS/EDI (orders, shipments,
      on-hand, open POs, vendor lead times/MOQs, pack sizes, catch-weight, shelf
      life).
    - >-
      SKU-week demand forecasting blending time-series, seasonality/holiday
      effects, promotions, price elasticity, and exogenous factors (weather,
      school calendars, sports events).
    - >-
      Commodity price-aware buying: integrate market price feeds and supplier
      quotes; simulate buy timing across lead times to balance price risk and
      service.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware buy recommendation engine: respects lead times, MOQs,
      truck/pallet optimization, vendor calendars, lot/batch and shelf-life
      constraints, substitutions/grades.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: promotions, price changes, supplier delays, influenza
      supply shocks; scenario comparison with margin and service impact.
    - >-
      Automated PO suggestions with approval workflows; ERP/EDI write-back via
      API.
    - >-
      Dashboards: forecast accuracy (MAPE/WAPE/bias), service level/fill rate,
      spoilage, inventory turns/DIO, PPV, margin per lb, expedite costs, planner
      productivity.
    - >-
      Change management: 8–12 week pilot, KPI baselines, user training, S&OP
      cadence templates tailored to poultry.

  character: >-
    Poultry & poultry-product merchant wholesalers—buyers, planners, and ops
    leaders who must decide each week what to order at the customer/SKU level to
    hit service levels without overbuying perishable inventory.
  problem: >-
    external: Volatile demand, short shelf life, vendor lead times/MOQs, and
    fast-moving market prices make SKU-week buying risky and complex.

    internal: Teams juggle spreadsheets, chase data, fear stockouts and
    spoilage, and lack confidence in the weekly buy.

    philosophical: Keeping customers supplied with fresh product at fair margins
    shouldn’t require guesswork.
  guide: >-
    empathy: We know one bad perishable buy hurts margins, cash, and
    relationships.

    authority: Built by supply-chain and poultry pricing veterans; AI forecasts
    at SKU-week granularity; buy plans that honor lead times, MOQs, shelf-life,
    and price swings; transparent assumptions and audit trails.
  plan: >-
    process: 1) Connect sales/ERP/vendor/pricing data. 2) Configure
    constraints—lead times, MOQs, shelf-life, service targets, customer rules.
    3) Review weekly SKU-level forecasts and buy recommendations (with price
    scenarios), approve/override, push POs.

    agreement: Pilot in a sandbox with your data; clear ROI tracking;
    human-in-the-loop overrides; security-first; no long-term lock-in.
  callToAction: >-
    direct: Schedule a demo or start a 4-week pilot with your data.

    transitional: Download the SKU-week Forecasting Playbook and sample accuracy
    report.
  success: >-
    Hit target fill rates with less waste; fewer rush buys; buy smart against
    price swings; free cash from slow movers; steadier vendor relations;
    planners trust the weekly cadence and focus on exceptions.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing in spreadsheets; miss service levels; overbuy perishables and
    write off product; pay peak prices in panic; tie up cash; erode margins and
    risk losing key accounts.
