  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on cigarette making/packing lines (Hauni, G.D., Focke)
      causes 8–18% OEE loss; root causes are multi-factor (material humidity,
      web tension, glue, filters) and under-diagnosed.
    - >-
      Manual reason codes and shift logs are inaccurate or incomplete (30–50%
      “unknown/other”), limiting continuous improvement impact.
    - >-
      Current OEE/MES tools report losses but don’t explain why or prescribe
      fixes; engineers spend 6–12 hours/week per line on ad-hoc analysis.
    - >-
      Siloed OT/IT data (PLC/SCADA, PI historian, MES, CMMS, quality lab,
      environmental sensors) prevents fast, holistic root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Operator turnover causes loss of tribal knowledge; new teams repeat the
      same stoppage patterns, hurting changeover and stabilization times.
    - >-
      OEM analytics are machine-specific and don’t correlate cross-line factors
      (material batch, shift, SKU, ambient), missing systemic issues.
    - >-
      Regulatory and customer audits require traceable, data-backed corrective
      actions for quality-related downtime; current evidence trails are weak.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge data agent connects to PLC/SCADA (OPC UA), historian (AVEVA PI),
      MES/MOM, CMMS, quality LIMS, and environmental sensors
      (humidity/temperature) in under 2 weeks.
    - >-
      Automated event detection and standardized tobacco downtime taxonomy
      (wrapper breaks, splice fails, filter rod breaks, glue jams, vacuum
      faults, cutting/knives, tipping, cartoner jams).
    - >-
      Root-cause engine combining time-series anomaly detection, causal graphs,
      and SHAP explanations correlating stoppages with material lots, SKUs,
      operators, shifts, setpoints, ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks with confidence and expected impact (e.g.,
      “Increase web tension by 0.2 N; expected -22% wrapper breaks this SKU; 80%
      confidence”).
    - >-
      Closed-loop actions: one-click creation of CMMS work orders, changeover
      checklists, and SPC checks; A/B testing of interventions.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot: natural-language explanations, photo/video guidance
      from best-performing lines, and multilingual support.
    - >-
      Daily/weekly CI reports, OEE waterfalls, and ROI tracking; API to push
      insights into MES/MOM and BI tools.

  problem:
    - >-
      True root causes of micro-stops and speed losses are hidden across lines
      and shifts
    - Manual downtime codes are inconsistent; operators don’t capture nuance
