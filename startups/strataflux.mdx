  problem:
    - >-
      Turnaround times are slow (4–8 weeks typical) due to manual workflows;
      exploration teams need map-ready products in <1–2 weeks to drive drilling
      decisions
    - >-
      Leveling and micro-leveling quality varies; tie-line residuals >1–2 nT and
      radiometric striping/cross-over errors >2–3% lead to rework, re-flies, and
      incorrect structural interpretation
    - >-
      UAV-specific issues (low altitude, high gradients, variable speed, small
      loops) are under-addressed by legacy pipelines designed for crewed
      aircraft
    - >-
      Shortage of senior geophysicists; operators waste time on routine
      corrections, QC, and deliverable packaging instead of interpretation
    - >-
      Data handoffs are fragmented; lack of standardized, API-driven delivery
      increases project management overhead and error risk
  solution:
    - >-
      End-to-end pipeline from raw line data to map-ready products: ingestion,
      waveform/lag corrections, diurnal/base station removal, IGRF correction,
      heading/lag compensation, tie-line leveling, ML-assisted micro-leveling,
      radiometric corrections (cosmic/aircraft background, radon/atmospherics,
      altitude, stripping), and derivative products
    - >-
      UAV-aware corrections: speed normalization, altitude/drape correction,
      platform interference modeling, terrain/flight geometry compensation
    - >-
      Automated QC: cross-over analysis, tie-line residual minimization,
      striping detection, spectral diagnostics, powerline/noise suppression,
      with QC dashboards and acceptance thresholds
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review by senior geophysicists; annotated QC reports
      with recommended re-fly segments if needed
    - >-
      Self-serve portal and API: upload raw data, monitor processing, review QC,
      download grids/GeoTIFFs/XYZ, and request additional derivatives/inversions
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-accelerated, UAV-aware mag/rad processing and leveling with guaranteed QC
    metrics and fast turnaround: map-ready grids in 72 hours for typical UAV
    surveys, tie-line residual RMS <0.5 nT (magnetics) and cross-line
    normalization error <1% (radiometrics), delivered through a secure
    API/portal with human-in-the-loop verification.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    UAV-optimized micro-leveling and QC models trained on a large,
    sensor-diverse corpus with ground-truth tie-line residuals, enabling
    guaranteed QC thresholds and 72-hour TAT at scale; integrated real-time QC
    feedback reduces re-flies and costs for operators—capabilities not easily
    replicated by generalist consultancies or legacy software-only workflows.
