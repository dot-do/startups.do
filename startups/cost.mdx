  problem:
    - >-
      Job costs overrun by 3–8% on average due to late visibility of
      labor/material variances; PMs often see issues 2–4 weeks after month-end
      close.
    - >-
      Manual invoice and timesheet entry consumes 10–20 hours per week per
      PM/accountant, with 1–2% error rates causing mis-coded costs.
    - >-
      Lack of real-time Estimate-at-Completion (EAC) forecasting leads to margin
      fade of 1–3 pts by project close.
    - >-
      Change orders and scope creep are not connected to cost codes quickly;
      unbilled change orders average 0.5–1.5% of contract value.
    - >-
      WIP schedules take 1–3 days to prepare monthly; inaccuracies increase
      bonding and lender scrutiny.
    - >-
      Field productivity (man-hours per 1,000 sq ft) is not tied to cost
      variance; crews lack feedback loops to correct course.
    - >-
      Duplicate/bad invoices (price creep, mismatched quantities) slip through
      AP, costing $200–$1,000 per month per firm.
    - >-
      Data silos across QuickBooks/Sage, Procore/Buildertrend, and timesheets
      prevent timely, job-level insights.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion via email, EDI, and API from suppliers,
      payroll/timesheets, ERPs, and PM tools.
    - >-
      AI-powered document understanding to code invoices and timesheets to jobs,
      cost codes, and cost types with high accuracy.
    - >-
      Continuous EAC/MAC (margin-at-completion) forecasting and variance alerts
      at job, phase, and cost-code levels.
    - >-
      Change-order detection and price/quantity validation against POs and
      quoted rates.
    - One-click WIP schedule generation and export to Excel/CSV and ERP.
    - >-
      Field productivity scoreboard tying labor units (e.g., man-hours per 1,000
      sq ft) to budgeted units and earned value.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time job cost variance and margin-at-completion alerts for Div 9
    trades—auto-ingesting invoices, timesheets, and budgets with minimal
    setup—so PMs correct overruns weeks earlier and protect 2–4 margin points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical focus on Div 9 trades with proprietary labeled data from major
    drywall/insulation suppliers and cost-code mappings, yielding higher
    auto-coding accuracy and faster time-to-value than horizontal tools; early
    distributor/CPA partnerships and integration certifications create
    defensible switching costs and preferred-vendor positioning.
