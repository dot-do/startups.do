  problem:
    - >-
      Rice procurement, subsidy disbursement, and insurance rely on
      self-reported or manual measurements that are often off by 5–20%, causing
      financial leakage and disputes.
    - >-
      Smallholder paddy plots (0.1–1.0 ha) are hard to delineate with optical
      imagery during monsoon due to cloud cover; field teams are expensive and
      slow.
    - >-
      Banks and insurers need fast, auditable crop confirmation to underwrite
      loans and index insurance but lack reliable, scalable methods for
      rice-specific identification.
    - >-
      Government and development programs need district- and scheme-level area
      statistics within 1–2 weeks of sowing/harvest to plan procurement and
      water allocation; current updates lag by 30–60 days.
    - >-
      Rice mills and traders face supply forecasting uncertainty (±15–25%)
      without timely, geo-referenced area maps, increasing working capital and
      logistics costs.
    - >-
      Sustainability reporting (e.g., SRP, methane reduction pilots, MRV) needs
      verified rice area and seasonality at field-level; most tools are
      generalized and not audit-ready.
    - >-
      Fragmented land records and boundary disputes require unbiased,
      time-stamped area certificates acceptable to multiple stakeholders.
    - >-
      Existing generalist crop-monitoring tools underperform for rice phenology
      in flooded conditions and multi-cropping geographies, leading to false
      positives and missed fields.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse Sentinel-1 SAR (6–12 day cadence) with Sentinel-2/PlanetScope optical
      to detect rice-specific flooding/transplanting, tillering, and harvest
      signatures.
    - >-
      Automated field boundary extraction optimized for smallholder mosaics,
      refined by super-resolution and edge-snapping to irrigation features, with
      topology checks.
    - >-
      Rice vs non-rice classification using multi-temporal phenology models and
      region-calibrated thresholds, plus confidence scoring per field.
    - >-
      Produce per-field shapefiles, area certificates (timestamped, model+scene
      lineage), and district roll-ups; expose via web dashboard and REST API.
    - >-
      Gap-fill heavy cloud periods with SAR time series and cross-scene
      mosaicking; backfill optical details when clear sky returns.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA on a smart sample (1–3% of fields) to validate and
      calibrate models; continuous benchmarking to audited ground truth.
    - >-
      Integrate with client systems (procurement apps, insurance platforms) via
      APIs and scheduled S3/GeoPackage exports.
    - >-
      Offer service tiers: Verify (rice-only), Boundaries (area + certificate),
      Pro (SAR+optical, weekly updates, SLA).

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rice farm managers, co-ops, and planners who need precise paddy boundaries
    and verified rice area without field crews.
  problem: >-
    Manual surveys and outdated maps are slow, inconsistent, and hard to
    audit—causing planning errors, acreage disputes, and wasted inputs.
  guide: >-
    We combine satellite imagery, rice-specific AI, and agronomy support to
    deliver defensible, up-to-date maps—because accurate area should be simple
    and trusted.
  plan: >-
    1) Share farm list or area-of-interest. 2) We delineate paddy fields and
    confirm rice crop from recent satellite scenes; you review online. 3) Export
    audited areas (shapefiles/CSV) into planning, subsidy, or insurance
    workflows; optional seasonal updates.
  callToAction: Book a 15‑minute demo or start a pilot in your region.
  success: >-
    Confident, auditable acreage; fewer field visits; optimized water and
    inputs; fair payments and insurance; on-time reporting and smoother
    operations.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams keep guessing acreage, face disputes and compliance
    risk, misallocate inputs and water, and lose time on repeat field checks.

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Inconsistent field areas lead to planning and payout errors.
    - 'Walking fields with GPS is slow, costly, and risky in wet seasons.'
    - Clouds and seasonal changes make manual mapping unreliable.
    - Hard to verify if a field actually contains rice this season.

    - Fragmented smallholder plots are difficult to manage at scale.
  solution:
    - AI draws precise paddy field boundaries from satellite imagery.
    - Rice crop presence is confirmed per season using time‑series data.
    - Accurate area is computed and validated with confidence scores.
    - 'Bulk mapping across villages, blocks, and districts—fully remote.'
    - 'Simple dashboard, API, and GIS exports for fast operations.'
    - Change tracking across seasons for monitoring and audits.
  features:
    - Rice‑specific model tuned to paddy phenology (optical + SAR).
    - Season‑by‑season rice confirmation with confidence scoring.
    - Boundary refinement that snaps to bunds and water edges where visible.
    - Cloud‑resilient processing with gap‑filling from multi‑date imagery.
    - Overlap and duplicate detection to reduce double‑counting.
    - 'Bulk upload: CSV/KML/GeoJSON; batch processing at scale.'
