  problem:
    - >-
      Publishers must assess similarity and clearance risk for thousands of new
      compositions monthly, but manual review by A&R/legal/musicologists is slow
      (days-weeks) and costly ($1k–$10k per deep review).
    - >-
      Existing audio ID tools focus on exact/near-exact matches (fingerprinting)
      rather than melodic/harmonic/lyrical similarity relevant to infringement
      risk.
    - >-
      Lyric checks are often keyword-based or manual Google searches, missing
      paraphrases, translations, and semantic similarities.
    - >-
      There is no standardized, audit-ready trail explaining why a work was
      flagged, weakening internal decisions and external defensibility.
    - >-
      High false positives overwhelm teams, while false negatives create
      downstream litigation risk and insurer scrutiny.
    - >-
      Workflows are fragmented across CMS/RMS tools (Synchtank/Vistex/custom),
      email, and spreadsheets; batch processing and API-first scans are lacking.
    - >-
      Global rights contexts differ; publishers need jurisdiction-aware risk
      indicators (US vs EU vs UK) and case-informed thresholds.
    - >-
      Leadership lacks KPIs to quantify risk reduction, cycle time improvements,
      and ROI from triage/clearance tooling.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multimodal similarity engine combining melody/motif extraction, chord
      progression analysis, timbre/spectral features, and lyric semantic
      embeddings to surface top-N potential conflicts.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-aware risk scoring grounded in publicly known case law
      patterns (e.g., melodic motif length/uniqueness, substantial similarity
      factors).
    - >-
      Explainable outputs: aligned melody contours, lyric n-gram/semantic
      overlaps, harmonic path comparisons, and time-stamped audio excerpts with
      similarity heatmaps.
    - >-
      Workflow-native delivery: batch uploads, watch folders, and REST APIs;
      plugins for Synchtank/Vistex; SSO and role-based permissions.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance: immutable scan logs, model+dataset versioning, and
      exportable PDF reports for counsel/insurers; SOC 2 roadmap.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop queue so legal/musicology can confirm/override flags;
      active learning to continuously improve precision/recall.
    - >-
      Data coverage strategy: licensed lyric corpora and publisher-provided
      audio/metadata; embeddings built for both released and unreleased works
      under strict security.
    - >-
      Service-level commitments: <15s median scan for 3-min track, 99.9% API
      uptime, and dedicated support for enterprise rollouts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered lyric and audio similarity triage that flags potentially
    infringing works within seconds, explains why, and integrates into publisher
    workflows—reducing manual review time by 50–70%, lowering false negatives,
    and creating an audit-ready trail to support defensible clearance decisions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A defensible, explainable multimodal similarity stack trained and validated
    on a curated, expert-labeled benchmark informed by real disputes; early OEM
    integrations with rights-tech platforms; and insurer-aligned reporting that
    ties similarity evidence to risk decisions, creating switching costs via
    embedded workflows and audit trails.
