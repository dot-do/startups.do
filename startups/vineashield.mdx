  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable frost and heat events cause 5–20% yield loss and quality
      downgrades; decisions are made with coarse forecasts not reflecting
      block-level microclimates.
    - >-
      Wind machines are often started too early/late; 1 hour of unnecessary
      runtime costs $25–$60 in fuel/electricity per machine per event.
    - >-
      Irrigation during heat waves is reactive; over- or under-watering wastes
      10–30% of water and risks berry sunburn or dilution.
    - >-
      Existing tools lack wet-bulb/inversion guidance; managers need actionable
      thresholds, not generic temperature alerts.
    - >-
      Labor-intensive night monitoring leads to fatigue, overtime, and
      inconsistent response across blocks.
    - >-
      Compliance pressures (water allocations, pumping curtailments, air
      quality) require defensible, auditable decisions.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (station, sensor, satellite, controller), preventing
      integrated, ROI-driven action plans.
    - >-
      Small to mid-sized vineyards can’t justify full-time analysts to translate
      weather into block-level actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hyperlocal 0–120 hr frost/heat stress forecasts down to block level using
      terrain-aware downscaling and on-site calibration.
    - >-
      Wet-bulb and inversion-strength predictions with start/stop thresholds for
      wind machines, customized by phenology and risk tolerance.
    - >-
      Prescriptive irrigation plans for pre-cooling and recovery (timing,
      duration, flow), optimized for water allocations and pump constraints.
    - >-
      Automated alerts (SMS/app/voice) with confidence levels and actionable
      checklists; escalation by block and role.
    - >-
      Device integrations to schedule wind machines and valves; safety
      interlocks and manual override.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: cost/benefit for different start times, runtimes, and
      irrigation volumes with expected risk reduction.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready logs (who/what/when/why), water/energy usage estimates,
      and event outcomes for audits and insurance.
    - Mobile-first UI for crews; bilingual (EN/ES); offline-safe alerts.
    - >-
      Post-event analytics: hit/miss reports, false positive/negative analysis,
      ROI summary per event.
    - >-
      White-glove onboarding: sensor audit, station placement guidance, and
      calibration against historical events.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Block-level frost/heat risk forecasts and automated playbooks that cut
    energy and water use while protecting yield and quality—integrated directly
    with wind machines and irrigation controllers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Phenology-aware wet-bulb/inversion engine and OEM control integrations
    validated by third-party field trials, plus a growing, regionally diverse
    dataset that improves block-level accuracy and ROI over time—difficult to
    replicate without long-term, multi-AVA deployments.

  character: >-
    Vineyard managers and winery operations leaders who must protect fruit
    quality and yields while controlling water and energy use.
  problem: >-
    External: Erratic frost and heatwaves threaten buds, canopy, and flavor.
    Internal: High-stakes, late-night decisions driven by guesswork create
    stress and overtime. Philosophical: World‑class wine shouldn’t be left to
    weather roulette.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pain of losing a block overnight and overspending
    on water, diesel, and labor. Authority: Our AI fuses hyperlocal weather,
    phenology, soil moisture, and equipment data; validated across multiple
    seasons and AVAs for wineries (NAICS 312130).
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect weather stations, sensors, and block maps; 2) Get 12–48
    hr frost/heat windows with risk scores; 3) Follow precise pre‑cooling, wind
    machine start, and irrigation prescriptions; 4) Review outcomes to refine
    settings. Agreement: Data is private, integrations are supported, and ROI is
    measured each season.
