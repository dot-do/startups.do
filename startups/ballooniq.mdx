  problem:
    - >-
      Manual ballooning and AS9102/FAIR creation is slow (4–12 hours per new
      part), error-prone, and inconsistent across inspectors.
    - >-
      High rework and NCR risk from missed characteristics, misinterpreted GD&T,
      and transcription errors between drawing and forms.
    - >-
      Aerospace/defense suppliers must meet AS9102 Rev. C requirements and
      prime-specific templates, creating administrative burden and delays in FAI
      approval.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain (PDF editors, spreadsheets, QMS/MES, CMM) with little
      interoperability; double data entry is common.
    - >-
      Security/compliance constraints (ITAR/EAR) limit cloud-based tools and
      require on-prem or GovCloud options.
    - >-
      Limited availability of experienced quality engineers increases cycle time
      and onboarding costs for new hires/temps.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Upload PDFs (native or scanned) and/or 3D models with PMI (STEP
      AP242, CATIA/NX/SolidWorks/Creo MBD).
    - >-
      AI extraction: Detect views/notes, auto-balloon features, parse
      dimensions, tolerances, GD&T, finish/callouts, key/critical
      characteristics; confidence scoring per characteristic.
    - >-
      Inspection planning: Auto-generate inspection plans with sampling
      (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 options), measurement method suggestions, gage/CMM routing,
      and risk tags (KPC/CTQ).
    - >-
      AS9102 generation: Fill Forms 1–3 (Rev. C) with traceability back to
      balloons; support prime-specific templates (Boeing, Lockheed, RTX, etc.).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Side-by-side verification, redlines, overrides; audit
      trail and e-sign workflows; RPN prompts for flagged ambiguities.
    - >-
      Integrations/exports: QIF 3.0, CSV/Excel, Net-Inspect, High QA/Inspection
      Manager, ProShop ERP, Plex/MES, SAP QM, Teamcenter/Windchill/3DX; CMM
      program pre-population (Zeiss/PC-DMIS/Calypso).
    - >-
      Deployment: Secure cloud (SOC 2/ISO 27001) or ITAR/EAR-compliant
      on-prem/appliance; SSO/SAML, role-based access; data residency controls.
    - >-
      Governance: Change tracking across revisions/ECNs; compare drawings,
      auto-update balloons and delta characteristics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut FAI cycle time by 60–80% and reduce NCRs due to documentation errors by
    30–50% with AI that auto-balloons drawings, extracts all
    characteristics/tolerances from 2D and MBD, and generates ready-to-submit
    AS9102 Rev. C forms and inspection plans—securely, with human-in-the-loop
    control and seamless QMS/MES/CMM integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, continuously expanding dataset of aerospace-specific drawings and
    MBD with verified ground truth; synthetic data to cover rare GD&T
    constructs; deep QIF/AS9102 template IP; and an ITAR-ready on-prem inference
    stack. Combined, these yield higher extraction accuracy, faster deployment
    in regulated environments, and OEM/Prime trust that is hard to replicate.
