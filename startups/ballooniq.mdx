  problem:
    - >-
      Manual ballooning of drawings typically takes 60–180 minutes per print and
      is error-prone (missed dims, mis-numbering, wrong tolerances), delaying
      FAI/PPAP approvals.
    - >-
      Frequent ECNs/revisions force re-ballooning and rework; current tools
      don’t reliably map changes or preserve numbering, causing 10–20%
      duplication of effort per rev.
    - >-
      Many shops receive low-quality PDFs/scans; OCR/GD&T extraction accuracy is
      poor with generic tools, driving manual data entry into characteristic
      lists and forms.
    - >-
      Preparing AS9102 and PPAP packages is tedious and inconsistent across
      customers; first-pass acceptance rates can be <70%, prolonging cash cycles
      and hurting supplier scores.
    - >-
      Data silos (ERP/QMS/PLM) cause duplicate entry and mismatches between
      ballooned drawings, char lists, and inspection plans.
    - >-
      Compliance and customer audits require traceability; without audit-ready
      logs and links from requirement to result, shops risk findings and
      corrective actions.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI vision + OCR purpose-built for manufacturing drawings to detect
      dimensions, GD&T, feature control frames, callouts, notes, and tables;
      auto-assign balloon numbers and link to a structured characteristic list.
    - >-
      One-click generation of AS9102 Forms 1–3 and AIAG PPAP (Level 3)
      documents; auto-populate fields from drawings, BOM/routing, and past
      submissions.
    - >-
      Revision-aware change detection: side-by-side diff with preserved balloon
      numbering, carry-forward of unchanged characteristics, and audit-ready
      traceability.
    - >-
      Inspection plan builder: sampling plans (ANSI Z1.4/ASQ), gage assignments,
      operation steps, and measured data templates; exports to
      CSV/XLSX/QIF/Net-Inspect XML.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: SOC 2-ready multi-tenant, private VPC, or
      on-prem (Windows/Linux) with SSO, RBAC, encryption, and audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Produce ballooned drawings, characteristic lists, inspection plans, and
    AS9102/PPAP-ready packages in minutes (95%+ extraction accuracy on standard
    prints), even from noisy PDFs/scans—integrated with your ERP/QMS,
    revision-aware, and deployable in secure cloud or on-prem for ITAR/EAR work.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built dataset and model stack for manufacturing drawings
    (including degraded scans and mixed GD&T symbology), plus revision-aware
    automation and deep ERP/QMS integrations—combined with secure deployment
    options (GovCloud/on-prem) that clear ITAR/CMMC requirements, enabling
    adoption by aerospace/defense suppliers where generic OCR or CAD-native
    tools fall short.
