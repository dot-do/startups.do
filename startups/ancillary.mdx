  problem:
    - >-
      Static or coarse seat-fee rules leave revenue on the table: same price by
      cabin/row/time regardless of demand mix, leading to 5–20% underpricing or
      spoilage of premium seats.
    - >-
      Disjointed seat blocking/release policies for elites, families, and
      operational holds cause unnecessary spoilage and last-minute re-seating
      costs.
    - >-
      Ancillary offers (bags, priority, lounge, Wi‑Fi) are not contextually
      bundled with seat choices, missing cross-sell uplift near checkout and
      pre-departure windows.
    - >-
      Airlines lack seat-level experimentation and attribution; difficult to
      measure incremental revenue from merchandising changes across channels
      (web, app, NDC, call center).
    - >-
      Real-time constraints (sub-100 ms) and compliance (ACAA/ADA, family
      seating, partner JV rules) limit adoption of generalized ML models.
    - >-
      Operational realities (irregular ops, weight & balance, aircraft swaps)
      make manual overrides frequent and error-prone.
    - >-
      In-house builds compete with core RM roadmap; integrations across
      PSS/GDS/NDC are costly and slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic seat-level pricing: real-time optimization per seat, per PNR
      context, per device/channel, with sub-100 ms response SLAs.
    - >-
      Policy-aware release/block engine: time-phased holds for elites, families,
      crew and operational blocks with auto-release rules tied to load factor,
      D- time, and forecasted late-booker value.
    - >-
      Contextual offers: bundle seats with relevant ancillaries (e.g., seat +
      priority boarding + overhead guarantee) based on trip purpose, party size,
      fare family, and historical attach propensity.
    - >-
      Experimentation and attribution: built-in A/B/n and multi-armed bandits
      with revenue guardrails; incremental uplift measured at flight and
      route-day level with holdouts.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: model impacts of rule changes (e.g., release T-48 vs
      T-24) on revenue, CSAT, and spoilage before going live.
    - >-
      Ops-aware guardrails: auto-adjust for aircraft swaps, IROPS, family
      seating guarantees, ACAA/ADA accessibility rules, and alliance/JV partner
      seat-sharing constraints.
    - >-
      Channel coverage: PSS seat map APIs (Amadeus Altéa, SabreSonic, Navitaire,
      Radixx), NDC offers/orders, airline web/app, call center scripting, and
      kiosk where supported.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Seat- and passenger-aware AI that dynamically prices seats, manages
    releases/blocks, and targets ancillary bundles in real time, lifting seat
    and ancillary revenue 3–8% while preserving loyalty benefits and regulatory
    compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Seat-aware AI with embedded policy/compliance engine and experimentation
    built for airline constraints: per-seat utility modeling, elite/family/ADA
    guardrails, and sub-100 ms pricing that runs across PSS, NDC, and direct
    channels. Early-mover datasets of seat-level conversions and spoilage
    patterns create defensible model performance over time.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers with high ancillary share of revenue
      (target ARPP > $25, attach rate > 35%).
    - >-
      Hybrid and full-service carriers monetizing preferred seats, extra
      legroom, and exit rows while protecting loyalty entitlements.
    - >-
      Regional and leisure-focused carriers with strong seasonal demand swings
      and high family-travel mix.
    - >-
      Airline commercial roles: Chief Commercial Officer, Head of Revenue
      Management, Head of Digital/E-commerce, Ancillary Merchandising Lead,
      Loyalty/CRM Lead, CIO/CTO for integration sponsorship.

      NDC aggregators/TPIs (Duffel, Travelfusion) co-sell for airline
      web-services modernization programs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Airline revenue, eCommerce, and ancillary leaders who must grow seat and
    add-on revenue without harming satisfaction or operations.
  problem: >-
    Static seat-map rules and blunt pricing leave premium inventory unsold,
    cannibalize fare value, frustrate travelers, and ignore context like load
    factor, O&D, elite status, time-to-departure, and disruptions.
  guide: >-
    Ancillary & Seat Map Revenue Optimizer—an explainable, airline-grade AI that
    learns demand patterns, honors brand and operational constraints, and helps
    your team sell the right seat and ancillary to the right customer at the
    right time.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect securely: integrate with PSS/CRS/NDC/DCS and web/app; import
    policies, waivers, and guardrails. 2) Calibrate: train on historicals; run
    sandbox and A/B tests; set caps, fairness, and elite protections. 3) Launch
    and govern: go live on a pilot market/fleet; monitor KPIs; iterate with
    transparent controls, alerts, and safe fallbacks.
  callToAction: >-
    Request a demo and uplift assessment; start an 8–12 week pilot on one fleet
    or market.
  success: >-
    Real-time, context-aware seat pricing, releases/blocks, and targeted offers
    that increase ancillary revenue and attach rate, improve seat utilization
    and NPS, and give teams transparent control and reliable reporting.
  failure: >-
    Continue leaving money on the table, depart with empty extra-legroom seats,
    show irrelevant offers, depress NPS, and rely on brittle manual rules and
    static configurations.
