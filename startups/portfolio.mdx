  problem:
    - >-
      Credit deterioration in commercial portfolios is detected too late (often
      at annual/quarterly review), leading to higher loss given default and
      surprise NPLs.
    - >-
      Relationship managers and portfolio teams cannot monitor thousands of
      borrowers continuously across unstructured signals (news, filings, legal
      events) and structured triggers (bureau, internal behaviors).
    - >-
      Existing tools either rely on internal data only, generate high false
      positives, or lack explainability that satisfies model risk management
      requirements.
    - >-
      Watchlist processes are reactive, manual, and inconsistent across teams,
      making it hard to prioritize interventions and document rationale for
      regulatory exams.
    - >-
      Banks face pressure to improve CECL/IFRS 9 provisioning accuracy and
      demonstrate quantitative early warning controls to regulators and
      auditors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingest of external signals (news, regulatory filings, legal/UCC
      events, macro/industry indices, bureau triggers) and internal behavioral
      data (deposit flows, covenants, delinquencies).
    - >-
      Entity resolution and borrower-linkage engine to map articles, filings,
      and events to legal entities and hierarchies in the bank’s portfolio.
    - >-
      Multi-model early-warning score with reason codes, confidence, and
      time-to-risk estimates; challenger models and backtesting for MRM.
    - >-
      Configurable triggers library and watchlist automation with tiered
      alerting, deduplication, and materiality thresholds.
    - >-
      Analyst and RM workflow: triage queue, note-taking, evidence packs,
      escalation routing, and integration to ticketing/CRM (e.g., Salesforce,
      nCino).
    - >-
      APIs and data feeds to push scores/alerts into risk dashboards, data
      lakes, and credit review packs; sandbox for portfolio stress overlays.
    - >-
      Governance artifacts: model cards, validation datasets, performance
      monitoring, drift/stability reports aligned to SR 11-7/OCC guidance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect borrower-level credit deterioration 3–6 months earlier with 50–70%
    fewer false positives, delivered with audit-ready explainability and
    seamless integration to your core banking, LOS, and CRM—so you can act
    before risk becomes loss.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Privacy-preserving cross-bank learning and benchmarking (federated models)
    that improve signal quality without sharing raw data; combined with
    audit-ready explainability packs and pre-validated connectors to major
    cores/LOS. Over time, accumulating outcome-labeled alerts across sectors
    creates a defensible, hard-to-replicate dataset and model performance edge.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: US commercial banks (assets $5B–$500B) with material C&I/CRE
      exposure; Risk/Portfolio Management, Credit Administration, Special

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Commercial bank credit, risk, and portfolio leaders who need to spot
    borrower stress early and act before performance deteriorates.
  problem: >-
    External: watchlists are manual and lagging; signals are scattered across
    news, filings, macro, and bureau updates. Internal: fear of being blindsided
    in reviews and exams. Philosophical: you shouldn’t discover risk after
    losses hit.
  guide: >-
    We get the pressure to protect the book and satisfy regulators. Portfolio
    Early‑Warning System (EWS) turns news, filings, macro, and bureau triggers
    into borrower‑level scores and explainable alerts—backtested on historical
    events and delivered with model documentation and monitoring to support MRM.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect data and upload portfolio; 2) Calibrate thresholds and
    policies; 3) Monitor alerts, triage watchlists, and act (CRM/LOS workflow).
    Risk reduction: pilot in a sandbox, minimal required data, clear SLAs and
    exit options.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30‑minute demo or launch a 90‑day pilot. Transitional:
    request a sample watchlist for your portfolio and the methodology brief.
  success: >-
    Proactive risk management: earlier detection and downgrades, lower
    NPLs/charge‑offs and provisions, smoother exams, saved analyst hours, and
    confident RM outreach with clear rationales.
  failure: >-
    Status quo: missed signals, late downgrades, exam findings, higher reserves
    and losses, reactive fire drills, and strained client relationships.

  problem:
    - Emerging borrower risk is missed between periodic reviews.
    - Manual monitoring of news and filings is slow and inconsistent.
    - 'Alerts are noisy and lack evidence, leading to alert fatigue.'
    - Watchlists are subjective and vary by team.
    - Limited visibility across long-tail and SME borrowers.
    - Late detection drives higher provisions and workout costs.
    - 'Data is scattered across systems, slowing response time.'
  solution:
    - See borrower-level risk shifts early with continuously updated scores.
    - Automate monitoring using multi-source triggers in one ranked watchlist.
    - 'Get explainable alerts with sources, severity, and trend direction.'
    - 'Cover the full portfolio, including smaller exposures.'
    - Align thresholds and policies to your risk appetite.
    - Push alerts into LOS/CRM to trigger timely action and follow-up.
    - Track outcomes to refine thresholds and reduce false positives.
  features:
    - >-
      Multi-source signals: news, regulatory filings, credit bureau/tradeline
      shifts, macro and sector stress overlays.
    - Entity resolution and borrower mapping across subsidiaries and UBOs.
    - 'Materiality scoring with evidence snippets, timestamps, and source links.'
    - 'Configurable alerts: thresholds, keywords, exclusions, and sectors/geos.'
    - 'Portfolio views: watchlists, heatmaps, and trend dashboards by segment.'
    - 'Workflow tools: assign, comment, snooze, resolve, and audit trail.'
    - APIs and webhooks for LOS/CRM/Risk systems; SFTP for batch jobs.
    - >-
      Security and governance: encryption, access controls, and detailed
      logging.
    - >-
      Model monitoring: drift detection, precision/recall tracking, feedback
      loops.
    - 'Implementation options: cloud-hosted or VPC deployment.'
  steps:
    - Connect borrower data and identifiers via secure upload or API.
    - Select signal sources and set alert thresholds by policy.
    - Backtest on historical data to calibrate precision/recall.
    - Deploy watchlists to RMs and credit teams via UI and integrations.
    - Review weekly risk shifts; assign and track actions.
    - Continuously tune thresholds using user feedback and outcomes.
