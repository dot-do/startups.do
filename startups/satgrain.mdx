  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden crop stress in minor grains is detected too late. In-season
      scouting happens weekly at best, leading to 7–14 day lag in response;
      typical avoidable yield loss 2–8% in barley/oats/sorghum due to late
      nitrogen, disease, waterlogging, or lodging response.
    - >-
      Existing remote-sensing tools are optimized for corn/soy/wheat, not minor
      grains—resulting in 20–40% higher false positives/negatives and limited
      actionable prescriptions for barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, and
      triticale.
    - >-
      Advisors and co-ops cover 50k–200k acres each and can’t physically scout
      all fields; cloud cover blocks optical imagery, and growers lack
      SAR-enabled alerts for hail/lodging, waterlogging, and emergence gaps.
    - >-
      Minor grain growers are price-sensitive; high-res analytics are costly,
      and tools don’t quantify ROI or deliver controller-ready variable-rate
      files, reducing adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated weekly pipeline fusing Sentinel-2 (10 m), Landsat 8/9 (30 m),
      and Sentinel-1 SAR (10 m) with weather and soil/topography layers to
      detect emergence gaps, nutrient stress (NDRE-based), waterlogging/drought,
      hail/lodging, and disease risk.
    - >-
      Field-specific zones and variable-rate prescription files (ISOXML,
      shapefile) for N top-dress, PGRs, fungicides, and replant decisions, with
      suggested rates and economic impact estimates per zone.
    - >-
      Mobile, email, and SMS alerts with severity scores (0–100), confidence
      intervals, and recommended response windows (e.g., ‘treat within 72
      hours’).
    - >-
      Benchmarks vs. peers and historical field performance with yield potential
      updates; includes side-by-side check-strip guidance to quantify ROI.
    - >-
      API and integrations with John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView,
      Ag Leader SMS, and Farm Management Software to streamline deployment and
      prove value.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weekly SAR+optical satellite monitoring purpose-built for minor grains that
    finds stress 5–10 days earlier than scouting and turns it into actionable,
    controller-ready prescriptions—delivering 3–6x ROI per acre.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built, validated models for minor grains
    (barley/oats/rye/sorghum/millet/triticale) with multi-year, multi-region
    labeled datasets; SAR+optical hail/lodging and waterlogging detection
    uncommon among competitors; controller-ready prescriptions and documented
    ROI via on-farm check strips; distribution through co-ops and malt/grain
    buyer sponsorships accelerates adoption and lowers CAC.

  character: >-
    Minor‑grain growers (sorghum, millet, oats, barley, rye, quinoa, etc.) who
    want to protect yield and manage every acre without more scouting.
  problem: >-
    Early stress, emergence gaps, waterlogging/drought, hail/lodging, and
    nutrient issues often go unseen until they cut yield—because time, labor,
    and weather make whole‑farm scouting hard.

    lookout—reviewing fresh satellite and weather data weekly and translating it
    into clear, trusted insights.
  plan: >-
    1) Enroll fields and set alert thresholds. 2) Weekly remote sensing flags
    stress and anomalies. 3) Receive zone maps and targeted actions. 4) Treat
    and verify with the next scan.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free pilot (upload fields, get first maps in days) or subscribe per
    acre for the season.
  success: >-
    Catch issues earlier, protect yield, target inputs to the right zones,
    reduce scouting time, and make timely, confident decisions.
  failure: >-
    Missed early stress, wasted inputs, preventable yield loss, and costly
    surprises at harvest.
