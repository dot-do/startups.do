leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable lock queues at Soo, Welland, and St. Lawrence Seaway cause
      1–4 hours average ETA variance per lock, with seasonal peaks up to 6–12
      hours, degrading schedule reliability.
    - >-
      Loitering and stop-go operations near locks burn 0.3–1.2 tonnes of fuel
      per hour (aux + main), costing roughly $300–$1,200/h at $1,000/ton and
      adding 1–3 tCO2/h.
    - >-
      Dispatchers rely on radio/website updates and experience; there is no
      accurate 6–24h predictive queue outlook per lock or actionable speed/RPM
      guidance to hit low-queue windows.
    - >-
      Speeding to arrive early and then idling negates slow-steaming benefits,
      increasing engine wear, crew workload, and safety risk in congested
      approaches.
    - >-
      Poor lock-berth-port synchronization leads to berth misses and
      demurrage/contractual penalties (e.g., $5k–$20k per event).
    - >-
      Weather, currents, water levels, and ice conditions materially change
      transit times and gating plans but are not integrated into current
      planning tools.
    - >-
      Charterers, terminals, and pilots lack a common predictive view, creating
      coordination frictions and fragmented decision-making.
  solution:
    - >-
      Lock-specific queue prediction engine (Soo, Welland, Seaway) combining
      historical lockage events, AIS tracks, declared transits, weather/ice,
      water levels, and maintenance windows.
    - >-
      Arrival speed/RPM optimization to hit “no-wait windows,” accounting for
      vessel power curves, EEOI targets, and crew operating constraints.
    - >-
      Dynamic ETA chain for multi-lock voyages with confidence bands and what-if
      scenarios (e.g., speed changes, weather shifts, convoy sequencing).
    - >-
      Berth synchronization: suggest speed adjustments to align with pilot
      windows/berth availability to minimize idle and demurrage risk.
    - >-
      Alerting via email/SMS/satcom for queue spikes, lock delays, or
      recommended speed changes; offline fallback with onboard cache.
    - >-
      APIs and lightweight bridge app; optional ECDIS overlay or integration
      with fleet optimization suites (Navtor, Wärtsilä FOS, ZeroNorth, Nautilus
      Labs).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce lock waiting time by 20–40% and fuel consumption by 3–8% per voyage
    via 6–24h lock-queue prediction and arrival speed/RPM advisories tuned to
    lock operations, weather/ice, and vessel performance. Achieve <20-minute MAE
    on lock wait forecasts, integrate with bridge and dispatcher workflows in
    under 2 weeks, and deliver a 5–10x ROI with optional performance-based
    pricing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Authority-aligned data partnerships plus per-lock, season-aware models
    produce materially better forecasts than generic port congestion tools;
    embedded workflow integrations (ECDIS/dispatcher), offline operability, and
    ROI-guarantee pilots create switching costs and credible differentiation
    specific to the Great Lakes/Seaway niche.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary buyers: Great Lakes laker operators (dry bulk, cement, ore, grain)
      — ~120–140 vessels across major fleets (e.g., Algoma, CSL, Interlake,

  character: >-
    Shipowners, captains, and dispatchers moving freight across the Great Lakes
    and coastal routes who must hit windows at the Soo Locks, Welland Canal, and
    St. Lawrence Seaway while minimizing idle and fuel burn.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable lock queues and changing conditions force ships to speed up,
    then sit and wait—wasting fuel, missing lockages, paying overtime and
    penalties. Operators feel blind and pressured; it shouldn’t take burning
    tons of fuel to stand still in a line.
  guide: >-
    Lock Queue + Arrival Speed Manager is an AI decision service trained on AIS,
    lockage data, weather, and historical dwell. We speak lock operations and
    bridge realities, providing transparent forecasts with confidence bands and
    practical, bridge-friendly recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect AIS/API and share vessel specs and route. 2) Get rolling 0–48h
    lock-queue forecasts plus recommended arrival speeds/RPM to hit optimal lock
    windows. 3) Act via bridge email/ECDIS/API; ops track savings. No hardware,
    quick pilot, 24/7 support.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on Soo/Welland/Seaway routes; book a 20-minute demo;
    request an API key and sample forecast.
  success: >-
    Arrive just-in-time, cut lock idle 15–30%, trim fuel 3–8%, reduce
    overtime/demurrage, improve ETA reliability and customer scorecards, lower
    CO2/NOx, and lift margin per voyage.
  failure: >-
    Keep racing to wait—burning fuel, missing slots, incurring
    overtime/demurrage, frustrating crews and charterers, missing emissions
    targets, and eroding voyage margins.
