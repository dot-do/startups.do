leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Independent florists lose online orders after-hours and during peak
      holidays because no one answers phones or website chats.
    - >-
      Website visitors have repetitive questions (delivery area, cutoff times,
      substitutions, funeral/hospital policies) that staff answer manually,
      consuming 10–20 hours/week.
    - >-
      Existing contact forms don’t capture structured order data or route to
      payment, causing drop-off and manual re-entry into POS/CRM.
    - >-
      Most chat widgets are generic; they don’t understand floral products,
      delivery windows, card messages, or local delivery rules.
    - >-
      Florists use fragmented tools (website, POS, payments, CRM) with no smooth
      handoff; staff must copy-paste details, leading to errors and missed
      deliveries.
    - >-
      Seasonality (Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day) creates volume spikes that
      current teams can’t handle without temporary staff.
  solution:
    - >-
      Embed a florist-trained chat widget that understands delivery policies,
      product substitutes, occasions, and local delivery zones.
    - >-
      Guided order intake flow: recipient details, address validation, card
      message, delivery date/time, product selection, and upsells (vase,
      chocolates, balloons).
    - >-
      Instant payment via secure Stripe/Square checkout link; no card data
      handled by the chatbot to maintain PCI scope.
    - >-
      Automatic order creation in POS/CRM with line items, delivery notes, card
      message, and customer contact; email/SMS confirmations to buyer.
    - >-
      After-hours mode that prioritizes order capture and clear cutoff
      messaging, with dynamic availability based on inventory/delivery windows.
    - >-
      Live-human handoff to shop staff via SMS/web app for edge cases;
      conversation transcript logged to CRM.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 florist-savvy chat that answers FAQs, captures full orders with
    upsells, routes to secure payment, and logs everything to your
    POS/CRM—boosting online conversions and cutting phone time without adding
    staff.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized, continuously improving florist domain model and integration
    coverage (POS + payments + address validation), plus a growing dataset of
    seasonal intents and product/upsell performance unique to florists—hard for
    generic chatbots to replicate. Early association and POS partnerships create
    distribution lock-in.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Independent brick-and-mortar florists with 1–3 locations,

    - >-
      Secondary: Regional florist chains (4–25 locations) needing centralized
      brand control and local delivery rules per shop.
    - >-
      Tertiary: Event/wedding-focused florists seeking lead capture and
      qualification (budget, date, venue) rather than instant checkout.
    - >-
      Agencies/website developers serving florists who want a packaged chatbot +
      order intake solution.
  channels:
