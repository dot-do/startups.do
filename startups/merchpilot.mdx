  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers spend 45–90 minutes per unit to collect specs, write copy, edit
      photos, and publish listings across multiple channels (website, RV Trader,
      RVT, social), delaying time-to-market and increasing holding costs.
    - >-
      Listings are inconsistent (missing specs, poor photos, duplicate VINs),
      hurting SEO, marketplace ranking, and lead conversion.
    - >-
      Manual cross-posting leads to feed errors (title/field mismatches,
      disallowed words), duplicate listings, and outdated pricing across
      channels.
    - >-
      Dealers lack in-house content/SEO capability to produce compelling,
      keyword-rich descriptions and short-form video at scale.
    - >-
      Current tools are generic (auto-focused or image-only) and do not
      understand RV-specific taxonomy (classes, slide-outs, floorplans, tank
      sizes, GVWR, options).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests raw unit data (DMS/CSV/VIN), normalizes it to an RV-specific
      schema (class, floorplan, slides, tanks, dimensions, options), and
      auto-writes SEO-optimized titles/descriptions.
    - >-
      Computer vision enhances photos (background cleanup, sky replacement,
      window glare reduction, lot branding), auto-selects hero images, and
      generates short vertical videos and 360-style spins from photo sets.
    - >-
      One-click multi-channel publishing to dealer website, RV Trader, RVT,
      social (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok), and Google Business
      Profile—with automated price/availability sync.
    - >-
      Listing health scoring (completeness, duplicate detection, keyword
      density, feed validation) and SEO insights (ranking, impressions, CTR)
      with recommended fixes.
    - >-
      Workflow tools: approval queues, brand style guardrails, role-based
      access, and audit trails for compliance.
    - >-
      APIs and pre-built connectors to DMS/IMS/website providers to keep
      inventory current and reduce double entry.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Publish SEO-rich, media-enhanced RV listings to every channel in minutes—not
    hours—boosting lead volume 20–35% while keeping data, pricing, and branding
    consistent automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving RV-specific data/vision/LLM stack (ontology,
    labeled media, spec mappings) plus certified marketplace and DMS/website
    integrations that reduce feed errors and time-to-live below generalist
    tools. Network effects from multi-dealer data improve copy and media
    recommendations over time.
