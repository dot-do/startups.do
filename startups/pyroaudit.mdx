  problem:
    - >-
      Manual auditing of furnace logs, TUS/SAT records, and job travelers is
      labor-intensive (20–80 hours/site/month), error-prone, and varies by
      auditor skill, leading to inconsistent compliance and unexpected Nadcap
      findings.
    - >-
      Nonconformances are often discovered weeks after production because log
      reviews are retrospective; potential escapes drive costly rework, MRB, or
      scrappage.
    - >-
      Scheduling and documenting TUS/SAT, instrument calibrations, and sensor
      life tracking across multiple furnaces is complex; overdue tasks or
      missing traceability cause MAJOR/MINOR findings.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across furnace controllers (Eurotherm, Honeywell,
      Yokogawa, Watlow, SSI), SCADA/historians, spreadsheets, and paper
      records—making end-to-end traceability hard.
    - >-
      Updating to new/changed requirements in AMS2750 and Nadcap checklists
      requires deep expertise; shops struggle to maintain current
      interpretations and evidence packs.
    - >-
      Preparing for Nadcap audits consumes 1–3 FTE-months per event, and CAPA
      cycles are prolonged due to weak root-cause evidence and incomplete
      objective data.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from furnace controllers, historians, and files
      (Eurotherm/Schneider, Honeywell, Yokogawa, Watlow, SSI; CSV, OPC UA, REST;
      secure agents for on-prem/air-gapped).
    - >-
      Rules engine encoding AMS2750 pyrometry requirements and Nadcap HT
      checklists with site-configurable parameters (instrument types, SAT
      methods, TUS tolerances, sensor usage limits, calibration intervals).
    - >-
      Continuous log auditing: detect out-of-tolerance cycles, ramp/soak
      nonconformances, missing alarms, sensor drift, unauthorized thermocouple
      reuse, and incomplete job data.
    - >-
      TUS/SAT scheduler and validator: forecast due dates; auto-validate TUS/SAT
      results against class/tolerance, load size, and sensor placement; flag
      calculation/reporting errors.
    - >-
      Job traveler cross-check: reconcile recipe, furnace class, instrumentation
      type, load thermocouples, calibration certs, and required documentation;
      link to material specs.
    - >-
      Evidence pack generator: auditor-ready, time-sequenced packages with
      objective data, screenshots, raw logs, and rule citations; change logs
      tied to standards revisions.
    - >-
      CAPA workflow integration: auto-drafted NCRs with suspected root cause and
      impacted lots; APIs to QMS/ERP/MES (e.g., eQMS, SAP, Epicor, ProShop).
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: on-prem, cloud, or hybrid; ITAR/EAR-aware data
      residency and access controls; audit trails and immutability options.
    - >-
      Explainable AI anomaly detection on time-series: highlights deviations,
      drift, and data gaps with confidence scoring; tunable to reduce false
      positives.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate end-to-end pyrometry and heat-treat compliance for nonferrous
    forging—continuously audit furnace data, TUS/SAT, and job records against
    configurable AMS2750/Nadcap rules, surface actionable nonconformances in
    hours (not weeks), and deliver auditor-ready evidence packs that cut audit
    prep time by 50–70% and reduce MAJOR/MINOR findings by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Heat‑treat and quality leaders at nonferrous forging plants who must keep
    furnaces compliant and parts flowing while passing AMS2750/Nadcap audits.
  problem: >-
    Manually auditing furnace logs, TUS/SAT, and job records is slow and
    error‑prone. Specs change, instruments drift, and evidence is
    scattered—putting Nadcap accreditation, delivery, and margins at risk.
  guide: >-
    Built with metallurgists and Nadcap auditors, we pair pyrometry expertise
    with AI. We understand the pressure of findings, escapes, and downtime—and
    how forging shops really run.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect furnace logs, TUS/SAT results, and job records. 2) Configure
    AMS2750 and customer specs (classes, tolerances, sensor maps). 3) Run
    continuous AI audits that flag issues with traceable evidence, root cause,
    and fixes; auto‑generate audit‑ready packages.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and start a pilot. Upload sample data for a free
    compliance scan and gap report.
  success: >-
    Be audit‑ready every day: clear, centralized evidence; faster release; fewer
    findings; lower scrap and rework; confident AMS2750/Nadcap compliance;
    visibility into furnace performance trends.
  failure: >-
    Avoid reactive fire drills: missed SAT/TUS issues, undocumented deviations,
    NCRs, production delays, lost accreditation, and costly escapes.
