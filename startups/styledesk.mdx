leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Shrinking copy desks have increased error rates and time-to-publish; many
      newsrooms lack dedicated line editors on nights/weekends.
    - >-
      Existing grammar tools (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Editor) are not tuned
      to AP or in-house rules, producing false positives and missed violations
      that erode trust.
    - >-
      Inconsistent application of AP and in-house style across
      reporters/freelancers leads to rework, reader complaints, and brand
      inconsistency.
    - >-
      Editors lack a unified workflow for Google Docs, Word, and CMS; tracked
      changes and inline queries break or get lost during copy/paste.
    - >-
      No reliable metrics exist to quantify style adherence, readability, and
      edit quality at the desk/section level.
    - >-
      Legal/compliance risks (defamation, sourcing, quotes, corrections) are
      hard to systematically flag under deadline pressure.
    - >-
      Onboarding new hires/freelancers onto style is slow; editors spend hours
      teaching repetitive rules instead of higher-value edits.
    - >-
      International, bilingual, and community newspapers need AP-aligned English
      plus support for in-house exceptions and Spanish-language norms.
  solution:
    - >-
      LLM-powered line edit that applies AP Stylebook rules plus
      newsroom-specific exceptions and terminology dictionaries.
    - >-
      Tracked changes and inline queries that round-trip cleanly between Google
      Docs, Microsoft Word/Office, and major newsroom CMSs.
    - >-
      Readability and tone calibration per section/beat; headline, dek, and
      social text suggestions within newsroom constraints.
    - >-
      Risk & compliance checks tuned for journalism: quote/source attribution,
      date/time/place consistency, numbers and titles, defamation risk cues,
      corrections handling.
    - >-
      Style analytics dashboard: style adherence rate, edit time saved,
      section-level QA, and reporter onboarding insights.
    - >-
      Enterprise controls: SSO, audit logs, data residency, human-in-the-loop
      approvals, configurable hallucination guardrails, and model choice (hosted
      or private).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A newsroom-grade AI copy editor that enforces AP and your in-house style
    with tracked changes and inline queries—cutting line-edit time 30–50%,
    reducing style errors 70–90%, and giving editors measurable control over
    readability, risk flags, and consistency across tools your newsroom already
    uses.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A newsroom-tuned style and risk dataset derived from real editor decisions
    (opt-in, privacy-preserving) plus deep integrations that preserve tracked
    changes and inline queries across Docs/Word/CMS—capabilities generic grammar
    tools and general AI editors lack. Over time, proprietary per-newsroom rule
    packs and exception patterns create switching costs and higher accuracy than
    off-the-shelf competitors.
