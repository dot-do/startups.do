  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage ideation for industrial design is slow and expensive: 40–100
      designer-hours per project to produce first clustered concept boards and
      presentable sheets.
    - >-
      High volume thumbnail generation yields noisy results; teams lack
      systemized clustering, deduping, and rationale to make choices
      confidently.
    - >-
      Inconsistent presentation quality across projects leads to delays in
      stakeholder buy-in; reformatting to concept sheets takes 4–8 hours per
      iteration.
    - >-
      General image models ignore constraints (dimensions, ergonomics, CMF,
      brand language), creating unbuildable or off-brand concepts.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows across tools (Miro/Figma/Keynote/Drive) cause version
      control issues, weak traceability, and IP risk.
    - >-
      Small studios and freelancers can’t scale ideation capacity to meet tight
      timelines without sacrificing exploration breadth.
    - >-
      Enterprise teams require IP-safe, private generation—consumer AI tools are
      risky for confidential briefs and regulated categories (medical,
      mobility).
  solution:
    - >-
      Brief-to-board pipeline: ingest text briefs, constraints, brand/style
      guides, and references; generate 100–500 thumbnails within minutes.
    - >-
      Automated clustering and coverage analysis: group by form language,
      functional architecture, and key attributes; visualize gaps and
      redundancies.
    - >-
      Curated concept selection: scoring based on constraints (size, ergonomics
      heuristics, CMF), brand fit, and novelty; designer-in-the-loop selection.
    - >-
      One-click concept sheets: auto-assemble 3–6 selected concepts per sheet
      with annotations, callouts, CMF swatches, quick rationale, and next-step
      prompts.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: inline reviewers’ comments, quick regenerate/variations per
      cluster, and tracked iterations for traceability.
    - >-
      Integrations: export to Figma, Miro, Keynote/PPT; share secure links with
      watermarking and access control.
    - >-
      Enterprise privacy: private model endpoints, SOC2-ready controls, and
      rights-cleared training data; optional on-prem/VPC deployments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From brief to clustered thumbnail boards and printable, on-brand concept
    sheets in under 30 minutes—IP-safe, brand-aligned, and decision-ready.
    Reduce time-to-first-concept by 70%+ while keeping designers in control.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rights-cleared, domain-specific dataset and brand-language adapters tuned
    for industrial design; secure, enterprise-ready workflows embedded directly
    into designers’ existing tools; traceable lineage from brief to sheet that
    reduces IP risk and accelerates approvals.

    Industrial designers, design leads, and hardware innovation teams who must
    turn a brief into compelling early concepts fast.
  problem: >-
    External: Vague briefs, tight timelines, and scattered thumbnail ideation
    slow teams down. Internal: Blank-page anxiety and fear of missing strong
    directions. Philosophical: Early exploration should be abundant, structured,
    and shareable—without burning budget.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the sprint pressure of needing options on the wall by
    tomorrow. Authority: An AI ideation board shaped by industrial design best
    practices—theme clustering, territory naming, presentation-ready outputs,
    and human-in-the-loop curation.
  plan: >-
    1) Submit a brief and reference assets. 2) Generate thumbnails → cluster
    into territories with rationale. 3) Curate and brand selected directions
    into concept sheets. 4) Review, comment, and iterate.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot with your next brief. Transitional: Download sample
    concept sheets and the early-ideation checklist.
  success: >-
    From brief to aligned concept territories in hours; clear rationale per
    cluster; polished sheets for stakeholder buy-in; more breadth explored with
    less cost; faster decisions on what to take to CAD.
  failure: >-
    Weeks lost to unfocused sketching, misaligned stakeholders, duplicate work,
    and safe-but-weak directions that miss the market.
