  problem:
    - >-
      Formulators iterate 30–80 lab trials over 6–12 weeks to hit target
      HLB/CMC/cloud point/foam and cost, delaying launches and consuming R&D
      budgets.
    - >-
      Mixture properties of surfactant systems are highly non-linear across
      temperature, ionic strength, water hardness, cosolvents, and actives
      ratios; HLB rules-of-thumb are insufficient for multi-component blends.
    - >-
      Existing tools (HLB calculators, DOE software, generic ML) don’t optimize
      across cost, availability, compliance, and robustness simultaneously,
      forcing manual trade-offs.
    - >-
      Raw-material variability and supply disruptions require robust recipes
      that tolerate batch-to-batch shifts without drifting out of spec.
    - >-
      Regulatory and sustainability filters (REACH/TSCA lists, EO/PO limits,
      VOC, palm-free, bio-based %) are checked late, causing rework.
    - >-
      Industrial property tests (Ross–Miles foam, cloud point curves, CMC) cost
      $200–$1,000/test and tie up equipment and technicians.
    - >-
      IP sensitivity makes data-sharing hard; most vendors can’t deliver
      privacy-preserving learning or on-prem options.
  solution:
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models predict mixture properties (CMC, cloud point
      vs. salt/temperature, foam height/decay) with uncertainty, honoring
      thermodynamic and compositional constraints.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer suggests surfactant blends and actives ratios
      that meet target windows (e.g., CMC ≤ X mM, cloud point 50–60°C, foam
      height ≥ Y mm) under cost, availability, and regulatory constraints.
    - >-
      Robust-by-design: optimize across temperature, water hardness, and batch
      variability to ensure in-spec performance under real-world conditions.
    - >-
      Active learning loop proposes the next 3–6 most-informative experiments to
      shrink uncertainty and validate models quickly.
    - >-
      Supplier library integration: searchable database of surfactants (HLB,
      EO/PO units, chain length, charge, biodegradability flags) with cost and
      lead-time metadata.
    - >-
      Compliance and sustainability filters: flag restricted substances
      (REACH/TSCA), palm-free options, VOC limits, bio-based % targets; export
      audit trails for QbD dossiers.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: LIMS/ELN connectors, CSV/API import-export,
      experiment templates, and automatic lab plan generation.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS (SOC 2-ready) or VPC/on-prem for sensitive
      IP.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  character: >-
    Formulators and product leaders at surfactant manufacturers and brands (home
    & laundry, agrochemicals, I&I, personal care) who must hit target properties
    and cost under tight timelines.
  problem: >-
    - External: Too many variables (HLB, CMC, cloud point, foam, wetting,
    electrolytes, hardness) and raw material volatility make trial-and-error
    slow and costly. - Internal: Frustration and pressure to deliver faster with
    fewer lab cycles and limited experts. - Philosophical: Smart chemistry
    shouldn’t depend on guesswork when data-driven design is possible.
  guide: >-
    We understand formulation complexity and launch pressure. Our team blends
    surfactant chemistry expertise with ML trained on structure–property data,
    thermodynamics, and validated lab results. Introducing the Formulation
    Property Optimizer: AI that recommends surfactant blends and actives ratios
    to meet target properties and cost constraints.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Define targets (HLB/CMC/cloud point/foam profile),
    constraints (actives, cost/kg, regulatory, supply). 2) Upload available raw
    materials; receive AI-recommended blends with predicted properties,
    sensitivities, and COGS. 3) Export lab-ready formulas and DOE; validate,
    iterate, and scale via API/ELN integration. Agreement plan: NDA, private
    tenant, your data stays yours, human-in-the-loop review.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot on one product line.
    Transitional: Request a free feasibility snapshot on anonymized specs or
    access a sample property–cost tradeoff report.
  success: >-
    Achieve target HLB/CMC/cloud point/foam profiles faster with fewer
    experiments, improved robustness across temperature and water hardness,
    lower COGS, clear rationale for decisions, reusable knowledge across SKUs,
    and faster, more confident launches.
  failure: >-
    Without this: extended trial-and-error, missed launch dates, inflated lab
    spend, suboptimal performance or rework after QC/regulatory checks,
    inconsistent quality across sites, and lost bids or shelf space.
