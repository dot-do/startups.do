  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage design teams waste 2–6 hours per concept turning 2D sketches
      into rough 3D blocks for reviews, turntables, and mockups.
    - >-
      Non-3D specialists (industrial designers, concept artists, UX/ID teams)
      struggle to communicate form/scale without access to a 3D specialist,
      slowing approvals by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Existing AI image tools create pretty pictures but not usable meshes
      (watertight geometry, scale alignment, clean topology), forcing rework.
    - >-
      Photogrammetry/NeRF excels with real photos, not sketches or single-view
      drawings; text-to-3D outputs are inconsistent and slow for professional
      pipelines.
    - >-
      Studios require secure, predictable turnarounds and integrations
      (Blender/Rhino/SketchUp), which current tools lack.
    - >-
      Budget-constrained teams need predictable costs; agency markups or
      outsourcing rough blockouts adds $50–$250 per asset and scheduling
      overhead.
  solution:
    - >-
      Web app and plugins accept sketches/photos (single or multi-view), infer
      depth and silhouette consistency, and output a watertight rough mesh with
      optional UVs and decimation.
    - >-
      Fast, predictable processing: 30–90 seconds per asset with a quality score
      and silhouette IoU check to ensure fidelity to the input drawing.
    - >-
      1-click turntables and shareable viewer links for non-3D stakeholders;
      downloadable OBJ/FBX/GLB with scale alignment and ground-plane snapping.
    - >-
      Batch mode for design sprints; API for automated pipelines; enterprise
      privacy controls and on-prem options.
    - >-
      In-app light sculpt/refine tools and constraints (overall dimensions,
      symmetry, corner sharpness) to get “close enough” for review without full
      modeling time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From napkin sketch or single photo to a clean, watertight rough 3D mesh
    (plus instant turntable) in under 60 seconds—export-ready for Blender,
    Rhino, SketchUp, and game engines—so teams can review, iterate, and make
    decisions the same day.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of professionally labeled
    sketch-to-rough-mesh pairs gathered via opt-in plugins and education
    partnerships, enabling category-leading accuracy on industrial design and
    massing tasks. Combined with tight DCC integrations, quality guardrails
    (silhouette IoU/watertight checks), and enterprise-grade privacy options,
    this creates a defensible feedback loop competitors lack.
