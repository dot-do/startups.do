  problem:
    - >-
      Chiropractors spend 30–90 minutes/day documenting repetitive SOAP notes,
      reducing patient-facing time and throughput.
    - >-
      Coding errors (e.g., incorrect 98940–98942 selection, missing -59/GP
      modifiers, or LCD medical necessity gaps) lead to 5–12% denied/delayed
      claims.
    - >-
      Existing EHR templates/macros are cumbersome, inconsistent across
      providers, and often lack clear audit trails tied to medical necessity.
    - >-
      General-purpose scribes/dictation tools don’t capture
      chiropractic-specific protocols (e.g., multiple spinal regions, timed PT
      codes, Medicare maintenance rules, segmental dysfunction ICD-10 mapping).
    - >-
      Small clinics lack in-house coding expertise; multi-location groups
      struggle to standardize documentation quality and compliance.
    - >-
      Providers want AI help but need HIPAA-compliant, EHR-integrated,
      low-friction capture (mobile/desktop/ambient) with minimal editing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ambient or tap-to-record audio capture during/after visit (mobile,
      desktop, or Bluetooth mic).
    - >-
      Automatic conversion to structured SOAP tailored to chiropractic (regions
      treated, objective measures, outcomes).
    - >-
      Code recommendation engine for common chiropractic CPT (e.g., 98940–98942,
      97110, 97140, 97012, G0283) and ICD-10 (e.g., M99.0x, M54.5x, R51.9), with
      medical-necessity checks, NCCI edits, and payer rules.
    - >-
      Modifier guidance (-59, -25, GP) with rationale when required; alerts for
      Medicare non-covered maintenance and ABN prompts.
    - >-
      One-click export to leading EHRs; FHIR/HL7, CSV/PDF claim packet, or
      clearinghouse-ready data.
    - >-
      Clinic-level templates, macros, and auto-learning from provider edits to
      reduce friction over time.
    - >-
      Audit trail linking each code and plan element to documented findings;
      downloadable audit pack.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every chiropractic encounter into a claim-ready, audit-defensible SOAP
    note with accurate CPT/ICD-10 suggestions—built specifically for
    chiropractic workflows—cutting documentation time by 1–2 minutes/visit and
    improving first-pass claim acceptance by 5–8%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A chiropractic-tuned transcription-to-coding engine trained on
    de-identified, specialty-specific data; embedded payer rules and audit logic
    for 98940–98942 and common PT modalities; and deep EHR integrations plus
    clinic-ready templates that minimize edits and create defensible audit
