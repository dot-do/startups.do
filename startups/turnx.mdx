leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      5–15 vacancy days per turn are common due to fragmented workflows
      (notice-to-vacate, scope, bids, scheduling, QA) across spreadsheets,
      email, and phone.
    - >-
      Inconsistent scoping causes budget variance of 8–20% and 10–20% rework due
      to missed items or poor sequencing.
    - >-
      Slow bidding: most PMs obtain only 1–2 quotes; first quote often arrives
      >24–48 hours after request; prices vary widely by trade and season.
    - >-
      Scheduling slips (access, dependencies, vendor no-shows) lead to 2–5
      avoidable days of idle time per turn.
    - >-
      Limited visibility for owners and executives; exceptions aren’t escalated;
      make-ready boards in PMS are static and manual.
    - >-
      Coordinator headcount doesn’t scale linearly; each FTE tops out around
      1,500–3,000 units depending on turnover rate.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated turn plan: Parse notice-to-vacate from PMS, generate line-item
      scope of work with cost and duration estimates from inspection
      photos/videos and past turn history.
    - >-
      Smart bid orchestration: Issue standardized RFQs to pre-vetted vendors by
      trade, target 3 quotes within 24 hours, apples-to-apples comparison with
      anomaly detection.
    - >-
      Calendar optimization: Sequence trades (paint → flooring → clean → punch)
      with dependency logic, buffer times, and vendor calendar sync;
      auto-reschedule on slip.
    - >-
      Field app: Mobile checklists with guided photo/video capture, AI QC to
      catch misses (e.g., wall patches, caulk lines, appliance condition).
    - >-
      Materials and POs: Auto-build materials list with SKU pricing (Home Depot
      Pro, Lowe’s Pro, Amazon Business), create POs, track delivery windows.
    - >-
      Live progress tracking: Gantt and SLA clocks; owner-facing updates;
      exception alerts when tasks exceed thresholds or budget variance >5%.
    - >-
      PMS integration: Sync unit status, work orders, and invoices with
      Yardi/AppFolio/Buildium/RealPage; update make-ready boards automatically.
    - >-
      Analytics & ROI: Days saved, on-time rate, vendor performance, budget
      variance, vacancy loss avoided; per-property, region, and portfolio
      rollups.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut 3–5 vacancy days per turn by using AI to scope, bid, schedule, and track
    make-ready across your existing vendors and PMS—producing predictable,
    on-time, on-budget unit turns with full owner visibility.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-portfolio dataset of turn costs, durations, and vendor performance by
    metro powering superior scope and scheduling predictions; deep PMS
    integrations that embed AI into existing workflows; growing vendor
    performance graph enabling faster bids and higher on-time rates; compounding
    feedback loops from inspection media and outcomes that are hard to
    replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Multifamily operators (1,000–25,000 units) using Yardi/RealPage with
      in-house vendor rosters.
    - >-
      SFR property managers (500–10,000 doors) on AppFolio/Buildium that rely on
      local vendors.
    - >-
      Regional owner-operators and small REITs needing standardization across
      markets.
    - >-
      Third-party turn vendors seeking predictable pipelines (as partners and
      secondary buyers).
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to PM firms (COO/VP Ops/Regional Maintenance Directors);
      target 1k–20k unit portfolios with AMRD >8 days.
    - >-
      PMS marketplaces: AppFolio Stack, Buildium Marketplace, RealPage Exchange,
      Yardi Interface Certified Partner listing.
    - >-
      Industry associations/events: NARPM, IREM, NMHC OPTECH; webinars with case
      studies on days saved and ROI.
    - >-
      Referral partnerships with maintenance platforms (Property Meld),
      inspection apps (HappyCo, zInspector), and procurement (Home Depot Pro).
    - >-
      Content-led growth: Turn playbooks, city-level trade rate benchmarks, and
      turn-time calculators; SEO for “reduce make-ready days.”
    - >-
      Pilot-led land-and-expand: 60–90 day paid pilots for 200–500 units/region;
      expand by region/property after ROI proof.
