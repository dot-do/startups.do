  problem:
    - >-
      AEC teams inherit PDFs/scans that must be redrawn in CAD, consuming 2–8
      hours per sheet and introducing human errors.
    - >-
      Converted DWG/DXF rarely comply with client standards (layers, linetypes,
      fonts, title blocks), causing rework and QC delays.
    - >-
      Existing PDF-to-DWG tools produce messy vectors (broken polylines, wrong
      scales, lost dimensions/hatches) and no standards mapping.
    - >-
      Large backlogs of legacy as-builts, permit sets, and O&M drawings slow
      remodels and facility handovers.
    - >-
      Outsourcing conversion is slow (2–5 day turnaround), variable quality, and
      difficult to audit for compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven vectorization that reconstructs lines, arcs, polylines, hatches,
      blocks, and dimensions from PDFs/scans at scale.
    - >-
      Standards Mapping Engine: maps detected elements to client-specific
      layers/linetypes/text styles per AIA/NCS, ISO 13567, BS 1192, or custom
      standards.
    - >-
      Title block and sheet-set recognition with automatic attribute population
      (project name, sheet number, rev, scale).
    - >-
      Symbol/block library detection and substitution (e.g., MEP symbols) with
      confidence scoring and review queue.
    - >-
      Auto-scale and units detection with tolerance checks; model/paper space
      construction and viewport setup.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA workspace to review low-confidence items, correct
      mappings, and approve in one pass.
    - >-
      Batch processing API, AutoCAD/BricsCAD plugins, and ACC/BIM
      360/Procore/SharePoint/Dropbox connectors.
    - >-
      Audit log and compliance report per sheet: accuracy metrics, unresolved
      items, standards compliance score.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy PDFs/scans into clean, standards-compliant DWG/DXF in minutes,
    not days—auto-mapped to your layers, linetypes, text styles, and title
    blocks with measurable, auditable quality.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of labeled AEC drawings linked to
    standards-compliant DWGs plus a Standards Mapping Engine that captures
    firm-specific conventions—compounded by CAD plugins embedded in daily
    workflows and white-label partnerships that competitors without standards
    expertise or distribution cannot easily replicate.
