    plans to maximize cube and meet service standards.
  targetUsers:
    - Linehaul planners
    - Network optimization
    - Terminal operations
  triggers:
    - New shipments received in TMS

  steps:
    - Normalize shipments and compute density/cube
    - Cluster by service lanes and cut-off constraints
    - Optimize trailer builds and schedules (OR-Tools)
    - Simulate ETA vs. service promises; iterate
    - 'Publish plan to TMS (routes, trailers, stops)'
    - Notify planners for approvals and exceptions
  tools:
    - 'TMS APIs (McLeod LoadMaster, TMW, MercuryGate)'
    - Google Maps/Here Distance Matrix
    - OR-Tools or Gurobi
    - Weather APIs

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Under-filled trailers (low cube/weight utilization) drive excess linehaul
      miles and trailers in motion, increasing cost per shipment by 2–8%.
    - >-
      Planners juggle thousands of constraints (cut times, service standards,
      breakbulk sort rules, equipment availability, HazMat, doubles
      restrictions) with limited time, leading to suboptimal nightly plans and
      reactive intraday decisions.
    - >-
      Intraday disruptions (late pickups, weather, breakdowns, no-shows, labor
      gaps) are handled manually; most networks lack rapid re-optimization
      within service windows.
    - >-
      Dock operations and trailer assignments are decoupled from network plans,
      creating rehandles, bottlenecks, and missed departures.
    - >-
      Existing tools are batch-oriented or generic; they don’t continuously
      learn from dock scans/ELD data or provide co‑pilot UX for planners and
      terminal managers.
    - >-
      Siloed data (TMS, telematics, dimensioners, YMS, dock systems) prevents a
      unified, actionable plan tied to service commitments and real cube
      constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Nightly optimization: generate end-to-end consolidation and linehaul plans
      (origin, breakbulk flows, trailer types, turns, stops, departure windows)
      meeting service standards.
    - >-
      Intraday re-optimization: continuous replans based on live
      pickups/deliveries, ELD position, dock scans, weather/traffic, equipment
      status; proposes minimal-change plans to protect service.
    - >-
      Trailer assignment engine: selects 28’ pups vs 48’/53’, doubles/turnpike
      doubles per state rules, weight/axle, cube, and available sets; recommends
      pool balances.
    - >-
      Dock-aware load builds: sequence freight (headload/backload), minimize
      rehandles, enforce HazMat separation, temperature/hazard constraints, and
      cut times; generate door assignments.
    - >-
      Service-standard compliance: predicts ETA and service adherence risk;
      flags at-risk shipments and proposes re-routes or escalations.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if simulations (terminal outages, late linehaul,
      volume spikes) with cost/service trade-offs and budget impact.
    - >-
      Co‑pilot UX: natural-language “ask the planner,” plan diffs, reason codes,
      and human-in-the-loop approvals; audit trail for governance.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors to TMS, ELD/telematics, dock/YMS,
      dimensioners/scales, mapping/traffic, weather; API and flat-file support.
    - >-
      Governance and safety: hard constraints for legal/union rules, equipment,
      and state-specific doubles restrictions; role-based access and SOC 2
      controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase trailer cube utilization by 2–4 percentage points, reduce linehaul
    miles per shipment by 3–6%, improve on-time performance by 0.5–1.5 points,
    and cut planning time by 50–70% via an AI co‑pilot that builds nightly and
    intraday consolidation, trailer assignments, and linehaul plans while
    honoring service standards and operational constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, LTL-specific co‑pilot that blends real-time data
    (dock scans, ELD, weather/traffic) with service-standard aware optimization
    and terminal-level playbooks; prebuilt connectors and legality/rule
    libraries cut implementation time to weeks and create switching costs.
    Privacy-preserving benchmarking across customers compounds model performance
    over time.

  character: >-
    LTL linehaul planners, terminal managers, and dispatch supervisors at
    long‑distance general freight carriers who must produce nightly and intraday
    consolidations, trailer assignments, and linehaul plans that maximize cube
    and meet service standards.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile volumes, tight cutoffs, hub schedules, and imbalanced
    flows make optimal consolidations and trailer assignments hard.

    - Internal: Planners juggle spreadsheets and tribal knowledge, leading to
    rushed, inconsistent decisions and missed opportunities.

    - Philosophical: Building the plan should be calm, data‑driven, and
    transparent—not a nightly fire drill.
  guide: >-
    We understand LTL. Built by LTL operators and data scientists, proven in
    production, and integrated with TMS, dock scans, DIM/weight, and telematics.
    Explainable recommendations, secure (SOC 2), and referenceable ROI.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: TMS, pickup/delivery, dock scans, DIM/weight, telematics,
    service maps, and constraints.

    2) Pilot: 30 days in selected terminals with side‑by‑side measurement vs.
    baseline.

    3) Rollout: Network‑wide playbooks, training, alerts, and continuous
    optimization.

    Ongoing: Nightly plans before cutoff and intraday re‑plans with trailer
    assignments, consolidations, linehaul departures, and exception watchlists.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot. Transitional: Get the
    ROI brief and sample plan outputs.
  success: |-
    - +8–15% trailer cube utilization
    - −5–12% linehaul miles/runs and fewer relays
    - +2–5 pts on‑time service and fewer missed cutoffs
    - −20–35% rehandles/damages
    - 90% faster planning cycle time
    - 100–300 bps margin lift per CWT
    - Planners focus on exceptions, not spreadsheets
  failure: >-
    Without the co‑pilot: wasted cube and empty miles, missed service, overtime
    and burnout, dock congestion and rehandles, higher cost per CWT, and
    avoidable customer churn.
