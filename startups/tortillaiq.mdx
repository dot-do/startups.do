leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Short shelf-life (7–14 days) and volatile weekly orders make SKU/DC
      forecasting hard; promotions and weather cause 15–35% WMAPE for many
      plants.
    - >-
      Schedulers spend 6–12 hours per week per plant in spreadsheets and ERP
      exports to build a feasible plan; re-plans during disruptions take 1–2
      hours, causing missed trucks.
    - >-
      Changeovers by diameter, formulation, and allergen require careful
      sequencing; poor sequencing adds 10–25% lost line time and 5–12% scrap.
    - >-
      Labor and crew constraints (mixing, line, packaging) aren’t synchronized
      with the plan, driving overtime and temp usage (2–8% extra labor cost).
    - >-
      Finished goods freshness targets and DC cutoffs aren’t optimized, yielding
      5–15% returns/write-offs and service level misses (fill rate <95%).
    - >-
      ERP/MES native APS modules are generic or underused; Excel-based planning
      lacks scenario capability, version control, and auditability.
    - >-
      Limited visibility across mixing, proofing, press/oven, cooling, and
      packaging resources causes upstream bottlenecks and downstream starvation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly SKU/DC forecasting using order history, POS/IRI-Nielsen, promo
      calendars, holidays, and local weather; bias control and WMAPE optimized
      by DC.
    - >-
      Finite production planning (1–6 weeks) across mixing, press/oven, cooling,
      and packaging, with 15–30 minute buckets; minimizes changeovers and meets
      DC ship windows.
    - >-
      Labor-aware scheduling: ensures required crews per line/shift,
      synchronizes mixing and packaging staffing, and flags overtime needs
      proactively.
    - >-
      Shelf-life and freshness optimization: aligns production timing with DC
      arrivals to reduce returns while meeting case fill SLAs.
    - >-
      Materials and allergen changeover logic: validates film, boxes,
      ingredients, and allergen cleanup times by SKU sequence.
    - >-
      Rapid re-planning: responds to rush orders, line downtime, or material
      shortages in under 5 minutes with feasible alternatives.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: compare plan alternatives for cost-to-serve, fill rate,
      and overtime; quantify trade-offs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An industry-specific AI that delivers weekly SKU/DC forecasts and converts
    them into a finite, line-level production plan that respects capacity,
    changeovers, and labor—cutting returns and overtime while raising service
    levels. Re-plan in under 5 minutes, not hours, with tortilla-specific
    constraints and integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized tortilla constraint library, pretrained SKU/DC demand models,
    and validated changeover matrices built from early customer plants enable
    faster time-to-value than generic APS/IBP tools. Integration templates for
    common ERPs and MES reduce onboarding from months to weeks. Rapid
    re-planning under 5 minutes at realistic plant scales provides a tangible
    operational edge. Domain experts from industrial bakeries embed best
    practices and trust.

  problem:
    - Volatile SKU/DC demand causes stockouts and stale inventory.
    - 'Spreadsheets can’t balance lines, changeovers, and labor in real time.'

    - Overtime and crew bottlenecks to hit service targets.
    - 'No unified view of forecast, plan, and actuals.'
    - Plans ignore shelf‑life and freshness windows.
    - What‑if analysis is slow; decisions happen too late.
  solution:
    - 'AI forecasts by SKU and DC, updated weekly and rollable to daily/shift.'
    - 'Finite, line‑level schedules across mix, press, bake, and pack.'
    - >-
