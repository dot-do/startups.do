  problem:
    - >-
      High-mix, low-volume operations lead to excessive changeovers: 20–120
      minutes per changeover depending on pigment/resin/solvent; 10–25% of
      mixer/mill time lost to avoidable changeovers and cleaning.
    - >-
      Manual/Excel-based scheduling cannot consider full constraints
      (compatibility, QA, crew qualifications, curing, inventory), resulting in
      firefighting, expediting, and overtime.
    - >-
      Color/chemistry compatibility is complex: switching between dark-to-light,
      solvent- to water-based, or UV/EB chemistries requires different cleaning
      procedures and time; tribal knowledge is hard to scale.
    - >-
      Crew and qualification constraints (e.g., only certain operators can run
      bead mills or handle UV inks) create bottlenecks and unplanned idle time.
    - >-
      WIP and inventory coupling (bases, letdowns, varnishes, solvents,
      pigments) introduces upstream constraints that most schedulers ignore,
      causing downstream stockouts and late orders.
    - >-
      Quality testing, cure/aging times, and packaging capacity are often not
      modeled, delaying release and extending cycle time by 4–24 hours.
    - >-
      Rush orders and frequent re-prioritizations cause schedule churn; typical
      plants replan 3–10 times per week, hurting schedule adherence.
    - >-
      VOC/hazardous waste and solvent usage spike with suboptimal sequencing;
      cleaning solvent use often equals 5–15% of batch volume, with disposal
      costs and EHS exposure.
    - >-
      Key performance pain: OTIF at 85–90% (vs >95% target), mixer OEE at
      45–60%, overtime >10% of labor hours, scrap/rejects 0.5–2% due to
      contamination or hold failures.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid optimization engine (constraint programming + MILP + domain
      heuristics) that sequences batches by color/chemistry to minimize cleaning
      while honoring finite capacities, crew qualifications, QA, curing, and
      packaging constraints.
    - >-
      Chemistry and color compatibility graph with a rules library (pigment
      family, resin system, solvent class, food-grade/halal/Kosher segregation)
      to compute realistic cleaning times and procedures.
    - >-
      Dynamic cleaning time estimator using past changeover history, color delta
      E, resin compatibility, and solvent selection to predict setup/clean
      durations ±10 minutes accuracy after calibration.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling across mixers, mills, QA labs, curing/aging,
      and packaging lines; includes queue times and shared resource constraints
      (e.g., wash stations).
    - >-
      Crew/shift optimizer with qualification matrix, cross-training
      preferences, overtime caps, and union rules.
    - >-
      Inventory- and lot-sizing-aware scheduling that respects base/letdown
      availability, minimum/maximum batch sizes, and raw material arrival dates;
      reduces WIP days by 10–20%.
    - >-
      Fast re-optimization to handle rush orders or asset downtime with schedule
      stability controls (lock levels) to minimize disruption.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if simulation: compare policies (light-to-dark
      vs dark-to-light, fewer larger batches vs more frequent changeovers) with
      KPIs for solvent use, OTIF, and labor hours.
    - >-
      ERP/MES connectors (SAP ECC/S4, QAD, Deacom, MS Dynamics, Epicor) for
      orders, BOMs, routings, inventory, and confirmations; shop-floor dispatch
      interface and APIs/webhooks.
    - >-
      6-week implementation playbook: data mapping (2 weeks), time studies and
      rule calibration (1–2 weeks), model training and UAT (2 weeks), go-live
      and training (1 week).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-optimal, chemistry-aware production schedules that increase mixer/mill
    throughput 10–20%, cut changeover/cleaning time 20–35%, reduce solvent usage
    15–30%, and lift OTIF to >95%—implemented and integrated with ERP/MES in
    under 6 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific compatibility and cleaning-time library for
    pigments/resins/solvents in ink manufacturing—validated by time
    studies—combined with prebuilt ERP connectors and a solver tuned for ink
    workflows. This shortens implementation to <6 weeks and delivers measurable
