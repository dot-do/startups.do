leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, multi-touch processes to request, chase, and validate payoff
      statements and HOA estoppels delay closings (days to weeks) and inflate
      labor costs.
    - >-
      High error and fraud exposure: spoofed payoff letters, stale
      per-diem/fees, incorrect beneficiary details, and HOA balance changes lead
      to post-closing cures and financial loss.
    - >-
      Fragmented ecosystem: thousands of mortgage servicers, sub-servicers, and
      HOA/COA management companies with inconsistent portals, forms, fees, and
      statutory timelines.
    - >-
      Poor visibility and control: limited SLAs, no standardized audit trail,
      and little forecasting of turnaround times; managers can’t proactively
      unblock files.
    - >-
      Inefficient fee handling: HOA estoppel fee prepayments, reimbursements,
      and ledger entries create reconciliation work and accounting risk.
    - >-
      Compliance friction: GLBA/ALTA Pillar 3 requirements, vendor management,
      SOC 2 expectations, TCPA rules for outreach, and PII handling slow down
      adoption and scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with your title production system (SoftPro, Resware, RamQuest,
      Qualia) to auto-detect when a payoff/HOA request is needed and prefill
      requests from file data.
    - >-
      Capture borrower/seller authorizations via embedded eSign; collect
      HOA/servicer-specific forms dynamically and route via compliant channels
      (portal, email, fax, mail).
    - >-
      AI-driven outreach engine selects the best contact method from a verified
      directory of servicers/HOAs; automates follow-ups, reminders, and
      escalation to meet SLAs/statutory timelines.
    - >-
      Document AI extracts and validates payoff/estoppel data (per diem, fees,
      wire instructions, beneficiary, assessment balances); cross-checks against
      servicer/HOA references and known-fraud patterns.
    - >-
      Funding reconciliation: auto-recalculate at disbursement (per diem to
      funding date), compare to final statement, flag variances, and post ledger
      entries back to TPS; auto-generate seller/borrower credits/debits.
    - >-
      HOA fee handling: pay on your behalf via virtual card/ACH with
      programmatic receipts; allocate to file ledger and support reimbursement
      workflows.
    - >-
      Real-time dashboards: predicted turnaround time, exception queues, SLA
      risk alerts, and workload forecasting per office/team.
    - >-
      Full compliance trail: immutable timeline of requests, consents,
      communications, documents, and approvals mapped to ALTA Best Practices.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI agent purpose-built for title operations that automates ordering,
    validation, and reconciliation of lender payoffs and HOA
    estoppels—integrated to your TPS—cutting cycle time 30–50%, reducing staff
    touches 60–80%, and lowering post-closing cure rates 50%+. Fraud checks,
    statutory deadline tracking, and end-to-end audit trails de-risk funding.
    ROI guarantee: if we don’t reduce total file cost by ≥20% in 90 days, you
    don’t pay the platform fee.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    At-scale, verified servicer/HOA directory and channel-optimization graph
    (calls, portals, emails, faxes) tied to measured SLAs; end-to-end TPS
    writeback and reconciliation that competitors and internal teams struggle to
    replicate. Compounded data network effects improve turnaround predictions,
    fraud detection, and playbook efficacy with each order. Enterprise-grade
    compliance (SOC 2/GLBA/ALTA) reduces vendor risk friction.
