  problem:
    - >-
      Visual weld inspection (VT) on plate work is labor-intensive and
      inconsistent; inspectors spend 20–40% of time walking the floor or
      traveling between sites to assess relatively simple welds.
    - >-
      Measurement of weld bead geometry (e.g., fillet leg length, throat,
      reinforcement, bead width) is often done with gauges and varies by
      inspector; re-measure/rework due to measurement variability can add 3–8%
      cost to weld-related labor.
    - >-
      QC backlogs delay production; photos are already taken for traceability
      but are unstandardized and not reliably actionable for accept/reject
      triage.
    - >-
      Many shops lack structured, searchable weld QC data linked to
      WPS/standards (AWS D1.1, ISO 5817, ASME IX), making audits and root-cause
      analysis slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Remote sites, field work, and shift work create coverage gaps for CWIs/QA
      managers; minor issues wait hours or days for review.
    - >-
      Existing automated inspection options (3D scanners, inline laser systems)
      are too expensive/complex for small/medium fabricators and don’t fit
      manual/low-volume workflows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Capture: Mobile app-guided, standardized photo sets (5–8 angles) using a
      low-cost calibration/scale tag and lighting guidance.
    - >-
      Analyze: Cloud or on-prem AI that measures bead geometry (e.g., fillet leg
      lengths, throat estimate, reinforcement, width) and flags visual defects
      (porosity, undercut/overlap indicators, tie-in/undercut surface cues,
      spatter, excessive reinforcement, incomplete fill at surface).
    - >-
      Decide: Auto-compare to WPS or standard (AWS D1.1, ISO 5817 class B/C/D,
      ASME IX) to return Accept / Monitor / Refer-to-inspector decisions with
      rationale and annotated images.
    - >-
      Triage workflow: Web dashboard for queueing, bulk review, escalation to
      human inspectors, and auto-generated audit-ready reports tied to heat/lot,
      welder ID, and job/part.
    - >-
      Integrations: API and connectors for MES/ERP/PLM (e.g., JobBOSS, ProShop,
      SAP), welding management software (WPS libraries), and storage/Vault.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Optional remote CWI verification for borderline or
      critical weld classes within SLA windows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Standards-driven weld QC from standardized photos: accurate bead
    measurements and visual defect detection in under 60 seconds, triaging
    60–80% of welds remotely, cutting on-site inspection hours by 30–50% and
    rework from measurement variability by 10–20% within 90 days—without
    specialized cameras.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Standards-calibrated measurement from low-cost photo sets backed by
    proprietary multi-view datasets and third-party CWI validation, plus a
    physical calibration kit that ensures repeatability and creates switching
    costs via historical quality records and WPS-linked acceptance libraries.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plate‑work fabrication leaders (QA managers, welding supervisors, supplier
    quality engineers) who must guarantee weld quality at speed and scale, often
    across multiple sites and suppliers.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual visual inspection is slow, subjective, and travel‑heavy;
    bead measurements lack consistency and traceability. Internal: Pressure to
    hit deadlines without risking quality or reputation; they can’t be
    everywhere at once. Philosophical: Weld quality shouldn’t depend on who is
    on shift or where the part was made.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the pain of subjective calls, NCRs, and costly rework.
    Authority: Our AI measures weld beads and detects defects from standardized
    photo sets, trained on thousands of annotated welds; aligned to ISO
    5817/ASME acceptance criteria; pilots show 25–40% less rework and 60–80%
    faster inspections.
  plan: >-
    1) Standardize capture: use our photo templates/targets with a phone or
    industrial camera. 2) Upload/API: send sets; auto‑check completeness and
    metadata. 3) Review & act: receive dimensioned measurements, defect tags,
    and pass/fail triage with full audit trail; integrate to QMS/MES. Assurance:
    data security (on‑prem/private cloud), human‑in‑the‑loop overrides, start
    with limited‑scope pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 2‑week pilot on one weld class or line. Transitional: Book a
    30‑minute demo and get a sample report + ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Objective, consistent weld QC across shifts and suppliers; remote triage
    without travel; early defect detection; 30–50% less rework; faster approvals
    and throughput; clear, auditable measurement evidence; on‑time delivery and
    happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Missed or late defect discovery; inconsistent, un‑auditable inspections;
    schedule slips and expensive rework; failed customer audits, chargebacks,
    and damaged reputation.

  problem:
    - 'Manual weld inspection is slow, subjective, and hard to scale.'
    - Travel and on-site checks delay throughput and tie up experts.
    - Inconsistent photo capture leads to inconsistent measurements and rework.
    - >-
      Critical metrics (bead width, leg length, throat) aren’t measured
      consistently against WPS.
    - Defects are found late; triage happens after parts move downstream.
    - >-
      Documentation and traceability are scattered across photos and
      spreadsheets.
    - Customers demand standard-aligned evidence; audit prep is painful.
  solution:
    - Standardize photo capture and let AI measure every weld consistently.
    - Automatic defect detection with pass/fail against your tolerances and WPS.
    - Remote triage dashboard to prioritize issues and reduce on-site visits.
    - Instant reports with objective measurements and annotated images.
    - >-

      spatter.
    - >-
      Rule engine: per-process tolerances by joint type, material, and
      thickness.
    - Batch processing at line speed; results in minutes.
    - Triage queue with severity scoring and auto-routing.
