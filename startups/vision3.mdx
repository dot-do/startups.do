  problem:
    - >-
      Manual QC for roasted nuts and peanut butter (PB) relies on visual
      inspection and simple AQL sampling, leading to inconsistent grading,
      missed defects, and rework.
    - >-
      Inline optical sorters catch many issues pre- or mid-process but don’t
      verify final, packaged, or post-roast quality by lot; settings drift
      without feedback loops.
    - >-
      Plants lack fast, standardized, and auditable photo-based checks at
      receiving, post-roast, and pre-pack that tie to COA/specs.
    - >-
      Quality managers struggle to quantify defect rates (scorch/under-roast,
      broken pieces, foreign matter, size grade) and correlate them to process
      parameters in near real time.
    - >-
      Documentation for audits (FSMA/HACCP/GFSI) is manual, fragmented, and hard
      to retrieve; traceability of visual checks is weak.
    - >-
      Labor constraints make frequent checks impractical; current checks take
      5–10 minutes/lot and vary by operator.
    - >-
      Incoming supplier variability (variety, moisture, roast curve) drives
      taste/texture issues in PB; lack of early grading increases scrap and
      blending complexity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Standardized capture: A low-cost tray jig and calibration card guide
      operators via a smartphone app to capture consistent photos under ambient
      or LED light.
    - >-
      AI inference: Cloud or on-device models quantify scorch/under-roast,
      broken piece ratio, foreign matter presence, size distribution/grade, and
      color histogram vs spec.
    - >-
      Immediate decisions: Pass/fail per spec, trend charts, and alerts connect
      to sampling plans (ANSI/ASQ Z1.4-like), with configurable lot acceptance
      rules.
    - >-
      Process feedback: Correlate defect trends with roast time/temp, air flow,
      and grinder settings via MES/ERP integration; alert on drift.
    - >-
      Traceability: Immutable, timestamped inspection records with operator ID,
      lot/line, and attachments for audits and customer COAs.
    - >-
      Model adaptation: Variety- and product-specific models (e.g., Valencia
      peanuts, whole vs splits, dry vs oil roast) refined with plant feedback.
    - >-
      Security/deployment: Multi-tenant SaaS or private VPC; offline capture
      with queued sync; MDM support for shared devices.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Smartphone-driven, standardized tray-photo inspections that deliver lab-like
    defect and grade scoring in under 90 seconds, closing the gap between inline
    sorting and final COA verification—at a fraction of the cost of benchtop
    vision systems and with audit-ready traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A defensible, cross-plant dataset of standardized tray images and labeled
    defects tied to real outcomes, combined with calibration hardware and SOPs
    that make commodity smartphones reliably comparable to benchtop systems—plus
    OEM and ERP integrations that embed us in daily QA workflows.

  character: >-
    QA managers and line operators at roasted nuts and peanut butter plants who
    need fast, objective defect detection and grade scoring from standardized
    tray photos.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Manual, subjective visual checks that vary by person and shift

    - External: Missed scorch/under-roast, broken pieces, foreign matter, and
    inconsistent size grading slow releases

    - Internal: Teams doubt their calls, debate grades, and dread audits

    - Philosophical: Food quality and safety shouldn’t depend on tired eyes or
    guesswork
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know high-speed lines, variable lighting, and staffing changes
    make consistent visual QC hard

    - Authority: Built with food QC experts and trained on thousands of
    annotated tray images; designed for standardized tray photo workflows
  plan: |-
    Process Plan:
      1) Snap a standardized tray photo with a smartphone
      2) Upload to Vision QC; AI flags defects and assigns size grade in seconds
      3) Review results, export a report, or push to existing QC/MES/ERP systems
    Agreement Plan:
      - Clear, per-site or per-image pricing; start with a pilot
      - Uses your existing phones and a simple lightbox/tray SOP
      - Cancel anytime; your data remains yours
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 2-week pilot
    - Transitional: Download a sample QC report and the tray photo SOP checklist
  success: |-
    - Consistent, objective grading across shifts and sites
    - Faster release decisions with fewer reworks and holds
    - Traceable QC records that simplify audits
    - Early detection of roasting drift and contamination risks
    - Higher yield, fewer complaints, and stronger customer trust
  failure: |-
    - Quality drift goes unnoticed, causing rework, chargebacks, or worse
    - Inconsistent grading leads to disputes and wasted product
    - Audit exposure from incomplete or subjective records
    - Slower throughput and missed delivery targets
