  problem:
    - >-
      Bakery owners lack time and expertise to monitor and respond to reviews
      across Google, Yelp, and Facebook, leading to delayed or inconsistent
      replies.
    - >-
      Negative or unaddressed reviews harm local SEO and walk-in traffic; one
      1-star review on the front page can reduce conversion by 5–10%.
    - >-
      Owners struggle to triage truly critical issues (e.g., allergens, food
      safety, wedding/catering failures) that require immediate escalation and
      offline resolution.
    - >-
      Generic, templated responses feel insincere; staff don’t know how to
      personalize at scale while adhering to platform policies (e.g., Yelp’s
      no-incentives rule).
    - >-
      No clear measurement loop exists tying review management to outcomes
      (rating improvement, ticket size, repeat visits).
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-platform monitoring for Google Business Profile, Yelp, and Facebook
      reviews, messages, and Q&A with near real-time alerts.
    - >-
      AI-drafted, bakery-specific, personalized responses with brand voice
      profiles; one-click approve and post (auto-post for Google/Facebook where
      API allows, guided paste for Yelp).

      Critical-issue detection (allergens, food safety, wedding/catering
      failures, refund demands) with SMS/Slack escalation and step-by-step
      playbooks.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails to avoid disallowed practices (e.g., incentives for
      reviews) and platform-specific nuances (Yelp no auto-post,
      sentiment-sensitive language).
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard linking response time, coverage, sentiment shifts, and
      rating trends; weekly digest and actionable tasks.
    - >-
