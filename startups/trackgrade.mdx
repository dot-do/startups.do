  problem:
    - >-
      Instructors spend 10–20 minutes per sortie manually scrubbing track logs
      to discuss deviations. At $60–$100/hr instructor cost, that’s $10–$30 per
      flight. For a 40‑aircraft school flying 1,000 sorties/month, debrief
      review time alone costs $10k–$30k/month.
    - >-
      No objective, standardized scoring against FAA ACS tolerances; grading is
      inconsistent across CFIs, complicating stage checks and checkride
      readiness assessments.
    - >-
      Flight data is fragmented (ForeFlight, Garmin Pilot, G1000 logs,
      Redbird/Frasca/ALSIM, X‑Plane/MSFS), making cross‑platform analysis and
      longitudinal progress tracking difficult.
    - >-
      Part 141 quality assurance and record‑keeping require documented
      proficiency evidence. Manual gradebooks often lack traceability to raw
      data, risking audit friction.
    - >-
      Students lack immediate, actionable feedback mapped to specific ACS tasks
      (e.g., steep turns, stalls, holds, approaches), slowing skill acquisition
      and reducing motivation.
    - >-
      School leaders have limited visibility into instructor effectiveness,
      syllabus bottlenecks, and maneuver pass/fail hotspots across cohorts and
      fleets.
    - >-
      Real-time safety insights (e.g., unstabilized approaches) are missed until
      after events; early trend detection could prevent repeat deficiencies.
    - >-
      Liability and privacy concerns demand secure handling of PII and flight
      data; most DIY workflows aren’t compliant or auditable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal ingestion: one-click import from ForeFlight/garmin logs and
      direct connectors for Redbird/Frasca/ALSIM, plus GPX/KML/CSV/JSON; desktop
      plug‑ins for X‑Plane/MSFS/Prepar3D.
    - >-
      Maneuver detection engine: automatically segments flights
      (takeoff/landing, steep turns, stalls, slow flight, holds,
      intercept/track, approaches, unusual attitudes, ground reference) using
      sensor fusion and geofencing.
    - >-
      ACS‑aligned scoring: computes tolerance compliance (e.g., altitude ±100
      ft, heading ±10°, airspeed ±10 kt; CDI/GS deflection; timing ±10 s) and
      outputs task‑level pass/fail with confidence.
    - >-
      Visual debrief: 2D/3D track, deviation heatmaps, trend timelines,
      stability gates (e.g., 1,000’ AGL IFR/500’ VFR), and maneuver‑specific
      overlays with annotated events.
    - >-
      Curriculum mapping and gradebook: links flight segments to lesson
      objectives (Part 141 syllabi or custom), auto‑populates grades, flags
      remediation items, and exports to LMS.
    - >-
      Progress analytics: student/instructor/squadron dashboards; cohort
      comparisons; early‑warning alerts for repeated deficiencies (e.g.,
      localizer tracking).
    - >-
      Compliance & audit: immutable scorecards with raw‑data traceability;
      role‑based access; PII redaction; secure sharing for stage checks and
      internal QA.
    - >-
      APIs & SDK: integration endpoints for EFBs, sim vendors, and school
      systems; webhooks for automatic ingestion post‑flight.
    - >-
      Note: Training aid only—intended to support, not replace, instructor
      judgment or DPE evaluation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Upload sim or real‑flight logs and get an ACS‑aligned scorecard and visual
    debrief in under 60 seconds—standardizing instruction, cutting debrief time
    by 50%, and improving stage‑check and checkride pass rates with auditable
    data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    ACS‑first scoring engine with validated maneuver detection across both sim
    and aircraft data sources, plus deep LMS/gradebook integration and
    documented outcome improvements from design‑partner schools. The combination
    of cross‑platform ingestion, proprietary labeled datasets, and auditable ACS
    mappings creates switching costs and defensibility.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Flight students, CFIs, and training managers who want fast, objective,
    ACS‑aligned debriefs that turn raw track logs into clear next steps.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual, inconsistent debriefs and spreadsheets waste time and miss
    errors in sim and real flights. Internal: Uncertainty about checkride
    readiness and what to fix next. Philosophical: Performance should be
    measured objectively against the FAA ACS, not opinions.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’re pilots and CFIs who know checkride pressure and messy data.
    Authority: Built by aviation pros, aligned to FAA ACS tolerances, integrates
    with common sim/EFB logs, and delivers consistent, evidence-based scoring.
  plan: >-
    Simple 3-step plan: 1) Upload sim or flight track logs. 2) AI auto-scores
    maneuvers vs ACS tolerances and generates a visual debrief with deviations
    and trends. 3) Review, assign targeted reps, re-fly, and track improvement.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial and upload a log now. Transitional: Book a
    15‑minute demo or explore a sample debrief.
  success: >-
    Objective, repeatable scoring; faster path to proficiency; fewer hours to
    checkride; standardized instruction across CFIs; clear trend tracking by
    maneuver; sharable reports for students, instructors, and QA.
  failure: >-
    Without it: wasted hours, subjective grading, repeated errors, missed safety
    trends, blown budgets and timelines, and higher risk of checkride busts.
