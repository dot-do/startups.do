leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual SDS authoring for film, paper, plate, photochemical, and toner
      products is slow (2–6 weeks per SDS set), expensive ($150–$800 per SDS per
      region), and error-prone, especially for mixture calculations and
      transport classifications.
    - >-
      Frequent formulation tweaks, regional regulatory divergence (OSHA HazCom
      2012, EU CLP/REACH, UK REACH, GHS variations, Canada WHMIS, Japan
      ISHL/PRTR) and translation requirements create continuous backlog and
      compliance risk.
    - >-
      EHS teams struggle to consolidate formulation and test data (LIMS,
      PLM/ERP, QC labs) into structured SDS sections; data gaps and version
      control issues lead to rework and audit friction.
    - >-
      Generic AI tools lack regulatory logic, traceability, and audit trails;
      traditional SDS tools still demand heavy manual input and lengthy
      implementations.
    - >-
      Imaging-specific needs (silver halide, solvent systems, photoinitiators,
      resins, pigments, toners, plate developers) aren’t well covered by generic
      authoring templates and phrase libraries.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion: secure connectors and templates to pull composition,
      impurities, physical data (pH, FP, density, VOC), toxicology, ecotox, and
      transport tests from PLM/LIMS/ERP and lab reports.
    - >-
      Automated classification: rules + AI for mixture classification per
      GHS/CLP additivity, bridging principles, concentration limits, and
      cut-offs; calculates label elements, H/P statements, pictograms,
      HMIS/NFPA, VOC, and transport (UN number, ADR/IMDG/IATA) proposals.
    - >-
      Drafting engine: auto-populates SDS sections 1–16 using verified phrase
      libraries tuned for imaging/toner use cases; handles trade-secret masking
      and regional variations.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: EHS experts validate classifications, phrases,
      exposure scenarios, and transport entries; redlining and approval workflow
      with e-signatures and audit log.
    - >-
      Localization and distribution: multi-language generation with translation
      memory and terminology control; export to PDF/Word/XML; API to push SDS to
      ERP/e-commerce; versioning and change control.
    - >-
      Compliance monitoring: rule library updates tied to regulatory changes
      (e.g., ATPs to CLP, SVHC updates, Prop 65); prompts for reclassification
      where relevant.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate compliant, traceable SDS drafts from your formulation and test data
    in hours—not weeks—optimized for imaging and toner chemistries, with
    built‑in regulatory logic and human expert review before publication.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Imaging- and toner-specific regulatory content, templates, and training data
    combined with a human reviewer bench specialized in these chemistries;
    explainable classification with audit trails integrated to customer
    PLM/LIMS—reducing cycle time reliably while satisfying audit requirements
    that generic AI or generic SDS tools cannot.
