leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Missed revenue from slow/no response: 30–50% of inquiries arrive after
      hours; many bakeries respond >12 hours later or not at all, leading to
      15–25% lost opportunities.
    - >-
      High admin burden: Owners/managers spend 10–20 hours/week on
      back-and-forth DMs, phone calls, quote building, and payment collection.
    - >-
      Inconsistent quoting and errors: Manual pricing leads to 5–10% price
      leakage and occasional order mistakes (allergens, portion counts, pickup
      times).
    - >-
      Deposit and no‑show risk: Lack of streamlined deposit process causes
      10–20% of quotes to stall and 3–7% no-shows/late cancellations.
    - >-
      Fragmented channels: Inquiries come via Instagram DMs, WhatsApp, email,
      website forms, and phone with no unified pipeline or follow-ups.
    - >-
      Poor production planning: Orders aren’t consolidated into precise kitchen
      prep sheets by date/station, creating last‑minute rushes and overtime.
    - >-
      Limited analytics: No simple way to measure inquiry volume, conversion,
      AOV, channel performance, or staff time saved.
    - >-
      Seasonality stress: Holidays/wedding season spikes overwhelm staff;
      inquiry backlogs lead to customer churn.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel AI agent for website chat, WhatsApp, SMS, and Instagram DMs
      that captures event details (date, headcount, budget, allergens),
      recommends SKUs/combos, and drafts itemized quotes in minutes.
    - >-
      Automated deposit collection via secure payment links (Apple Pay/Google
      Pay/cards), with configurable deposit rules (fixed or %), tax, and service
      fees.
    - >-
      Capacity-aware quoting: checks lead time, blackout dates, kitchen
      capacity, and pickup/delivery windows before confirming availability.
    - >-
      Smart follow-ups: nudges prospects at 24/72 hours, abandons, and key
      deadlines; resumes conversations across channels with full context.
    - >-
      Kitchen prep sheet generation: aggregates confirmed orders by day/station
      (bake, decorate, pack), with SKUs, quantities, allergens, run-of-show, and
      labels; exports to PDF/CSV and prints to kitchen printers.
    - >-
      CRM-lite pipeline: track inquiry → quote → deposit → confirmed →
      fulfilled; segment by channel, event type, and AOV.
    - >-
      Integrations with POS/payments (e.g., Square/Stripe/Toast/Shopify
      POS/Lightspeed/Clover), calendars, and printing; syncs items, prices,
      taxes, and customers.
    - >-
      Policy & allergen compliance: enforces store policies (lead times,
      cancellation windows), confirms allergen disclaimers, and stores consent
      logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Convert more inquiries into paid orders while you sleep: an AI concierge
    that qualifies, quotes, secures deposits, and generates error‑free prep
    sheets—boosting conversion 20–40%, saving 10–15 admin hours/week, and
    reducing no‑shows by 70%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized conversational and quoting engine trained on bakery
    menus, portioning logic, decor complexity, and capacity constraints—paired
    with deep POS/payment/messaging integrations and production-grade prep sheet
    generation. Accruing proprietary data on inquiry→order outcomes enables
    continual conversion optimization that generic chatbots and form tools can’t
    match.
