leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Rule changes are constant and high-risk: PBMs and TPAs push weekly
      benefit, accumulator, formulary, and step-therapy updates;
      annual/quarterly CMS and state mandates; and version upgrades (e.g., NCPDP
      Telecom F2, X12 5010/7030). Each change risks regressions across thousands
      of rule paths.
    - >-
      Manual test-claim creation is slow and incomplete: typical teams create
      200–2,000 scenarios per cycle and cover <30% of rule paths, leaving blind
      spots in accumulators, coordination of benefits, compound claims, DAW/PA
      codes, and edge cases.
    - >-
      Production defects are expensive: escaped defects trigger claim
      reversals/reprocessing, member/provider abrasion, and potential penalties.
      A single high-severity defect can cost $250k–$2M in rework and
      concessions.
    - >-
      Environment drift and adjudicator variance: test vs. prod configuration
      mismatches invalidate results; vendors/platforms differ in interpretation
      of edits, NCPDP fields, and pricing logic.
    - >-
      Audit and compliance burden: evidence of rule testing and traceability is
      required (CMS Part D, state DOI audits, SOC 2/HITRUST). Manual
      documentation adds 1–3 FTEs per change window.
    - >-
      PHI constraints: using production claims for testing introduces HIPAA
      risk; synthetic data quality is often insufficient to exercise complex
      rules.
    - >-
      Performance uncertainty: new rule sets can degrade adjudication
      throughput. Few teams conduct realistic load and concurrency regression
      alongside functional tests.
  solution:
    - >-
      Coverage-driven synthetic claim generation: ML + domain rules to
      synthesize pharmacy (NCPDP Telecom D.0/F2) and medical (X12 837/835)
      claims, targeting specific rule paths, edge cases, and historical defect
      patterns.
    - >-
      Adjudicator execution harness: secure connectors to common PBM and TPA
      adjudication platforms; orchestrates parallel runs, environment
      synchronization, and idempotent replay.
    - >-
      Automated diff and impact analysis: compares baseline vs. new rule sets;
      flags financial, clinical, and messaging deltas; ranks by severity, member
      impact, and regulatory sensitivity.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit pack: auto-generated test evidence (traceability,
      screenshots, payloads, adjudication responses, approvals) mapped to
      CMS/state audit controls and internal SDLC gates.
    - >-
      Performance regression and capacity tests: simulates realistic mix/volume
      to detect throughput degradation and queueing hotspots post-change.
    - >-
      Governance and explainability: each synthetic claim is explainable (why
      generated, which rule path/edits targeted, expected vs. actual outcomes),
      with full versioning and rollbacks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-generated, regulation-aware synthetic claim suites that achieve >90%
    rule-path coverage in hours, executed against your test adjudicator(s) with
    automated impact analysis, so you ship rule changes 5–10x faster with 50–70%
    fewer escaped defects—and have audit-ready evidence by default.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned generative engine and coverage ontology built from real-world
    PBM/TPA defect corpora and regulatory deltas, plus pre-built connectors to
    leading adjudication platforms and a growing golden-baseline
    library—creating a data and network effect competitors without this vertical
    focus cannot quickly replicate.

  character: >-
    Claims operations, QA, and product leaders at PBMs and TPAs who must ship
    frequent rule changes (formularies, accumulators, pricing, eligibility)
    without breaking adjudication.
  problem: >-
    Constant rule changes and complex interactions make manual regression slow
    and incomplete; leaders fear defects in production, audit findings, and
    delayed launches—members and plan sponsors deserve accurate, timely
    decisions every time.
  guide: >-
    We understand adjudication complexity and audit pressure; our team has
    shipped large PBM/TPA platforms and built an AI engine that safely generates
    PHI-free synthetic claims, exercises your rules, and pinpoints impacts with
    clear, audit-ready evidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your test adjudicator and import rule catalogs/benefit designs;
    2) Auto-generate targeted synthetic and regression claims with expected
    outcomes; 3) Execute tests and receive impact/defect reports; 4) (Optional)
    Integrate into CI/CD and dashboards.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a 2-week pilot in your test environment.
    Transitional: Request a sample impact report and coverage map.
  success: >-
    Confident, faster releases with broader coverage; fewer production defects;
    clear impact visibility; audit-ready traceability; PHI-safe testing; happier
    clients, sponsors, and members.
  failure: >-
    Manual spot checks miss edge cases; rule collisions slip to production;
    rework, SLA hits, potential penalties, lost trust, and delayed benefit/rule
    launches.

  problem:
    - >-
      Rule changes create hidden regressions across benefit designs and plan
      years.
    - Manual test claims miss edge cases; coverage decays over time.
    - No clear line-of-sight to financial impact of rule edits.
    - Environment drift causes unexplained adjudication differences.
    - 'Test data is scarce, sensitive, and hard to maintain.'
    - Fragmented spreadsheets slow audits and approvals.
    - Releases stall without automated gates in CI/CD.
    - Root cause analysis is tedious across versions and vendors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Auto-generate synthetic and masked test claims that mirror real
      utilization.
    - >-
      Execute at scale against your test adjudicator; compare to golden
      baselines.
    - 'Quantify payment deltas, denials, and accumulator impacts per rule change.'
    - Surface regressions and configuration drift with explainable diffs.
    - >-
      Maintain living regression suites mapped to rules, formularies, and plan
      years.
    - Integrate with CI/CD to block risky releases.
    - Produce audit-ready evidence with full traceability.
  features:
    - >-
      Coverage-guided AI claim generator (NDCs, quantities, days supply, DAW,
      DUR/edits, prior auth, accumulators).
    - >-
      Scenario libraries for specialty, retail/mail, network tiers, step
      therapy, formulary changes.
    - >-
      Versioned baselines by benefit, plan, and rule set; change history
      preserved.
    - >-
      Side-by-side adjudication diff: allowed/paid, copay/coinsurance,
      accumulators, edits, messages.
    - 'Impact analytics: affected members/claims, $ exposure, trend by rule.'
    - >-
      Defect clustering and suggested root causes (rule, configuration,
      reference data).
    - >-
      Environment drift checks for formularies, fee schedules, and reference
      tables.
    - >-
      Secure by design: synthetic-first, PHI minimization, encryption, RBAC,
      audit logs.
    - Adapters for major PBM/TPA engines; REST/SFTP APIs and webhooks.
    - Exportable evidence packs for audits and approvals.
  steps:
    - Connect your test adjudicator and rules/config repositories.
    - 'Select plans, plan years, and rule packages to validate.'
    - Generate or import a regression suite; set coverage targets.
    - Run tests and compare to baselines or expected results.
    - Review impact and defect reports; assign fixes and re-run.
    - Gate releases via CI/CD and monitor ongoing rule changes.
