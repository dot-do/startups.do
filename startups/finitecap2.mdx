  problem:
    - >-
      Plants struggle to create feasible, line-level schedules that honor EPS
      bead aging windows (min/max hours) and silo capacities while meeting due
      dates.
    - >-
      Frequent press and mold changeovers drive downtime (10–30% of press
      hours), scrap, and energy spikes, especially with short runs and high SKU
      mix.
    - >-
      Manual or spreadsheet scheduling cannot model finite capacity across
      pre-expansion, silos, molding, and cutting, causing bottlenecks,
      starvation/overflows, and aging violations.
    - >-
      Lack of real-time re-planning when orders change leads to late jobs,
      expedited freight, and premium labor shifts.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into energy/steam demand, leading to avoidable peak
      loads and higher cost per m3 of foam.
    - >-
      Generic APS tools lack EPS-specific constraints (bead grades, silo aging
      windows, steam/air, mold warm-up) and take months to parameterize.
  solution:
    - >-
      Create a digital twin of the plant: pre-expanders, silo capacities by bead
      grade, min/max aging windows, press/mold catalog, cutting lines, shift
      calendars, maintenance, QC holds.
    - >-
      Use a hybrid optimizer (constraint programming + MILP + domain heuristics)
      to generate day/shift schedules with finite capacity from ERP orders and
      inventory.
    - >-
      Optimize for objectives: minimize changeovers and steam peaks, maximize
      OTIF and press utilization, respect aging/silo constraints, and reduce WIP
      and scrap.
    - >-
      Real-time re-planning on events: rush orders, machine downtime, quality
      holds, bead lot delays; produce updated sequence with minimal disruption.
    - >-
      Provide what-if scenarios: add shift, swap mold, defer order, change bead
      grade; quantify OTIF, changeover hours, and energy impact before
      committing.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration with MES/PLC: dispatch to operators, capture
      actuals, compute schedule adherence, and auto-learn better parameters
      (true changeover times, cycle rates).
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Foam plant production planners and operations leaders at polystyrene
    manufacturers who need reliable, constraint-aware schedules across
    pre-expansion, bead aging, molding, and cutting.
  problem: >-
    Spreadsheets and generic APS ignore bead aging windows, silo capacity,
    press/cutter calendars, and mold/tooling changeovers—plans unravel daily;
    planners firefight; customers wait. Scheduling foam shouldn’t be guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Finite-Capacity Production Scheduler is an AI service built for polystyrene
    foam. We understand pre-expansion and aging physics and the realities of
    silos, presses, and cutters, and we’ve implemented line-level optimizers in
    foam plants.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MES data (orders, routings, silos, molds, shifts). 2)
    Configure constraints and objectives (aging times, silo/press/cutter
    capacities, changeover matrix, tooling, maintenance). 3) Auto-generate and
    simulate a finite-capacity schedule. 4) Review, approve, and dispatch to the
    floor; re-optimize in minutes as conditions change.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 2-week pilot on your data.
  success: >-
    A stable, hour-by-hour plan from pre-expansion through cutting; fewer
    changeovers; balanced silos; higher throughput and on-time delivery; less
    overtime and WIP; lower steam/energy use; confident planners and happier
    customers.
  failure: >-
    Without it: over/under-aged beads, silo jams, idle or starved presses,
    excessive changeovers, overtime and expediting, missed due dates, and
    eroding customer trust.

  problem:
    - >-
      Spreadsheets can’t juggle bead aging, silo capacity, press calendars, and
      mold changes.
    - Changeovers (density/color/mold) burn hours and drive missed ship dates.
    - 'Beads not fully aged cause stops, scrap, and customer complaints.'
    - >-
      Silos get blocked with the wrong bead; pre-expansion runs out of sync with
      molding.
    - Rush orders and downtime force constant firefighting.
    - 'Plans don’t flow across stages, creating excess WIP and idle presses.'
    - Poor visibility of true capacity leads to overpromising and overtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Generate a finite-capacity schedule that synchronizes Pre-Expansion →
      Aging → Molding/Cutting.
    - Sequence by density/color/mold to minimize changeovers and cleaning.
    - Enforce product-specific bead aging windows with smart silo assignment.
    - >-
      Balance loads across presses, molds, and cutting lines while honoring
      shifts and maintenance.
    - Re-plan in seconds when orders change or equipment goes down.

      Run what-if scenarios to commit realistic dates and optimize
      cost-to-serve.
  features:
    - >-
      Stage-to-stage orchestration: pre-expander, aging silos, block molding
      presses, cutting lines.
    - >-
      Bead aging intelligence: product-specific times, earliest-use enforcement,
      lot tracking.
    - >-
      Silo allocation: capacity limits, contamination rules, color/density
      segregation.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent setups: matrix-driven times for density, color, mold,
      and tooling.
    - >-
      Press and mold calendars: availability, warm-up, maintenance, and crew
      constraints.
    - >-
      Cutting capacity: block dimensions, cycle times, knife availability,
      nesting rules.
    - >-
      Due-date optimizer: minimize weighted tardiness while respecting finite
      capacity.
    - 'Campaigning: auto-build runs to reduce steam/cleaning losses and setups.'
    - Live Gantt with drag-and-drop overrides and lock/priority controls.
    - 'Instant re-plan after downtime, rush orders, or material delays.'
    - >-

      API/CSV integration with ERP/MES for orders, routings, molds, and
      inventory.
    - >-
      Role-based access for planners, production, and sales with shareable

  steps:
    - 'Connect orders, routings, molds, silos, and resource calendars (API/CSV).'
    - >-
      Set product rules: aging times, setup matrices, batch sizes, segregation
      rules.
    - Import demand and constraints; define priorities and due dates.
    - Click Generate Schedule; review Gantt and KPI impacts.
    - Adjust with drag-and-drop or locks; approve and publish to the floor.
    - Monitor execution; re-plan in seconds when reality changes.
