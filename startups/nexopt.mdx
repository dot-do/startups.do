  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap rates for flat sheet cutting (laser/plasma/waterjet) are commonly
      10–18% despite advanced nesting tools; remnants are underutilized due to
      poor tracking and scheduling constraints.
    - >-
      Remnant libraries are inaccurate or outdated; operators distrust
      dimensions and avoid using remnants, leading to low reuse (often <20%
      consumed within 90 days).
    - >-
      Job-driven scheduling prevents optimal cross-job batching; due dates and
      setup constraints drive suboptimal nests and excessive sheet pulls.
    - >-
      Existing nesting software optimizes per job/per shift, not across the
      backlog horizon; it rarely proposes re-sequencing orders or dynamic
      batching within delivery windows.
    - >-
      Measuring material yield and proving savings is manual and inconsistent;
      management lacks reliable KPIs to drive continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Mid-market shops lack in-house data science/OR talent to build and
      maintain optimization models integrated with ERP/MES and nesting CAM.
  solution:
    - >-
      Autonomous advisory that ingests jobs, parts, due dates, sheets, and
      remnant catalogs; runs horizon-based optimization to recommend cross-job
      batching within promise windows.
    - >-
      Remnant integrity assurance: computer-vision + geometry checks and
      operator barcode workflows to validate remnant dimensions, kerf
      allowances, grain, heat/lot, and surface direction before use.
    - >-
      Shadow-nesting: simulate alternative nests and schedules; push recommended
      batch groups, sheet/remnant picks, and priorities back into
      SigmaNEST/ProNest/BySoft/Lantek for operator approval.
    - >-
      Inventory and procurement signals: reorder points and sheet size mix
      suggestions based on actual utilization and predicted demand profile by
      thickness/grade.
    - >-
      Savings measurement: automated M&V that compares proposed vs. actual nests
      controlling for mix, thickness, and due dates; produces auditable yield
      and CO2 reduction reports.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: operator acceptance UI on tablet/terminal with quick
      reject reasons (wrong grain, fixture required, quality risk) to improve
      the model.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce material scrap by 2–5 percentage points and double remnant reuse
    rates within 90 days via AI-driven cross-job batching, remnant selection,
    and schedule-aware advisory that plugs into existing nesting
    software—measured, verified, and risk-shared.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset linking recommendations to actual yield, operator
    acceptance, and schedule outcomes across multiple CAM/ERP
    ecosystems—enabling a continuously improving, system-agnostic advisor with
    auditable M&V and optional pay-as-you-save pricing.
