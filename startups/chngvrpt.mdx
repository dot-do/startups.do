leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Planners rely on Excel/ERP heuristics that ignore sequence‑dependent
      setups, cleaning validations, and campaign logic, resulting in frequent
      rescheduling and missed due dates.
    - >-
      High changeover/cleaning time (often 15–35% of reactor time) drives lost
      capacity and overtime; sequence choices are not systematically optimized.
    - >-
      MRP/ERP plans are infinite‑capacity and don’t reflect bottlenecks across
      shared resources (reactors, filters, dryers, tank farm, QC lab), causing
      infeasible schedules.
    - >-
      Rush orders and late material availability trigger manual schedule
      firefighting; decisions depend on tribal knowledge, not repeatable logic.
    - >-
      Long time‑to-deploy for traditional APS (6–12 months) and heavy
      master‑data requirements are barriers; smaller plants can’t justify
      Aspen/Siemens deployments.
    - >-
      Lack of scenario analysis prevents fact‑based tradeoffs between
      changeovers vs. lateness, campaign size vs. inventory, and maintenance/QC
      windows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine that jointly minimizes sequence-dependent
      changeovers/cleanings and order lateness with finite capacity across
      reactors, filters/dryers, tank farm, and QC lab.
    - >-
      Industry templates for changeover matrices (e.g., solvent families, hazard
      classes, contamination risk) and validated cleaning sequences to bootstrap
      from imperfect data.
    - >-
      What-if scenario sandbox: compare campaigns, rush-order insertion,
      alternate routing, and maintenance windows with KPI deltas (changeover
      hours, OTD, overtime, inventory).
    - >-
      Fast deployment via connectors to SAP PP-PI/PP-DS, Oracle EBS, and common
      MES/historians; reads existing routings, calendars, BOMs, and demand—no
      master-data rebuild.
    - >-
      Interactive Gantt with drag-and-drop plus explainable optimization
      (why-this-sequence), soft/hard constraints, and user overrides with
      instant feasibility checks.
    - >-
      Operational guardrails: lot/grade wheels, minimum campaign sizes, tank
      availability, sequence-dependent cleaning times/validations, QC
      sampling/testing queues, and labor shifts.
    - >-
      Automated daily re-plan and exception-based alerts (material delays, QC
      holds, equipment downtime).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-term, feasible production schedules that cut sequence-dependent
    changeovers and lateness without overhauling master data—live in 4–6 weeks,

  character: >-
    Production/operations planner at a basic organic chemicals plant (NAICS
    325199) who must commit dates and increase throughput across shared
    reactors, tanks, and utilities.
  problem: >-
    External: sequence-dependent changeovers, long cleanouts/flushes, tank and
    utility constraints, QC release lags causing lateness and overtime.
    Internal: ERP/MRP plan is not feasible; spreadsheets take hours; constant
    firefighting. Philosophical: planners should not have to choose between
    feasibility and efficiency.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we have lived batch chemical scheduling pain—campaigns, cleaning
    validation, hazardous changeovers. Authority: built by APS veterans and
    chemical ops engineers; pilots show 15-35% less changeover and +5-15 points
    OTIF; integrates with SAP/Oracle/CSV without rip-and-replace.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect existing demand and capacity data (CSV/API). 2) Configure
    changeover matrix, shift and maintenance calendars, resource and tank rules.
    3) Run optimizer daily/weekly; review Gantt and KPIs; accept/override;
    publish schedule back to ERP/MES.

    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo using your sample data. Transitional: Download
    a sample schedule and ROI calculator; start a 2-week pilot.
  success: >-
    Feasible 2-8 week schedules that minimize changeovers and lateness; 15-35%
    fewer cleanouts/flushes; higher OTIF and throughput; clear operator
    sequences; less overtime/expediting; reliable promise dates; faster response
    to rush orders.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means ongoing firefighting, late shipments, excess solvent and
    waste from frequent cleanouts, lost capacity, operator burnout, customer
    penalties, and missed revenue.
