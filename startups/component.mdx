  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic component shortages, EOL/PCN churn, and long lifecycles (7–12
      years) create persistent line-down and redesign risk for analytical
      instrument OEMs
    - >-
      Manual alternate sourcing takes 2–8 hours per part, requires scarce domain
      expertise across electronics, pneumatics, optics, and materials, and is
      error-prone
    - >-
      ECO and RFQ documentation for regulated, audited environments (ISO
      9001/13485, CE, RoHS/REACH) consumes 4–12 hours per change with multiple
      review loops
    - >-
      Fragmented data across PLM, ERP, eCAD/MCAD, distributor portals, and
      compliance systems hinders fast, defensible decisions
    - >-
      Limited visibility into supplier health and counterfeit risk increases
      quality escapes and audit findings
    - >-
      Current tools optimize electronics only; analytical instruments require
      cross-domain compatibility (chemical compatibility, outgassing, thermal
      drift, vibration, EMI, cleanliness) that generic parametric search does
      not capture
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest BOMs directly from PLM/ERP/eCAD and normalize parts with a domain
      ontology spanning electronics, fluidics, optics, and materials
    - >-
      Propose cross-compatible alternates using a hybrid of physics-informed
      parametrics, standards-based constraints, and AI similarity models trained
      on historical ECOs
    - >-
      Score each recommendation on supply risk, lifecycle horizon, counterfeit
      exposure, compliance (RoHS/REACH/PFAS), and performance fit; provide
      explainability and citations
    - >-
      Auto-draft ECOs including affected items, form-fit-function analysis,
      test/validation plan, risk assessment (FMEA-lite), and redlines for PLM
      import
    - >-
      Generate RFQs with consolidated line items, alternates, compliance asks,
      and approved supplier lists; dispatch to distributor and EMS APIs and
      track bids
    - >-
      Continuously monitor watchlists for lead-time spikes, PCNs/EOLs, and
      compliance updates; alert teams in Teams/Slack and recommend pre-approved
      alternates
    - >-
      Provide audit-ready traceability: decision logs, data sources, sign-offs,
      and change history to satisfy ISO and customer audits
    - >-
      Offer VPC/on-prem deployment options with SSO, SCIM, audit logs, and
      granular permissions
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce shortage firefighting by turning weeks of alternate-part discovery
    and documentation into hours, with a domain-trained copilot that finds
    cross-compatible components, quantifies risk, and auto-drafts compliant ECOs
    and RFQs for analytical instruments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific compatibility graph and feedback-trained models built from
    real analytical instrument ECOs and test data, combined with deep
    integrations into PLM/ERP and supplier networks, enabling explainable,
    audit-ready alternates across electronics, fluidics, and optics that
    general-purpose sourcing tools cannot reliably deliver.

  character: >-
    Ops, sourcing, and sustaining engineering leaders at analytical laboratory
    instrument manufacturers who must keep complex, regulated products buildable
    and compliant.
  problem: >-
    External: Shortages, EOL/PCNs, long lead times, single-source AVLs, and
    RoHS/REACH/safety constraints.

    Internal: BOM churn and manual cross-refs overwhelm teams; risk of schedule
    slips and margin erosion.

    Philosophical: One missing part shouldn’t stop science or shipments.
  guide: >-
    We understand line-down risk and validation burden in instrument
    manufacturing. Our AI copilot finds cross-compatible parts, scores risk
    (availability, lifecycle, form/fit/function, compliance, supplier), and
    drafts ECOs and RFQs with supporting evidence. Human-in-the-loop,
    audit-ready, and integrated with PLM/ERP/QMS.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your BOM/AVL (CSV or API).

    2) Review alternates with risk scores, datasheets, and FFF/compliance
    evidence.

    3) Approve to auto-draft ECOs/RFQs and sync to your systems.

    Pilot on one product; you retain approval control; exportable artifacts.

    Transitional: Download a sample risk report and security/data-handling
    brief.
  success: >-
    On-time builds; resilient multi-source AVL; faster ECO turnaround; lower
    expedite risk and COGS; compliance documented; confident teams and satisfied
    customers.
