leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High false-positive rate and inconsistent human interpretation in PT/UT/ET
      lead to excessive review time and rework.
    - >-
      Level II/III technician shortages and overtime cause throughput
      bottlenecks and rising inspection cost-per-part.
    - >-
      Current review tools are vendor-specific (UT/ET instruments) and not
      optimized for triage/prioritization across modalities; C-scans, impedance
      plots, and PT images are time-consuming to screen.
    - >-
      Defects can be discovered late (post-processing), increasing scrap and
      rework costs; prioritization of likely-critical indications is ad hoc.
    - >-
      Compliance demands (NADCAP/AS9100/ASTM) require full traceability and
      documented decision rationale, which is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Plants operate in air-gapped or restricted environments; most AI offerings
      aren’t deployable on-prem with required cybersecurity and validation
      evidence.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision and signal-processing models pre-classify indications from
      UT (A/B/C/SAFT/PAUT), PT (visible/fluorescent images/video), and ET
      (impedance-plane/time series) into severity/likelihood bands.
    - >-
      Queue and prioritization engine ranks indications for human review with
      configurable rules (e.g., alloy, geometry, customer spec, historical
      risk).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workstation that overlays bounding
      boxes/heatmaps, suggested call (reject/rework/monitor), and confidence
      with quick-accept/quick-escalate.
    - >-
      Automated documentation: store decisions, screenshots, and model
      inferences to create audit-ready records (traceability to part, operator,
      instrument settings, calibration).
    - >-
      Seamless ingestion from common NDT systems via SDKs/file drops; supports
      vendor formats and open standards where available (e.g., DICONDE for
      applicable modalities) and produces structured outputs to QMS/MES.
    - >-
      On-prem edge inference server supporting air-gapped plants (Windows/Linux
      GPU), with optional private cloud for multi-site model management.
    - >-
      Validation pack: statistically powered performance studies and MSA/Gage
      R&R to support internal approval and customer qualification.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce NDT review time by 40–60% while maintaining or improving detection
    performance. Vendor-agnostic AI triage prioritizes critical UT/PT/ET
    indications for faster human disposition, with full auditability and
    on-prem/air-gapped deployment aligned to NADCAP/AS9100 requirements. Typical
    payback < 6 months on a single high-throughput line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, alloy- and geometry-specific dataset and model library for
    nonferrous forgings across UT/PT/ET, combined with pre-built OEM connectors
    and audit-ready validation packs for NADCAP/AS9100 environments. Ability to
    deploy air-gapped with vendor-agnostic triage that preserves existing
    instruments and procedures, reducing change friction.

  character: >-
    NDT leaders in nonferrous forging (Level II/III, Quality/Manufacturing
    Engineering) who must clear UT/PT/ET backlogs fast without missing critical
    indications or failing audits.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual triage is slow, inconsistent, and buried in UT/PT/ET
    images and scan data.

    - Internal: Teams are stretched; overtime and fatigue increase risk.

    - Philosophical: Safety‑critical forgings deserve objective, timely NDT
    decisions.
  guide: >-
    An NDT‑aware AI partner. We blend computer vision and signal analysis with
    forging‑domain expertise. We understand NADCAP/AS9100, work across UT/PT/ET,
    and deliver secure, audit‑ready workflows with human oversight.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Stream or upload UT/PT/ET results; map to parts and specs.

    2) Calibrate: Train to your indications and acceptance criteria; validate on
    historical lots and set thresholds.

    3) Deploy: Triage dashboard/API that pre‑classifies and prioritizes
    indications with confidence and rationale for human review.

    4) Improve: Monitor drift, tune models, and export traceable records for
    audits.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and start a two‑week pilot on your data. Or download
    the validation and compliance brief.
  success: >-
    Inspectors focus on true risk; review time drops; backlogs shrink; fewer
    false calls; earlier feedback to forging; higher on‑time delivery; reduced
    cost per part; consistent, auditable NDT decisions.
  failure: >-
    Backlogs grow; inspectors burn out; critical indications are missed or
    over‑called; late shipments; audit findings; scrap and rework; lost trust
    and contracts.
