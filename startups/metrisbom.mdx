  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs in NAICS 334514 lack complete, machine-readable SBOMs
      (SPDX/CycloneDX) for legacy and current meter/counter firmware, causing
      RFP losses and compliance gaps.
    - >-
      PSIRT and firmware teams spend 6–10 hours per release manually triaging
      CVEs/CWEs with high false positive rates (often >25%), delaying releases
      and hotfixes.
    - >-
      Embedded stacks (ARM/MIPS/PowerPC/ARM-M) and RTOS/bare-metal builds
      obscure third-party components, making binary-only attribution and license
      compliance hard.
    - >-
      Utilities and industrial buyers increasingly require SBOM + VEX and
      vulnerability handling evidence (IEC 62443, US EO 14028-aligned
      procurement, EU CRA), but most OEMs lack repeatable processes.
    - >-
      General-purpose SCA tools miss ICS/embedded context (e.g., ICS-CERT KEV,
      EPSS, safety impact, firmware signing/OTA risks), leading to poor
      prioritization and wasted engineering cycles.
    - >-
      Unclear exploitability in-field (vs. lab) leads to over-remediation; OEMs
      cannot confidently communicate VEX to customers, inflating support burden.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchains (Yocto, Zephyr, FreeRTOS, QNX, bare-metal) prevent
      standardized SBOM generation across product lines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated SBOM generation for embedded firmware (SPDX 2.3, CycloneDX 1.6)
      from source, build artifacts, and binaries (ARM/Thumb, MIPS, PowerPC;
      ELF/HEX/DFU).
    - >-
      AI-assisted CVE/CWE enrichment using EPSS, KEV, ICS-CERT advisories, and
      component version intelligence to rank remediation by safety/operational
      impact.
    - >-
      Automated VEX creation indicating exploitability-in-context (reachable,
      mitigated, not present) to reduce downstream noise for customers and
      auditors.
    - >-
      IEC 62443-4-1/4-2 and SSDF-aligned evidence packs: traceability,
      vulnerability handling records, and release notes automation for audits
      and RFPs.
    - >-
      CI/CD and OTA pipeline integrations (Yocto layers, GitLab/GitHub/Azure
      DevOps plugins) with policy gates for PSIRT sign-off.
    - >-
      Binary diffing and hotfix guidance across firmware branches to minimize
      patch scope while preserving metrology accuracy and certification
      constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    End-to-end SBOM and vulnerability triage tailored to meter and counting
    device firmware: generate accurate SBOMs from source or binaries,
    auto-create VEX with ICS-aware exploitability and remediation priorities,
    and deliver compliance evidence mapped to IEC 62443 and EU CRA—cutting
    triage time by 60–80% and reducing false positives below 5%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Embedded-first binary attribution and ICS-aware exploitability modeling
    trained on a large corpus of meter/counter firmware, combined with prebuilt
    IEC 62443/CRA evidence automation and deep partnerships with silicon/RTOS
    ecosystems—enabling faster, more accurate SBOM/VEX and triage than
    general-purpose SCA tools.

    External: opaque third-party components in meter firmware, nonstop CVE/CWE
    flow, and rising SBOM demands from customers and regulators. Internal:
    overwhelmed triage and scarce security staff risking release delays.
    Philosophical: critical infrastructure devices should not ship with unknown
    risk.
  guide: >-
    We understand embedded constraints, utility/industrial requirements, and
    audit pressure in NAICS 334514. Our AI service generates precise SBOMs
    (SPDX/CycloneDX), maps CVEs/CWEs to your binaries and RTOS stacks,
    de-duplicates noise, and ranks fixes by exploitability and safety impact
    (VEX-ready), with on-prem/offline options.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect CI or upload firmware/build artifacts. 2) Auto-generate SBOM and
    scan; receive prioritized remediation with rationale. 3) Export
    reports/tickets and track risk across SKUs for audits and customer
    deliverables. No source code required; data stays under your control.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 20-minute demo. Transitional: Upload a sample firmware
    for a free SBOM and risk summary.
  success: >-
    Ship secure firmware on schedule; deliver audit-ready SBOMs to win bids; cut
    triage time and false positives; align with NTIA SBOM elements, NIST SSDF,
    and IEC 62443; reduce advisories and strengthen trust with utilities and OEM
    partners.
  failure: >-
    Missed bids due to absent SBOMs, late releases, emergency patching, field
    exposure in deployed meters, audit findings, brand damage, and costly
    recalls.
