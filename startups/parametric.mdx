  problem:
    - >-
      Industrial design teams inherit ‘dumb’ solids (STEP/IGES/mesh) or concept
      surfaces that require 8–20 hours of manual re-build to become editable,
      parametric CAD.
    - >-
      Design intent (constraints, naming, feature hierarchy) is rarely captured,
      leading to brittle models and costly rework during late-stage changes.
    - >-
      Handoffs between ID → ME → manufacturing lack DFM assumptions (draft
      angles, wall thickness, bend radii, tool access), causing iteration loops
      and delays.
    - >-
      Version/variant management is painful: teams duplicate files for small
      changes instead of using robust configurations/parameters.
    - >-
      Cross-CAD collaboration (SolidWorks, Creo, Onshape, Fusion 360) is slow
      due to poor interoperability and inconsistent feature sets.
    - >-
      Agencies face margin compression—billable time is spent on repetitive
      remodeling rather than higher-value design work.
    - >-
      IP/security concerns limit the use of offshore re-modeling services and
      general-purpose freelancers.
    - >-
      Tight timelines (e.g., design sprints, funding milestones, tradeshow
      deadlines) demand fast parametric turnarounds (<24–72 hours), which
      current processes cannot reliably meet.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven conversion of sketches/briefs/STEP/IGES/mesh into clean,
      editable parametric feature trees with constraints, naming conventions,
      and organized sub-features.
    - >-
      Automatic injection of manufacturing assumptions by process (injection
      molding, CNC, sheet metal, die casting, additive) including drafts, wall
      thickness, bend radii, tooling fillets, hole standards, and tolerance
      presets.
    - >-
      Configuration/parameter generation for common variants (size, wall
      thickness, materials, hole patterns) with parameter documentation and
      locked design rules.
    - >-
      Cross-CAD exports with feature mapping to major MCAD systems; validation
      suite to confirm feature/constraint fidelity post-export.
    - >-
      DFM checks and remediation suggestions inline (draft violations,
      undercuts, min radius, unsupported overhangs, bend feasibility, tool
      accessibility).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review portal enabling quick edits, approvals, and audit
      trails; SLA-backed delivery options (same-day/next-day).
    - >-
      Secure environment with IP protections (SOC 2 roadmap, encryption at
      rest/in transit, customer-managed keys for enterprise).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From design intent to editable CAD in hours, not days. AI builds DFM-ready,
    named, and constrained parametric models with configurable
    variants—exportable to your CAD of choice (SolidWorks, Creo, Onshape, Fusion
    360).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continually growing, proprietary dataset linking real-world industrial
    designs to clean parametric feature trees and process-specific DFM
    assumptions—combined with hybrid AI + deterministic rule engines and deep
    integrations across major CAD platforms. This yields higher acceptance
    rates, faster turnarounds, and cross-CAD fidelity that point tools and
    manual services struggle to match.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Boutique and mid-size industrial design studios (5–50 designers) producing
      consumer electronics, furniture, wearables, appliances, packaging.
    - >-
      In-house ID/ME teams at hardware startups (Seed–Series C) needing rapid
      iteration and variant exploration.
    - >-
      Contract manufacturers and DFM engineering teams needing parametric
      foundations for quoting and tooling.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Industrial designers and product development teams who need editable,
    design-intent-driven CAD they can trust from concept to manufacture.
  problem: >-
    CAD often arrives as brittle geometry: edits break features, variants
    require rework, and manufacturability assumptions are hidden—causing delays,
    risk, and cost.
  guide: >-
    Parametric CAD Starter pairs industrial design expertise with AI-driven
    modeling. We understand schedule pressure and build clean, named feature
    trees that encode design intent, configurations, and manufacturing method
    assumptions.
  plan: >-
    1) Share requirements, references, and manufacturing targets. 2) We generate
    the parametric CAD foundation with parameters, configurations, and method
    assumptions. 3) Review, iterate, and hand off source files plus
    documentation.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-min scoping call to start your pilot. Transitional:
    Download a sample model and the Design-Intent Checklist.
  success: >-
    A resilient, editable CAD base that speeds iterations, supports configurable
    variants, aligns teams, and de-risks handoff to engineering and
    manufacturing.
  failure: >-
    Keep fighting fragile models, missed timelines, costly tooling changes, and
    CAD that locks you into yesterday’s decisions.

      Turn design intent into clean, editable parametric CAD—manufacturing-ready
      from day one.
    ctaText: Start from your brief
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - Concepts get stuck as static meshes or messy feature trees.
    - No parameters or configs means slow handoff to engineering.

      intent.
    - Configurations and named features out of the box for fast iteration.
    - >-
