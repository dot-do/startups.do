leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Late detection of drift/tool wear in machining (tie-rod ends, ball-joint
      housings, knuckles, stabilizer links) drives scrap/rework; typical scrap
      1–3% of throughput and 8–20 hours/month of rework on problem lines.
    - >-
      Manual SPC reviews and end-of-shift checks miss early signals; operators
      are overloaded and Western Electric/AIAG rules alone generate false
      alarms, leading to alarm fatigue.
    - >-
      Unplanned tool changes and offset corrections cause downtime and
      dimensional instability; tool life varies by material lot, coolant
      condition, and machine, making fixed-count replacement inefficient.
    - >-
      PPAP/IATF 16949 requires statistical evidence of control; proving
      sustained control and traceability across multi-cavity/multi-spindle
      operations is time-consuming and error-prone.
    - >-
      Existing IIoT/tool condition systems often require new sensors and complex
      integration; most plants already collect SPC but don’t exploit it for
      predictive insights.
    - >-
      Quality and process engineers spend 6–15 hours/week per line on SPC
      triage, data cleanup, and root-cause hunts instead of prevention.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest real-time SPC streams (X̄-R, I-MR, histograms) and machine signals
      via OPC UA/MTConnect; normalize by part, operation, cavity/spindle, and
      gage.
    - >-
      Apply online change-point detection (CUSUM/EWMA/BOCPD) plus multivariate
      feature modeling to identify drift, trend, and abnormal variance in
      <1-minute latency.
    - >-
      Estimate remaining tool life and time-to-OOS per feature/tool using
      Bayesian survival models calibrated by material lot, coolant, and
      speed/feed context.
    - >-
      Generate actionable advisories: offset suggestions, tool change windows,
      and probable root causes (tool, fixture, gage, coolant, program) with
      confidence scores.
    - >-
      Deliver alerts into operator HMIs, Andon, Teams/Email/SMS with escalation
      policies; capture technician e-sign-offs to create traceable corrective
      actions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop API for CNC/PLC to stage offset recommendations for human
      approval; guardrails enforce IATF-compliant change control.
    - >-
      Dashboards: live capability (Cpk/Ppk), early warning lead time, scrap
      avoidance, and PPAP-ready evidence packs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap and rework 25–50% and catch dimensional drift 2–8 hours before
    out-of-spec using the SPC data you already collect—no new sensors.
    Purpose-built models for steering/suspension machining predict tool wear and
    recommend offsets with low false alarms, accelerating PPAP compliance and
    stabilizing Cpk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned SPC-to-prediction engine for 336330 with pre-trained
    templates for common features and tools, enabling cold-start in <2 weeks
    using existing SPC only—no sensors—and a governed offset recommendation
    workflow aligned to IATF/PPAP practices. Accumulating proprietary
    per-tool/per-feature life priors across plants compounds accuracy over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and operations leaders at steering and suspension machining plants
    (tie-rod ends, ball-joint housings, knuckles) who must ship zero-defect
    parts, hold Cp/Cpk, and keep lines running without watching thousands of SPC
    charts.
  problem: >-
    External: SPC drift and tool wear emerge between checks, causing out-of-spec
    parts, scrap, sorting, chargebacks, and line stops. Internal: teams drown in
    data, false alarms, and constant firefighting. Philosophical: plant data
    should prevent defects before customers find them.
  guide: >-
    We are manufacturing data scientists and ex-automotive process engineers. We
    understand IATF/PPAP constraints and integrate with your existing SPC and
    machine data, so you gain early warning without ripping and replacing.
  plan: >-
    Connect machining SPC streams and machine signals. Calibrate AI on your
    parts, tools, and control plans. Receive clear early-wear and drift alerts
    with recommended actions, prove value on one cell, then scale.
  callToAction: Start a 30-day pilot on one machining cell.
  success: >-
    Predict wear and drift before specs are breached, stabilize processes, cut
    scrap and sorting, extend tool life, protect customer scorecards and
    launches, and give teams calm, data-driven control.
  failure: >-
    Without early warning, subtle shifts turn into escapes, premium freight,
    audit findings, weekend rework, and lost customer confidence.

    title: SPC Drift & Tool Wear Early Warning for Steering & Suspension Machining
    subtitle: >-
      AI monitors SPC streams on tie rod ends, ball‑joint housings, control arm
      bores, and more—catching shifts and wear before parts go out of spec.
    ctaText: Start a pilot
    ctaHref: /contact?demo=spc-early-warning
  problem:
    - SPC reviews are reactive—trends are found after scrap builds.
    - Classic control limits miss slow drift and compound wear patterns.
    - >-
      Tool alarms fire too late or too often, causing downtime or
      over-adjustment.
    - 'Mixed-model lines mask issues across parts, machines, and tool pockets.'
    - >-
      SPC data sits in silos (gauges, CMM, SPC apps), blocking real-time
      response.
    - >-
      Tight tolerances on bores, tapers, and spherical seats leave no buffer for
      missed trends.
    - 'Quality risk grows: rework, escapes, and PPAP delays.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous AI on X̄–R, I–MR, and capability metrics detects drift and
      probable tool wear early.
    - >-
      Predicts remaining tool life with time-to-limit estimates and confidence

    - Review weekly to refine thresholds and lock in scrap and downtime savings.
