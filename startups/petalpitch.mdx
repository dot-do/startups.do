  problem:
    - >-
      Florists spend 2–6 hours per full wedding or corporate proposal (mood
      board, recipes, stem counts, pricing, timeline, contract). In peak season
      this bottleneck causes slow replies and lost bookings.
    - >-
      60%+ of inbound inquiries are unqualified or stall; delayed responses
      (over 24–48 hours) can reduce win rate by 20–30%.
    - >-
      Manual recipe/stem counts and ad-hoc pricing create 5–12% margin leakage
      due to over/under-ordering, missed labor, or waste factors.
    - >-
      Work is fragmented across Canva, Google Docs/Sheets, email, e-sign,
      payment links, and calendar—error-prone and hard to track.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either generic (no floral intelligence) or
      complex/expensive, with little automation from inquiry to proposal.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse inquiries from email/forms/DM into client brief, budget, quantities,
      and aesthetic keywords.
    - >-
      Auto-generate mood board with rights-safe images matched to style/season,
      plus optional upsell tiers.
    - >-
      Create floral recipes per item with stem counts, substitution logic,
      seasonal availability, and live/local price references when available.
    - >-
      Price engine applies markups, labor, waste, delivery, taxes, and venue
      fees; suggests upsells and good/better/best packages.
    - >-
      Generate event timeline, staffing plan, and load-in/load-out schedule from
      venue constraints and scope.
    - >-
      Assemble branded proposal with contract clauses; collect e-signature and
      deposit via Stripe; sync to accounting/CRM.
    - >-
      Versioning, comments, change orders, and automatic update of recipes and
      pricing across versions.
    - >-
      Analytics: proposal open/accept times, win rate, margin variance, time
      saved; SKU-level insights.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From inquiry to a branded, cost-accurate, e-signable floral proposal in
    under 10 minutes. Increase win rates by 15–25% through faster, more polished
    responses; protect margins with AI-optimized recipes and stem counts; reduce
    proposal time by 70–90% (2–4 hours saved per event).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving dataset tying inquiry language and inspiration
    images to winning proposals, recipes, stem counts, and actual costs by
    region/season—enabling accurate, localized, and conversion-optimized
    proposals that generic tools and manual workflows cannot match.

  character: >-
    Professional florist studios (weddings, funerals, corporate) who want to
    turn inquiries into booked, profitable jobs without admin drag.
  problem: >-
    - External: Inquiries are scattered; proposals take hours; pricing and stem
    counts are manual and error-prone; brand and timelines are inconsistent;
    contracts are cobbled together.

    - Internal: Overwhelmed, worried about missed details, and frustrated by
    slow or messy proposals that risk the sale.

    - Philosophical: Talented florists should design, not wrestle with
    documents—and clients deserve clear, timely, beautiful proposals.
  guide: >-

    ordering, and design days, and how hard it is to keep proposals fast and
    consistent.

    proposals with mood boards, recipes, stem counts, pricing, timelines, and
    contracts—fully customizable with human-in-the-loop approval.

      4) Send the branded proposal and contract for approval/signature.

  success: |-
    - Send polished proposals in minutes, not hours.
    - Win more jobs at healthy margins with accurate stem counts and pricing.
    - Present a consistent, premium brand across all event types.
