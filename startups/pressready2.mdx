  problem:
    - >-
      Incoming artwork from customers and brokers arrives with issues (missing
      fonts, low-res images, incorrect color spaces, spot-color mishandling,
      dieline on printable layer, insufficient bleed/trap), consuming 30–90
      minutes of prepress time per job.
    - >-
      Step-and-repeat imposition for die-cut and sheet/roll formats is
      error-prone and often requires tribal knowledge of press, die, and
      substrate constraints, leading to waste and press downtime.
    - >-
      Proof cycles are slow (1–2 days) due to manual preflight reports, markups,
      and re-exports, delaying approvals and press schedules.
    - >-
      Reprints and NCRs from preventable errors (barcode failures, wrong
      overprint/knockout, wrong grain direction, text below min size) erode
      margins; many plants run >1% remake rates.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either general-purpose or require heavy scripting;
      smaller converters lack Esko/Prinergy automation budget or talent to
      maintain it.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (MIS specs, die libraries, press constraints) isn’t
      connected to artwork checks, so preflight doesn’t enforce true production
      rules (e.g., anilox/ink limits, TAC, tolerances), causing downstream
      problems.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven preflight engine tailored to converted-paper work: detects and
      auto-corrects common packaging/converting issues (color, fonts, bleed,
      traps, dielines, barcodes, overprint, min type).
    - >-
      Die-aware imposition: takes press sheet/roll specs, grain, die library
      (CF2/DXF), gutters, and step-off; outputs optimized step-and-repeat with
      marks, color bars, and register targets.
    - >-
      Automated proofing: generates soft proofs with annotation and rule
      explanations; one-click customer portal for approve/changes; version
      control and audit trail.
    - >-
      Constraints solver: optimizes layout for waste reduction, makeready
      minimization, and press changeover time; honors coating windows, nicks,
      slugs, and matrix removal rules.
    - >-
      Integrations: Hot folders/API; connectors for MIS/ERP (EFI, Aptean, Oracle
      NetSuite), Esko/Hybrid/Prinergy/Switch, RIPs (Fiery/Creo/Heidelberg), and
      die-makers’ libraries.
    - >-
      Compliance/color: ICC-based color management, spot-to-process mapping by
      press/ink set, TAC/ink coverage checks, barcode generation/verification
      (EAN/UPC/DataMatrix/QR), and ISO reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut prepress time by 60–80% and reduce reprints by 30–50% by automatically
    preflighting, fixing, and creating die-aware, press-ready step-and-repeat
    impositions with instant proofs—integrated with your MIS, die libraries, and
    press constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Die-aware AI with proprietary correction datasets and closed-loop learning
    from production outcomes (JMF/press data) that continuously improves rules
    by press, substrate, and die—plus turnkey on-prem deployment for secure
    plants and native connectors to die libraries that incumbents lack
    out-of-the-box.
