  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven nexus screening is error-prone and slow;
      preparers must track 50-state income/franchise rules, economic nexus
      thresholds, throwback/throwout, and P.L. 86-272 nuances that change
      frequently.
    - >-
      Disparate data sources (GL/ERP, payroll, e‑commerce, property ledgers)
      make it hard to assemble accurate sales/payroll/property by state; mapping
      and deduplication consume hours per engagement.
    - >-
      Firms face rising risk from remote employees and e‑commerce creating
      unexpected nexus/apportionment exposure; missing a filing can trigger
      penalties, interest, and costly voluntary disclosure programs.
    - >-
      Staffing shortages and compressed filing seasons require automation;
      managers need audit-ready workpapers and defensible citations without
      adding headcount.
    - >-
      Existing tools focus on sales tax or large-enterprise indirect tax;
      mid-market tax prep firms lack an affordable, integrated income/franchise
      nexus and apportionment solution.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion hub: connect QuickBooks Online, Xero, NetSuite,
      Shopify/Amazon, ADP/Paychex/Gusto, and upload CSVs; auto-map to state by
      ship-to/ship-from, employee work location, and property address.
    - >-
      50-state rules engine: income/franchise tax nexus thresholds (economic and
      physical), apportionment methods (single sales vs weighted 3-factor),
      market-based vs cost-of-performance sourcing, throwback/throwout, P.L.
      86-272 screening questionnaire with web-activity flags.
    - >-
      AI-assisted classification: geocoding/zip-to-state mapping,
      de-duplication, and anomaly detection to identify likely misclassified
      receipts or payroll; surface confidence scores and exceptions.
    - >-
      Apportionment calculator: compute sales/payroll/property factors by state;
      support special industries (service receipts, SaaS, TPP, construction)
      with adjustable sourcing rules and overrides; maintain period-by-period
      history.
    - >-
      Audit-ready documentation: generate workpapers with factor calculations,
      nexus determinations, assumptions, and citations (state
      statutes/regulations/bulletins) with effective dates; export to PDF/Excel
      and attach to returns.
    - >-
      Workflow & collaboration: entity roll-forward, preparer/reviewer
      checklists, change logs, and e-sign for client questionnaires; API/CSV
      export to CCH Axcess, UltraTax, ProConnect Lacerte, and GoSystem (via
      bridges).
    - >-
      Change monitoring: weekly rules updates with release notes; alert clients
      when activity changes trigger new filing obligations mid-year.
    - >-
      Registration & filing guidance: recommend registration sequence and
      earliest filing periods; optional integration to registration partners or
      handoff packages.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, audit-ready multi-state nexus screening and apportionment
    workpapers for every business client—statute-cited, always up to date, and
    integrated with your tax stack—cutting prep time by 50–70% while reducing
    missed filings and penalties.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, citation-backed SALT rules corpus tuned for
    preparers (not just enterprises), paired with audit-ready workpapers that
    mirror state PBC expectations, plus deep SMB-focused integrations. Feedback
    loops from thousands of screened entities improve classification and
    exception handling, creating data network effects and higher accuracy over
    time. Early SOC 2 certification and CPE co-branding with CPA societies raise
    trust and switching costs.
