leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Highly seasonal and weather-driven demand causes frequent stockouts during
      heat spikes and overproduction during cool spells, leading to melt loss
      and wasted energy.
    - >-
      Most ice manufacturers plan production with spreadsheets and tribal
      knowledge, making it difficult to coordinate bagger lines, freezer
      capacity, labor rosters, and delivery schedules across SKUs and plants.
    - >-
      SKU/outlet-level forecasting is hard because orders are lumpy, retailers
      change planograms, and local events can swing demand by 2–5x within 24–48
      hours.
    - >-
      Poor visibility into near-term demand and capacity leads to overtime,
      emergency runs, and missed deliveries that damage retailer relationships
      and incur penalties.
    - >-
      Energy and labor costs rise during reactive planning; plants can’t easily
      pre-freeze inventory ahead of heat waves while respecting storage
      constraints and shrink risk.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (ERP, route tickets, POS, telematics, weather) and not
      modeled together to produce actionable, constraint-aware daily/shift
      plans.
  solution:
    - >-
      High-frequency demand forecasts at SKU x outlet x day horizon (1–21 days)
      using ensemble models with weather, events, and route signals.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware production planning optimizer that allocates volume to
      lines/shifts, sequences SKUs, and proposes pre-freeze strategy within
      freezer limits.
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from ERP/orders, route tickets, POS feeds,
      weather APIs, telematics, and event calendars; data quality checks and
      anomaly alerts.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning for heat waves, promotions, outages, and line
      downtime; compare service levels, costs, and labor impact.
    - >-
      Live dashboards for plant managers: forecast heat maps, stockout risk by
      outlet, freezer utilization, shift plans, and pick/load suggestions.
    - >-
      APIs and flat-file connectors to push plans to ERP/route-planning systems;
      audit trails and explainable drivers of forecast changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI forecasts SKU/outlet demand and auto-builds daily/shift production plans
    that respect bagger capacity, labor, and freezer constraints—cutting
    stockouts and melt waste while lowering overtime within 4–6 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ice manufacturers (bags and blocks) who need precise daily SKU-level
    production plans to meet demand without waste.
  problem: >-
    Weather-driven demand swings cause stockouts, overtime, and melt-induced
    loss because planners lack accurate forecasts and capacity-aware schedules.
  guide: >-
    We understand summer spikes and freezer limits. Our AI blends sales and
    weather with factory constraints to deliver reliable, actionable plans—built
    by experts in CPG cold-chain and production planning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sales, weather, and production data. 2) Calibrate SKU-level
    forecasts. 3) Auto-generate daily/shift plans that respect line capacity,
    labor, changeovers, and storage, with alerts and easy overrides.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute assessment or start a 4-week pilot.
  success: >-
    Make the right ice in the right quantities, hit service levels, reduce
    overtime and waste, stabilize shifts, and protect margins—even on heat
    spikes.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing—overproduce on cool days, short hot days, pay rush costs, lose
    retailer confidence, and erode profit.

  problem:
    - 'Weather swings make demand unpredictable by day, route, and SKU.'
    - 'Spreadsheets miss delivery windows, seasonality, and line constraints.'
    - >-
      Overproduction melts; underproduction loses sales and triggers
      chargebacks.
    - Freezer space is tight; the wrong mix clogs storage.
    - Bagging and block lines have different rates and changeovers.
    - Staffing and overtime rarely match true demand.
    - Late re-forecasting forces emergency runs and reschedules.
    - 'Data is scattered across POS, ERP, and dispatch systems.'
  solution:
    - 'Daily forecasts by plant/route/SKU using weather, holidays, and events.'
    - >-
      Shift-by-shift plans optimized for line rates, changeovers, labor, and
      freezer limits.
