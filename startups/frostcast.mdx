  title: Weather- and Event-Aware Demand Forecasting (SKU x Channel)
  description: >-

  problem:
    - >-
      Demand is highly weather- and holiday-sensitive; legacy forecasting misses
      10–30% of heat-driven demand surges, driving stockouts and retailer
      penalties.
    - >-
      Promotions and limited-time offers create cannibalization and halo effects
      across SKUs and channels that current tools don’t quantify at the weekly
      cadence planners need.
    - >-
      Forecasts are typically at aggregate brand or customer level; planners
      need accurate, explainable weekly forecasts at SKU x customer/channel
      granularity to plan production lines and cold-chain capacity.
    - >-
      High shrink and write-offs (5–15%) from overproduction after cold spells
      or missed promotional alignment erode margins.
    - >-
      Manual data wrangling across POS portals, shipments, weather feeds, and
      promotion calendars consumes planner time (>6–10 hours/week per planner)
      and delays decisions.
    - >-
      Existing enterprise tools are slow to implement (6–12 months), lack
      domain-specific weather/event features for frozen desserts, or are too
      expensive for mid-market brands.
    - >-
      Inconsistent service levels (fill rate <95%) and biased forecasts cause
      lost sales during weekends/heatwaves and excess inventory in shoulder
      seasons.
    - >-
      New product introductions and seasonal novelties lack historicals; teams
      need analog-based, transfer learning approaches that current systems lack.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from POS portals, EDI shipments, ERP, and
      trade/promo calendars; enrich with high-resolution weather and
      holiday/event features at store/region level.
    - >-
      Hierarchical probabilistic forecasting at SKU x channel x week with
      weather- and event-lift modeling, cannibalization handling, and
      cold-chain-aware seasonality.
    - >-
      Scenario planning for promos, price, and weather (e.g., +10°F heatwave)
      with lift/sensitivity curves and confidence intervals.
    - >-
      New item forecasting via analogs, attribute similarity, and transfer
      learning from category peers; dynamic lifecycle and phase-in/phase-out
      modeling.
    - >-
      Explainability: per-forecast driver attributions (e.g., temperature,
      holiday, promo) and bias monitoring at each hierarchy level.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to ERP/APS/TMS (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, Blue Yonder,
      o9, Kinaxis) to feed MPS/MRP, deployment, and replenishment plans;
      alerting for exceptions.
    - >-
      Continuous MLOps: automated retraining, backtesting, and Forecast Value
      Add (FVA) tracking vs. naive and legacy benchmarks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weekly, explainable SKU x channel demand forecasts that fuse POS/shipments
    with weather, holidays, and promotions to cut stockouts by 20–40%, reduce
    waste by 10–25%, and improve forecast accuracy by 8–20 points vs. baseline
    within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary frozen-dessert feature engineering and lift curves tuned to
    microclimates and seasonality, combined with a library of promo and
    cannibalization effects specific to novelty formats and pack sizes; prebuilt
    connectors to major ERPs/APS and retailer portals for 6–8 week deployments;
    explainability tailored to S&OP. Model weights for weather/promo sensitivity
    are learned across customers with privacy-preserving techniques,
    accelerating accuracy for new logos while protecting data.
