  problem:
    - >-
      Airlines detect competitor fare and availability moves too slowly (often
      6–24 hours), causing measurable revenue leakage of 0.3–1.0% of passenger
      revenue per affected market-day.
    - >-
      Manual fare monitoring is labor-intensive (analysts spend 25–40% of time
      collecting/cleaning data), delaying response and limiting market coverage.
    - >-
      Existing tools show historic fares but do not explain why anomalies occur
      or prescribe optimal fare, availability, or ancillary actions.
    - >-
      Over- and under-reactions to competitor moves trigger fare wars or missed
      demand; lack of guardrails increases volatility in yield and load factor.
    - >-
      Ancillary pricing often lags base fare changes, leaving incremental
      revenue on the table (bags, seats, priority boarding).
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ATPCO, GDS shop data, OTA/metasearch, schedules, demand
      signals) makes it hard to form a unified, timely view.
    - >-
      Inadequate alert precision (false positives) leads to alert fatigue and
      low analyst trust and adoption.
    - >-
      Change execution is slow; pushing changes through ATPCO/GDS/NDC can take
      hours without automation and QA checks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously monitor competitor fares, availability, and ancillaries by
      market/date; detect, explain, and prioritize anomalies with quantified
      revenue impact.
    - >-
      Generate prescriptive, constrained recommendations for fare, inventory,
      and ancillary adjustments aligned to demand elasticity and business rules.
    - >-
      Enable one-click or automated publishing to ATPCO, NDC, and GDS with audit
      trails, A/B testing, and guardrails to prevent fare wars.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time competitor fare and yield intelligence with a prescriptive RM
    copilot that recommends and executes safe, revenue-positive fare,
    availability, and ancillary actions—lifting 0.5–2.0% passenger revenue on
    covered markets while cutting analyst monitoring time by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary competitive-intelligence graph unifying fares, availability,
    schedules, and demand with airline-specific guardrails; privacy-preserving
    cross-carrier learning that boosts model accuracy without sharing sensitive
    data; and deep integrations that enable safe one-click publishing—turning
    insights into revenue faster than monitoring-only tools.

    Airline revenue management and pricing teams (NAICS 481111) who need faster,
    smarter competitive response.
  problem: >-
    External: Competitor fares and availability shift hourly by market/date;
    manual scans miss swings. Internal: Teams are reactive and
    bandwidth‑constrained. Philosophical: Pricing should reflect demand and
    strategy, not guesswork or spreadsheet firefighting.
  guide: >-
    Competitor Fare Watch & RM Copilot—built by airline RM and data science
    experts—monitors competitor fares/yields 24/7, flags anomalies, and
    recommends fare, RBD availability, and ancillary moves aligned to demand.
    Integrates with ATPCO, GDS/NDC, PSS, and web fares with transparent
    rationale and audit trail.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data sources and define markets/watchlists. 2) Set guardrails
    (brand hierarchy, fences, caps, approval flows) and KPIs. 3) Launch alerts
    and human‑in‑the‑loop recommendations; progress to controlled automation and
    A/B tests.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot in priority
    markets. Transitional: Get a free competitive insights report for your top
    20 O&Ds.
  success: >-
    Proactive detection of competitive moves; faster time‑to‑react; smarter
    fare/availability and ancillary settings; improved load factor, yield, and
    RASM; reduced spoilage and denied‑boarding risk; more focus on strategy,
    less on monitoring.
  failure: >-
    Missed fare and inventory changes; over/under‑pricing; fare wars and margin
    erosion; lost share and ancillaries; analyst burnout; audit gaps.

  problem:
    - 'Competitive fare moves land before you see them, driving leakage.'
    - Manual scans and spreadsheets can’t cover every O&D and departure date.
    - Mispriced classes and stale fences erode RASM.

  steps:
    - >-
      Connect data: ATPCO fare feeds, PSS sales/pickup, public channel prices,
      calendars/events.
    - 'Define markets, watchlists, parity rules, and guardrails.'
