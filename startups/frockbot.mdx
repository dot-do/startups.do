  problem:
    - >-
      Rental shops lose bookings after-hours or when lines are busy; 30–50% of
      inbound inquiries happen outside staffed hours in many local retail
      categories.
    - >-
      Staff spend 15–25 hours/week on repetitive availability checks, sizing
      questions, and appointment bookings, reducing time for fittings and
      upselling.
    - >-
      Customers can’t see real-time availability by date/size/style; they
      abandon when told to call back or wait for email replies.
    - >-
      Multi-item events (weddings, theatre productions, school dances) require
      coordinating sizes, dates, and deposits across groups—manual coordination
      leads to errors and missed deadlines.
    - >-
      Existing chat widgets and generic bots don’t integrate with rental
      inventory, deposit rules, or cleaning/turnaround buffers; they deflect
      rather than convert.
    - >-
      High no-show and reservation-abandon rates due to friction in
      payment/deposit capture during inquiry flow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Embed an AI chat agent across web, Google Business Messages,
      Instagram/Facebook DMs, SMS, and WhatsApp that connects to the store’s
      live inventory and calendar.
    - >-
      Real-time availability by date/size/style, with buffer management for
      cleaning/alterations and blackout dates.
    - >-
      Guided flows for common intents: wedding party coordination, prom rentals,
      Halloween rush, theatre costume pulls, exchanges/size swaps.
    - >-
      Instant deposit capture (Stripe/Square) and automated reservation creation
      in the shop’s POS/reservation system.
    - >-
      Alternative suggestions when preferred item isn’t available (e.g., similar
      style, different color/brand, off-peak pickup/return windows).
    - >-
      Appointment booking for fittings/pickups/returns, with automated reminders
      and upsell prompts for accessories.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop escalation for complex queries; transcript and context
      sync into POS/CRM.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Convert rental inquiries into paid reservations 24/7 by checking live
    inventory by date/size/style, suggesting in-stock alternatives, coordinating
    group bookings, and capturing deposits in-chat—no phone tag, no
    spreadsheets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep rental-specific stack: real-time size/date availability, buffer-aware

    bots lack.
