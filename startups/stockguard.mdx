leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Perishable shrink from expiry and spoilage typically runs 0.8–2.0% of COGS
      in wholesale grocery, eroding margins and creating write-offs
    - >-
      Fill-rate shortfalls below 97–98% lead to lost sales, retailer penalties,
      and churn of independent grocers
    - >-
      Overstock ties up working capital, elevates DIO by 3–10 days, and
      increases carrying costs by 15–25 bps per month
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven disposition decisions are slow and
      inconsistent; opportunities for transfers, markdowns, or promotions are
      missed
    - >-
      Lot and expiration date data exist in WMS but are not used to forecast
      expiry exposure or prioritize actions across the DC network
    - >-
      Uncertain supplier lead times and retailer promotion calendars create
      demand volatility that existing forecasting tools fail to capture
    - >-
      Intra-network transfers are underutilized due to lack of
      freight-cost-aware optimization and truck/pallet constraints
    - >-
      No unified, ROI-scored playbook to compare disposition levers such as
      inter-DC transfer versus markdown versus vendor return versus salvage
    - >-
      Limited visibility to near-term stockout risk at the SKU-DC-customer
      level, causing reactive expediting and margin dilution
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack ERP, WMS, TMS, BI without a closed loop that can
      create executable orders, markdowns, or promo deals
  solution:
    - >-
      Shelf-life-aware demand forecasting at SKU-lot-DC level incorporating
      seasonality, promotions, weather, and lead-time uncertainty
    - >-
      Expiry exposure engine that quantifies units at risk by day and ranks
      actions by net profit impact
    - >-
      Optimization to propose inter-DC transfers respecting pallet, route, and
      freight costs, and to suggest markdowns or promo funding when transfer is
      suboptimal
    - >-
      Automated workflows to create transfer orders, price markdown files, and
      promo proposals back into ERP WMS systems
    - >-
      Customer-specific service-level risk scoring that flags stockouts for key
      accounts and proposes substitutions or re-allocations
    - >-
      What-if simulator to evaluate ROI of actions markdown depth, promo timing,
      transfer quantity before execution
    - >-
      Alerting and dashboards that focus users on high-value opportunities and
      measure realized savings vs baseline
    - >-
      Data quality services to reconcile lots, expiry dates, and catch missing
      or inconsistent master data
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce expired write-offs by 20–40 percent, improve DC-level fill rate by
    0.5–1.5 percentage points, and free 3–7 DIO within 90 days via an AI
    platform that converts inventory health risks into executable transfers,
    markdowns, and promotions with guaranteed ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, shelf-life-aware optimization trained on anonymized wholesale
    datasets across multiple DC networks that not only flags risk but
    automatically executes the highest-ROI transfer, markdown, or promo within
    customer guardrails, supported by prebuilt ERP WMS connectors and a 90-day
    ROI guarantee.

  character: >-
    Inventory, replenishment, and category leaders at general line grocery
    wholesalers who must hit service levels while protecting margin and cash.
  problem: >-
    External: demand swings, perishables, and multi-DC complexity create
    overstock, stockouts, and expiry exposure; Internal: teams rely on lagging
    reports and manual firefighting; Philosophical: inventory should feed
    customers, not waste cash.
  guide: >-
    We understand grocery wholesale realities (expiry, promos, vendor deals, DC
    transfers) and bring AI that surfaces risks early and prescribes actions;
    integrates with common ERPs/WMS and respects your business rules.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/WMS/PO/POS data; 2) Baseline inventory health and targets; 3)
    Daily risk scoring (overstock, stockout, expiry) with ranked actions
    (transfer, markdown, promo); 4) Route actions to buyers/planners or
    auto-apply rules; 5) Track impact and continuously tune.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and start a 60-day pilot in 1–3 DCs; Transitional: Get a
    free Inventory Health Report and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Fewer stockouts and write-offs, higher fill rates and turns, lower working
    capital, optimized markdowns and transfers, stronger retailer/vendor trust,
    planners freed from firefighting.
  failure: >-
    Without action: cash trapped in slow movers, expired write-offs, emergency
    buys and deep markdowns, missed sales, clogged DC space, eroded margins,
    unhappy retail customers.
