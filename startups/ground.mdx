leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Hub banks are fragile: a single late inbound can cascade into missed
      connections, gate conflicts, and D0/A14 penalties, especially during peak
      banks.
    - >-
      Gate planners and NOC/Station Ops lack timely, reliable predictions of
      ETA-in, taxi-in, and turn milestones to make proactive swaps or add turn
      support.
    - >-
      Gate swaps are often manual, late, or suboptimal because constraints (gate
      compatibility, towing time, crew legality, MCTs, passenger flows, de-ice,
      customs, ADA) are hard to model in real time.
    - >-
      Existing tools predict arrivals but don’t close the loop with actionable
      recommendations (ranked gate swaps, ramp staffing moves) and measured OTP
      impact.
    - >-
      Operational risk tolerance and union/contract rules make changes hard to
      adopt without auditable, explainable recommendations and clear ROI.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across ADS-B/TFMS, AODB, ACARS/OOOI, schedules
      (OAG/Cirium), gate systems, and passenger connections; stitching these
      feeds in real time is non-trivial.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ML predictions of ETA-in, taxi-in, block-to-gate, turn milestone
      timing, and tail-level risk scores (15–120 min lookahead).
    - >-
      Optimization engine that proposes ranked, constraint-compliant gate swaps
      and targeted turn interventions (e.g., extra belt loader/cleaning crew
      dispatch) to minimize misconnects and gate conflicts.
    - >-
      Passenger connection risk modeling using MCTs, live inbound/outbound
      slippage, and dynamic hub bank exposure to quantify misconnect risk and
      recovered connections.
    - >-
      What-if simulator for hub banks to test weather programs (GDP/EDCT),
      de-ice, and staffing scenarios; outputs expected OTP and misconnect
      changes.
    - >-
      Push-to-ops workflow: recommendations delivered to OCC/Station via
      existing tools (email/Teams/Slack/API, or integrated into gate manager),
      requiring single approval step with auto-notify to stakeholders.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: post-op reconciliation of OOOI, PAX connections, and
      gate timelines to retrain models and report ROI (minutes saved,
      connections protected, $ impact).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Improve hub OTP (A14/D0) by 1–3 percentage points and protect bank integrity
    by predicting arrival/turn risks 15–120 minutes ahead and recommending
    constraint-aware gate swaps and targeted turn support with one-click
    approval and auditable outcomes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, constraint-aware decisioning that not only predicts delays but
    executes safe, auditable actions across hubs. Continuous learning from
    outcome labels (accept/decline/rollback), apron-stage signals, and passenger
    connection results creates a data and workflow moat. Deep integrations with
    gate/OCC systems reduce friction and make the tool part of the daily bank
    rhythm.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Airline OCC/hub operations leaders who want to keep banks intact, minimize
    gate conflicts, and hit D0/A14 at the lowest operational cost.
  problem: >-
    Volatile arrivals, uneven turns, and scarce gates create last-minute
    conflicts; manual triage leads to cascading delays, misconnections, crew
    legality risks, and broken bank integrity.
  guide: >-
    We understand hub pressure—built by airline ops and ML experts. The service
    fuses movement, turn milestones, and surface data to predict risk, explain
    why, and recommend safe, cost-aware actions—integrating with existing gate
    and ops systems.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect flight/gate/turn data via API. 2) Calibrate on 6–8 weeks of
    history and run a 4-week hub pilot with live predictions and
    human-in-the-loop swap playbooks. 3) Scale network-wide; auto-push decisions
    to gate management with guardrails and ROI tracking.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and launch a no-commitment hub pilot with an ROI/OTP
    scorecard.
  success: >-
    Protected bank integrity; fewer gate holds/conflicts; smoother turns;
    improved D0 (+1–3pp) and A14 (+2–4pp) targets; reduced misconnections and
    reprotection costs; better crew legality protection and customer experience.
  failure: >-
    Without it: reactive swaps, congested gates, rolling delays across waves,
    higher misconnections and costs, crew disruptions, missed revenue, and
    eroded OTP and brand trust.

  problem:
    - Tight banks mean small slips cascade into gate conflicts and missed D0.
    - >-
      Static stand plans and manual calls can’t keep pace with rolling delays
      and changing constraints.
    - >-
      Late inbounds block gates; towing and last-minute swaps add cost, taxi
      time, and confusion.
    - >-
      Misconnects spike and crews go out of position, eroding OTP and customer
      experience.
    - >-
      Ops tools show data, not decisions, leaving teams without predictive,
      constraint-aware recommendations.
  solution:
    - 'Predict arrival, taxi-in, turn time, and D0 risk 4–240 minutes ahead.'
    - >-
      Surface gates at risk and propose feasible swaps and turn support actions
      in real time.
    - >-

      crew.

      Amadeus, SITA, Veovo, INFORM; alerts via Slack/Teams/Type B.
    - 'Role-based UI for OCC, station, and ramp; mobile approvals on the move.'
    - >-
      Explainable recommendations with audit trail, rollback, and governance
      controls.
    - Security-first design; read-only or write-back modes with approvals.
  steps:
    - Connect data sources and gate rules.
    - 'Calibrate to station MOGT, SLAs, and priorities.'
    - Receive predictions and swap/turn recommendations in real time.
