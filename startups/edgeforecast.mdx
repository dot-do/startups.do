leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent and lumpy demand across long-tail SKUs (specialty blades, odd
      sizes) makes simple moving averages or ERP heuristics unreliable, driving
      stockouts and overstock.
    - >-
      Lead-time variability (steel coil supply, heat treatment, coatings,
      imports) and batch/lot constraints aren’t reflected in static safety-stock
      rules, causing either excessive inventory or low service levels.
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets and disconnected ERP reports; no systematic
      service-level targeting, no bias control, and limited visibility of
      forecast error by SKU/plant/channel.
    - >-
      New product introductions, private-label variants, and seasonal
      construction cycles create frequent forecast cold-starts and model drift.
    - >-
      Cost of stockouts (lost distributor shelf space, rush freight, line
      downtime, retailer fines) and excess inventory (20–30% annual carrying
      cost, obsolescence) erode margins.
    - >-
      Existing ERP replenishment modules are generic, hard to tune for
      intermittent demand, and lack SKU-level explainability and automated
      reorder recommendations.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-level probabilistic demand forecasting optimized for
      intermittent/long-tail items; bias-controlled and seasonality-aware.
    - >-
      Automated reorder policies: reorder point, order-up-to, EOQ/lot size, and
      service-level–targeted safety stock, factoring lead-time variability and
      minimum batch sizes.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test service levels, supplier lead-time changes, and
      demand shocks before committing POs.
    - >-
      Cold-start and NPI forecasting via attribute similarity (blade diameter,
      tooth count, coating, brand, pack size, channel) and look-alike
      clustering.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon support (plant → DC → customer) with optional
      substitution/cannibalization logic for close SKUs.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: planner overrides with audit trails and reason
      codes; exception-based alerts.
    - >-
      Explainability: drivers of forecast changes (seasonality, promo, macro
      indices like PMI/housing starts), and SKU risk scores (stockout/excess
      risk).
    - >-
      Seamless ERP integration (Epicor Kinetic/Prophet 21, Infor CSI/Syteline,
      Microsoft D365 BC/F&O, SAP B1, NetSuite, Plex) via certified connectors
      and REST APIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase service level to 97–99% while reducing on-hand inventory 10–20%
    within 6–9 months by delivering SKU-plant-channel forecasts and automated
    reorder points, lot sizes, and safety stock tuned to intermittent demand and
    variable lead times—integrated directly into your ERP/MRP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt intermittent-demand models and policy engine calibrated for saw
    blades and hand tools, with out-of-the-box ERP connectors and an
    explainability layer specific to tool attributes (diameter, tooth count,
    coating, pack size) and channels—enabling 90-day pilot ROI and faster
    time-to-value than horizontal planning tools.
