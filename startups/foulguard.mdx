  problem:
    - >-
      Evaporator fouling in beet sugar plants reduces heat-transfer coefficients
      10–40% over a few days, forcing frequent CIP and causing 2–8% capacity
      loss during campaigns.
    - >-
      Cleaning is often scheduled by fixed intervals or operator intuition,
      leading to suboptimal timing: either cleaning too early (excess
      downtime/chemicals) or too late (lost throughput/steam penalties).
    - >-
      Unplanned stops for emergency cleaning can cost $10k–$50k per event in
      lost margin and overtime, plus quality risks from unstable brix and longer
      pan cycles.
    - >-
      Energy intensity rises as fouling increases; a 10% drop in overall U
      commonly increases steam per tonne sugar by 2–4%, impacting energy costs
      and CO2 footprint.
    - >-
      Plants lack effect-level fouling visibility; DCS/historian data exist but
      are not converted into actionable, economic cleaning decisions with
      crew/utility constraints.
    - >-
      CIP consumes chemicals and water (acid/alkali, 20–60 m³/event), with
      safety exposure and effluent load that must be minimized while maintaining
      capacity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Compute real-time effect-level heat-transfer performance and fouling
      resistance (Rf) from historian data (Q=U·A·ΔTlm) using physics-informed ML
      to separate process disturbances from true fouling.
    - >-
      Forecast fouling trajectories per effect (24–168 hours ahead) with
      uncertainty bounds and compute the economic optimum CIP time (clean-now vs
      wait) given current prices (steam, chemicals), product margins, and
      constraints (crew, tank availability, safety).
    - >-
      Generate a rolling cleaning plan and suggest cleaning windows aligned with
      low-load periods or scheduled stops; automatically re-optimize as
      conditions change.
    - >-
      Provide what-if simulation: impact of delaying/advancing CIP by X hours on
      throughput, steam, and campaign-end KPI.
    - >-
      Integrate with DCS/CMMS to issue work orders, reserve chemicals, and
      allocate crews; push operator advisories and interlocks (advisory-only)
      via OPC UA/PI AF notifications.
    - >-
      Continuously learn by reconciling predicted vs actual post-CIP recovery in
      U and time-to-refoul; adapt to juice quality, hardness, and process
      chemistry changes during the campaign.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predicts effect-level fouling rates and economically optimizes CIP timing to
    maximize daily slice rate and minimize steam, downtime, and
    chemicals—delivering 1–3% more throughput and 2–5% lower energy per tonne
    with payback inside one campaign.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A beet-specific, physics-informed ML engine that estimates effect-level
    fouling resistance in real time and optimizes CIP timing economically,
    reinforced by cross-plant benchmarks and OEM/chemical partnerships—difficult
    to replicate without specialized datasets and domain models.

    multi‑effect evaporators running at peak capacity through campaign.
  problem: >-
    Fouling builds unevenly by effect, slashing U‑values, raising steam/ton, and
    forcing reactive CIPs. Teams are stuck guessing when to clean and trading

    maximize tons and minimize lost time.
  guide: >-
    We understand campaign pressure and the cost of a bad CIP call. Our
    sugar‑process experts pair physics‑informed ML with plant data to predict
    per‑effect fouling and the ROI of each clean—validated on real evaporator
    trains.
