  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs and Tier-1 distributors lack real-time visibility into installed-base
      pump health, causing reactive service and escalations.
    - >-
      Warranty costs average 1–3% of equipment revenue; 20–40% of returned units
      are “no-fault-found” due to poor triage.
    - >-
      Telemetry exists (PLC/SCADA/IIoT) but is underused: data heterogeneity and
      lack of labeled failure modes impede actionable insights.
    - >-
      Service triage is slow and manual (often 1–5 days), delaying corrective
      actions and increasing downtime penalties and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Field technicians lack clear probable-cause and parts lists, driving
      repeat truck rolls (10–25% of cases) and inflated logistics costs.
    - >-
      End customers expect predictive maintenance; OEMs risk losing aftermarket
      revenue to third-party monitoring providers.
    - >-
      Disconnected systems (IoT, FSM, ERP/CRM) create swivel-chair workflows and
      lost warranty eligibility data.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion: connectors for OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus-TCP, PI
      System/AVEVA, AWS IoT SiteWise, Azure IoT Hub; schema normalization for
      common pump signals (flow, pressure, current, vibration, temp, speed).
    - >-
      Domain feature library: cavitation, dry-run, seal wear, clogging, bearing
      degradation, air entrainment, blocked suction, power-quality anomalies;
      engineered features (NPSH proxies, vibration envelopes, spectral kurtosis,
      pressure pulsation indices).
    - >-
      Hybrid ML: semi/weakly-supervised anomaly detection (isolation forest,
      autoencoders) + supervised fault classifiers using OEM fault taxonomy;
      adaptive baselining by site/operating regime; concept-drift monitoring.
    - >-
      RUL and severity scoring: estimate lead time to failure (hours/days),
      confidence intervals, and business impact (downtime/penalty risk).
    - >-
      Warranty intelligence: eligibility scoring (usage pattern, install date,
      duty cycles), probable cause (workmanship vs. misuse), and policy rules to
      qualify/deny claims with evidence snapshots.
    - >-
      Auto-triage workflows: create tickets in ServiceMax, Salesforce Service
      Cloud, SAP FSM, or Oracle with recommended actions, checklists, and parts
      kits; route by SLA/region.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: update models with ticket outcomes, parts replaced,
      and NFF results to reduce false positives over time.
    - >-
      Edge options: on-prem/edge agents for low-latency detection and bandwidth
      reduction; periodic cloud sync and fleet benchmarking.
    - >-
      Dashboards and APIs: fleet health, anomaly heatmaps, top failure modes by
      model/region, warranty cost leakage, and ROI tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce warranty spend 20–30% and cut triage time 70% by turning pump
    telemetry into automatic anomaly detection, cause classification, and
    service/warranty tickets with recommended actions—deployed in 90 days and
    integrated with your FSM/ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop warranty triage specifically for pumps: a proprietary fault
    taxonomy and labeled dataset tying telemetry patterns to verified warranty
    outcomes, plus deep FSM/ERP integrations that most horizontal IoT/AI
    platforms lack—delivering faster time-to-value and measurable warranty
    savings.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Service, aftermarket, and warranty leaders at measuring, dispensing, and
    other pump OEMs who need to maximize uptime, reduce warranty leakage, and
    scale support across a growing connected installed base.
  problem: >-
    External: noisy/missing telemetry, manual triage, slow root-cause analysis,
    and reactive truck rolls inflate warranty costs. Internal: teams are
    overwhelmed and blind to emerging failures. Philosophical: field data should
    prevent downtime—not create busywork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we know alarm fatigue and NFF returns. Authority: AI built on pump
    physics plus labeled service history; deployed across large installed bases;
    secure (SOC 2) with OEM-ready integrations. Proof: measurable cuts in MTTR
    and warranty spend in pilots and rollouts.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest telemetry (SCADA/MQTT/OPC UA/cloud) and service/warranty
    data (CMMS/ERP/CRM). 2) Learn: train anomaly + cause-classification models
    with your history and domain rules. 3) Monitor: detect abnormal behavior and
    assign likely cause and warranty disposition. 4) Act: auto-create tickets
    with recommended actions/parts/priority, routed to the right queue. 5)
    Improve: human-in-the-loop feedback closes the loop and updates models.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30-minute demo to scope a 4–6 week pilot on a subset of your
    installed base. Transitional: download a sample anomaly report and ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Proactive service at scale: 20–40% faster triage, 30–50% fewer emergency
    dispatches, 10–20% lower warranty costs, higher uptime and CSAT, cleaner
    cause codes for engineering, and new predictive service offerings.
  failure: >-
    Without it: ongoing unplanned downtime, warranty leakage and NFF truck
    rolls, missed recalls, eroding margins, technician burnout, and lost
    customers.

  problem:
    - >-
      Failures are detected late; alarm floods and static thresholds miss
      evolving conditions.
    - Manual triage consumes experts’ time and doesn’t scale across the fleet.
    - 'Warranty claims lack evidence—good units get replaced, bad actors persist.'
    - >-
      Telemetry is siloed (PLC/SCADA/IoT); no fleetwide view of health or
      failure modes.

      pump-specific patterns.
    - >-
      Classify likely causes: cavitation, seal wear, clogging, bearing wear, air
