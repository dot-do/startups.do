    - Owners
  triggers:
    - Inbound email/webform submission

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive in unstructured emails and attachments; manual rekeying into
      MIS/estimators takes 15–60 minutes per quote, creating backlogs.
    - >-
      Estimator labor is costly ($30–$45/hour loaded) and scarce; shops struggle
      to staff for peaks, causing slow response and lost deals.
    - >-
      Inconsistent spec capture (e.g., stock, coatings, imposition, finishing)
      leads to rework, margin leakage, and production surprises.
    - >-
      Quotes are often late (same day or multi-day) vs. competitors’ 1–2 hour
      turnarounds, lowering win rates.
    - >-
      Estimating rules live in people’s heads or spreadsheets; tribal knowledge
      risk when key staff are out or leave.
    - >-
      Sales asks for alternatives (quantities, substrates, lead-times) that take
      extra cycles, so upsell opportunities are missed.
    - >-
      Lead-time commitments are made without capacity context, causing schedule
      strain or rush costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI intake: Parse emails and attachments (PDF, AI, IDML, XLSX) to extract
      specs like size, pages, colors, stock, coatings, finishing, variable data,
      bleed, quantities, ship-to.
    - >-
      Cost model engine: Apply shop-specific rates (press time, makeready,
      plates/clicks, spoilage, finishing, packaging, freight) and price breaks.
    - >-
      Alternative generation: Offer quantity ladders, substrate substitutions,
      digital vs. offset/large-format options, coating/finishing variations, and
      rush/standard lead-times.
    - >-
      Capacity-aware lead-time: Pull from schedule/MIS to forecast realistic
      ship dates; flag rush feasibility and cost.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: Confidence scoring highlights
      missing/ambiguous specs; estimators approve/edit before sending.
    - >-
      Quote document composer: Branded proposals with terms, options, and
      dynamic shipping; push to CRM/MIS and email.
    - >-
      Analytics: Track turnaround time, win rate, margin variance, estimator
      time saved, and SLA adherence.
    - >-
      Integrations: Bi-directional sync with MIS (EFI/Avanti/PrintIQ/PrintVis),
      CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce), email (M365/Gmail), paper merchants’ pricing,
      and freight rating APIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn inbound RFQs into accurate, margin-protected quotes in
    minutes—auto-extracted from emails/files—with smart alternatives and
    real-time lead-times. Target outcomes: 60–80% faster quoting, ±2–3% variance
    vs. approved cost model, 5–15% higher win rate, and 20–40% estimator time
    savings.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound learning loop on specialized print data (RFQs→quotes→actuals)
    across multiple shops, combined with deep MIS integrations and
    print-specific heuristics (imposition/ganging, spoilage, finishing curves).
    This drives superior spec recall and margin fidelity that generic AI or
    spreadsheet-based estimating cannot match.

    Print shop owners, estimators, and CSRs in Commercial Printing (NAICS
    323111) who must turn messy RFQs into fast, accurate quotes without killing
    margins.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as unstructured emails/files; specs are incomplete;
    variables (substrates, presses, finishing) are complex; manual quoting is
    slow and error‑prone.

    Internal: Constant time pressure, fear of underquoting, lost bids, and
    burnout from parsing details.

    Philosophical: Skilled teams shouldn’t waste hours reading emails—buyers
    deserve clear, fair quotes in minutes.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand estimating is high‑stakes, deadline‑driven, and
    detail‑heavy.

    Authority: Built with commercial print know‑how; extracts specs from
    emails/files, models press/finishing/waste, and aligns to your price tables
    and policies; integrates with MIS/CRM; transparent math and
    human‑in‑the‑loop review.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect inbox/folders and pricing rules.

    2) AI extracts specs, flags gaps, and proposes pricing.

    3) Review quote with alternatives (substrate, press, qty breaks) and
    lead‑times.

    4) Send to customer or push to MIS/CRM.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Keep data secure and private.

    - You control final pricing and approvals.

    - Clear audit trail of assumptions and calculations.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot on real RFQs.

    snapshot.
  success: |-
    - Quotes in minutes with consistent, defensible pricing.
    - Higher win rates and protected margins.
    - Automatic alternates and realistic lead‑times.
    - Less overtime; estimators focus on strategy, not parsing.
    - Clean handoff to production with complete specs and assumptions.
  failure: |-
    - Slow responses that lose deals.
    - Margin leakage from missed specs and manual errors.
    - Estimators buried in inboxes instead of winning work.
    - Confusing quotes and shaky lead‑time promises that frustrate buyers.
