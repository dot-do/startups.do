  problem:
    - >-
      Static pricing by zip/flat-rate tables fails to reflect
      day-of-week/seasonal lane demand, causing 5–10 percentage points margin
      leakage in peak periods and underutilization off-peak.
    - >-
      Manual dispatching (whiteboards/Excel) yields 15–30% deadhead miles,
      60–75% truck utilization, and frequent overtime due to suboptimal
      job-to-crew assignments.
    - >-
      Poor visibility into lane-level contribution margin (fuel, labor,
      accessorials) leads to accepting unprofitable jobs and rejecting
      profitable ones.
    - >-
      Lack of predictive capacity/demand planning causes last-minute
      subcontracting or cancellations that erode CSAT and brand reputation.
    - >-
      Operators lack an easy way to A/B test prices and measure quote-to-book
      conversion by lane and channel, slowing growth.
  solution:
    - >-
      Lane demand and capacity forecasting at the lane x day-of-week x
      time-window level using historical bookings, quotes, and external signals
      (seasonality, events, fuel).
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing engine: suggests price bands per lane/service level to hit
      target utilization and margin, with guardrails (min margin, competitor
      index, price fairness).
    - >-
      Constraint-aware dispatch optimizer (MILP/CP-SAT): assigns jobs to
      trucks/crews minimizing deadhead/overtime while respecting time windows,
      skills, HOS/ELD, building access constraints.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test new prices, add/remove trucks/crews, shift
      windows; see impact on utilization, margin, and on-time performance before
      going live.
    - >-
      Quote scoring and prioritization: flags unprofitable or risky jobs;
      recommends upsells (packing, crating, stair carry) based on predicted
      effort.
    - >-
      Live dispatch board and crew mobile workflow integration (via existing
      apps) for turn-by-turn, punch-in/out, delays, and exception handling.
    - >-
      Automated re-optimization: adapts to same-day cancellations, traffic, or
      crew overruns; suggests swaps with customer communication templates.
    - >-
      Analytics: lane-level P&L, conversion funnels, and cohort benchmarks vs.
      peers (privacy-safe).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase revenue per truck-day by 10–15% and reduce deadhead miles by 15–25%
    with AI-driven lane pricing and constraint-aware dispatch, integrated to
    your TMS within 30 days and governed by your margin targets and service
    windows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-fleet dataset of lane demand, costs, and realized margins
    enables superior forecasts and price elasticities; combined with a
    dispatcher-friendly optimizer tailored to moving-specific constraints
    (stairs/elevators, accessorials, HOS, crew skills) and deep TMS
    integrations, we deliver measurable gains within weeks that are hard to
    replicate with generic tools.

    Operations and sales leaders at HHG and office moving companies who need to
    fill trucks, schedule crews right, and hit margin targets on every lane.
  problem: >-
    - External: Under/over-booked trucks, idle time or overtime, empty miles,
    and inconsistent lane pricing.

    constraints, and margin/utilization goals.

    2) Calibrate: Train on history and live bookings; simulate lanes, crews,
    trucks, and time windows.

    3) Go live: Daily job-to-truck/crew assignments and dynamic lane price
    bands; one-click accept, API/auto-apply, and weekly performance tune-ups.
