leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile and complex energy tariffs (time-of-use, day-ahead spot, peak
      demand charges) drive unpredictable and rising energy costs for kiln and
      germination operations.
    - >-
      Static or rule-based batch scheduling cannot reliably exploit low-tariff
      windows while meeting due dates and quality specifications (moisture,
      color/EBC, friability).
    - >-
      Manual planning (spreadsheets, whiteboards) creates bottlenecks, overtime,
      and conflict between production planners and energy managers, especially
      across multiple kilns/germination vessels and CIP windows.
    - >-
      Lack of predictive visibility into energy consumption by phase and ambient
      conditions (temperature/humidity) leads to suboptimal setpoints and
      unnecessary reheats/airflow energy.
    - >-
      Decarbonization pressure (Scope 1/2) requires measurable CO2 intensity
      reduction per tonne; current systems lack optimization against carbon
      signal or PPA availability.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven batch start-time and phase-duration optimization across
      germination and kiln assets, constrained by due dates, capacity, CIP
      windows, and quality guardrails.
    - >-
      Forecast-driven engine that ingests day-ahead tariffs/DR signals and
      ambient conditions to plan and re-plan schedules every 15–60 minutes.
    - >-
      Plant-specific digital twin of energy and quality: predictive models for
      moisture, color (EBC/SRM), friability, and energy use per phase
      (steep/germination/rest/kiln) to ensure quality preservation.
    - >-
      Closed-loop implementation via SCADA/MES: push setpoint schedules and
      interlocks; enable operator approval workflow with override tracking.
    - >-
      Peak demand and carbon-aware modes: actively shape load to avoid demand
      charges and reduce CO2 intensity when carbon prices or PPAs/RECs apply.
    - >-
      Scenario planning (“what if”): simulate tariff curves, outages, or rush
      orders and quantify cost/quality impact pre-execution.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut malt kiln/germination energy cost per tonne by 5–12% within 90 days,

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Malt house operations leaders who must hit malt quality specs and delivery
    dates while lowering energy spend.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile energy prices and rigid kiln/germination phase windows;
    Internal: constant schedule firefighting and trade-offs; Philosophical: you
    shouldn’t have to choose between quality and energy cost.
  guide: >-
    We understand malting and energy markets, and we’ve built AI schedulers for
    industrial plants. The Kiln/Germination Energy Cost Optimizer shifts batch
    starts and phase timings within SOP spec bands to avoid peaks, cut cost, and
    protect due dates.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect tariffs, orders, equipment capacities, and SOP spec bands; 2)
    Configure constraints and quality limits; 3) Run a 4-week pilot to
    calibrate; 4) Go live with daily optimized start times and phase setpoints,
    operator override, and savings reports.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute ROI consult and launch a pilot on one kiln.
  success: >-
    Double-digit energy cost reduction, protected quality and on-time delivery,
    calmer shifts, and a scalable, data-driven schedule across kilns and
    germination.
  failure: >-
    Keep overpaying during peak hours, risking late lots or spec drift, and
    burning out teams with last-minute schedule changes.
