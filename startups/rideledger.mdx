  problem:
    - >-
      Manual trip-to-invoice reconciliation for corporate accounts is slow (4–10
      minutes per trip) and error-prone, delaying billing cycles and cash flow.
    - >-
      Cost-center and GL coding varies by client and changes frequently;
      maintaining mapping rules across affiliates and dispatch systems is
      brittle and creates disputes.
    - >-
      Corporate clients expect e-receipts within hours (often <24 hours) with
      detailed line items (tolls, wait time, surcharges); inconsistencies
      trigger chargebacks and AP rejections.
    - >-
      Rate tables, SLAs, and contract exceptions are complex (after-hours,
      airport fees, city rules); operators struggle to apply the right rules at
      scale.
    - >-
      Affiliate farm-in/out introduces fragmented data formats and
      duplicate/partial trips, increasing manual effort to consolidate and
      reconcile.
    - >-
      Limited integrations between dispatch, accounting (QBO/NetSuite), and
      expense platforms (Concur/Coupa) cause double entry and spreadsheet
      workarounds.
    - >-
      Audit requirements (SOC 2-style controls from enterprise clients) are
      growing, but many operators lack traceability and change logs for billing.
    - >-
      Finance teams lack visibility into KPIs like DSO by client, dispute rates,
      and automation coverage, hampering continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline that ingests trips from dispatch systems and
      affiliate feeds; normalizes, deduplicates, and validates records.
    - >-
      Contract-aware rating engine applies negotiated rate tables, surcharges,
      SLAs (wait time, after-hours), taxes/fees per jurisdiction.
    - >-
      AI cost-center/GL classifier trained per corporate account; continuous
      learning from approvals/edits to reach 98%+ coding accuracy.
    - >-
      Automated e-receipts and invoice generation with client-specific
      templates; pushes to SAP Concur, Coupa, Workday, NetSuite, QuickBooks
      Online, Sage Intacct.
    - >-
      Exception queue with root-cause hints (missing PO, anomalous wait time,
      duplicate trip) to minimize manual touches.
    - >-
      Audit-ready logs and policy controls (who changed what, when) to meet
      enterprise compliance requirements.
    - >-
      Dashboards showing DSO, automation rate, dispute rate, time-to-receipt,
      and revenue leakage detection.
    - >-
      Optional payment links and auto-reminders (ACH/card) to accelerate
      collections.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
