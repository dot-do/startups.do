  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts and missed reservations cause lost revenue and churn; typical
      fill-rate at location/SKU level is 85–92% versus target 97%+.
    - >-
      Idle or wrong-location inventory ties up capital; 15–30% of fleet sits
      underutilized while nearby locations stock out.
    - >-
      Manual planning (Excel + gut feel) can’t scale across 100s of SKUs, 10–500
      locations, promotions, and seasonal spikes (Back-to-School, Diwali,
      Holidays).
    - >-
      Transfers are ad hoc and costly; no network-wide view of least-cost moves
      subject to truck capacity, time windows, and SLA constraints.
    - >-
      New SKU launches and discontinuations create cold-start forecasting errors
      and overbuying; lead-time variability and MOQs further degrade plans.
    - >-
      Returns/refurbishment pipeline and failure rates are not modeled, leading
      to surprises in available-to-promise and service gaps.
    - >-
      Procurement plans ignore price breaks, vendor SLAs, and capital limits;
      purchases are made late or at suboptimal cost.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (ERP, POS, WMS, asset tracking) limit visibility;
      planners spend hours reconciling data not improving decisions.
    - >-
      Executives lack measurable ROI from planning; no closed-loop measurement
      of forecast accuracy, service levels, and working capital.
    - >-
      Sustainability targets (CO2, reverse logistics) are rising but transfer
      decisions don’t quantify emissions trade-offs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Probabilistic SKU-by-location forecasts (daily/weekly) that model
      seasonality, promotions, holidays, weather, and local demographics;
      stockout-censoring and cold-start handling for new SKUs.
    - >-
      Service-level optimization: recommend safety stocks to meet target
      fill-rates (e.g., 97–99%) with minimum capital tied up.
    - >-
      Fleet rebalancing optimizer: network flow + vehicle routing to generate
      least-cost transfer plans subject to truck capacity, store hours, and SLA
      windows; includes emissions cost as optional constraint.
    - >-
      Purchase planning: reorder proposals by vendor considering lead times,
      MOQs, price breaks, capital budgets, and refurbishment returns pipeline.
    - >-
      Returns/refurbishment modeling: failure rates and turnaround times
      incorporated into available-to-promise and capacity plans.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: simulate promotions, price changes, and macro shocks;
      compare cost, service level, and CO2 outcomes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: API and UI to create transfer orders and POs; track
      acceptance and fulfillment; learn from outcomes to reduce bias/drift.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: feature importance, demand drivers, and confidence
      intervals; user overrides tracked with audit trails.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors for NetSuite, Acumatica, Microsoft Dynamics 365,
      EZRentOut, Asset Panda, Snowflake, S3, Shopify, custom SFTP.
    - >-
      Governance and security: role-based access, SOC 2 roadmap, PII
      minimization; full activity logs for compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit 97–99% service levels with 15–30% less working capital by predicting
    SKU-by-location demand and automatically recommending the lowest-cost
    transfers and purchases—measurable ROI in 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rental-native models that capture returns/refurbishment cycles and asset
    aging, combined with a closed-loop optimizer that directly creates transfer
    orders and POs. Cross-tenant benchmarks and ROI-backed pilots create a data
    and credibility moat; partnerships with rental ERPs accelerate distribution.
