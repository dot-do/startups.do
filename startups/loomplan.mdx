leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers rely on spreadsheets/ERP heuristics that don’t model
      color/pattern changeover costs, causing 10–25% lost capacity and frequent
      lateness.
    - >-
      Rush orders and rework disrupt plans; re-scheduling takes 2–6 hours and
      destabilizes upstream tufting/loom and downstream finishing.
    - >-
      Complex constraints (loom gauge, beam availability, dye lot,
      pattern/width, latex cure times, drying capacity, shearing/inspection
      staffing, maintenance windows) are not holistically modeled, leading to
      infeasible schedules.
    - >-
      High changeover time (color/pattern/backing swaps) consumes 10–35% of
      available time on many lines.
    - >-
      Poor visibility of WIP and routings creates bottlenecks (queues at drying
      ovens/inspection) and excess WIP days.
    - >-
      Planners lack what-if tools; decisions are opinion-based, not KPI-driven
      (makespan, OTD, utilization).
    - >-
      ERP/MES native schedulers are generic; custom rules are costly and brittle
      to maintain.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and material shortages are not handled with fast,
      incremental re-optimization, causing missed due dates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud-based APS optimizer combining CP-SAT/MILP with domain-specific
      heuristics and changeover matrices for color/pattern/backing to minimize
      setup/lateness cost.
    - >-
      Digital twin of plant: machines, routings, calendars, labor/skill,
      maintenance, material/beam/dye lot constraints, buffers, cure/dry times,
      and quality gates.
    - >-
      Rolling-horizon scheduling (e.g., 1–4 weeks) with 15–60 min buckets;
      incremental re-optimization in <2 minutes for disruptions.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if: compare 3–5 candidate schedules by KPIs
      (OTD, changeover hours, makespan, utilization, overtime).
    - >-
      Rush-order insertion with automated impact analysis and recommended
      trade-offs (overtime vs resequencing).
    - >-
      Integrated KPI cockpit and Gantt boards; mobile/TV floor views (frozen
      zones, lock/unlock ops).
    - >-
      Connectors to SAP PP/DS, Infor M3, D365, generic CSV/API; optional OT
      connectors for machine states and counters.
    - >-
      Auditability and explainability: why-this-sequence because-of color
      family, width, beam readiness, or due-date penalty; user-adjustable rules
      with guardrails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Constraint-aware, explainable AI that sequences tufting/loom and finishing
    to minimize changeovers and lateness, delivering 5–15% throughput lift,
    20–40% fewer changeover hours, and 90–98% on-time delivery within 12
    weeks—integrated to your ERP/MES with rapid pilot and clear ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific changeover and routing library for carpet/rug
    manufacturing, combined with an explainable, incremental solver that
    re-optimizes in minutes; prebuilt ERP/MES connectors and OEM relationships
    shorten time-to-value. Accumulated benchmark setup matrices and case studies
    from multiple mills create a data moat and high switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers and schedulers at carpet and rug mills who must coordinate
    tufting/loom lines and finishing to hit ship dates.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile order mix, complex changeovers, shared resources, and
    downstream constraints create late jobs and idle time. Internal: nonstop
    firefighting and spreadsheet chaos. Philosophical: delivering on time
    shouldn’t require heroics or guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill scheduling pressure—rush orders, dye lots, widths, and
    pattern changeovers. Our team blends textile manufacturing experience with
    operations research and AI, with deployments that cut changeovers and
    lateness.
  plan: >-
    1) Discovery: map routings, constraints, changeover rules; connect ERP/MES.
    2) Pilot: run the optimizer on live orders, review KPIs, refine rules. 3)
    Rollout: review/approve workflow, daily re-optimizations, training and
    support.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot. Transitional: Send
    last month’s orders to receive a sample schedule and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Constraint-aware, synchronized loom and finishing schedules; fewer
    changeovers; higher on-time delivery; balanced utilization; lower overtime
    and WIP; predictable lead times; confident customer promises.
  failure: >-
    Persistent late shipments, excess changeovers and overtime, whipsawing
    priorities, idle machines waiting on the wrong work, frustrated teams, and
    lost business.
