  problem:
    - >-
      Manual DFM and tolerance feasibility reviews for turned parts are slow
      (1–4 hours per drawing) and error-prone, delaying quotes and engineering
      release.
    - >-
      Risky tolerances and weak datum schemes are often discovered at
      first-article or during production, causing scrap, rework, late
      deliveries, and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Shops lack quantified, machine-specific capability guidance (Cp/Cpk by
      feature, material, tooling, and lot size), relying on tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Iterative OEM–supplier loops over unmanufacturable features inflate
      supplier onboarding times and quote win/loss cycles.
    - >-
      Tolerance stack-ups and GD&T interpretation are inconsistently applied
      across teams; many engineers are not expert in ASME Y14.5/ISO GPS.
    - >-
      Quality planning (inspection method, gage selection, sampling) is
      disconnected from design and process capability, creating over- or
      under-inspection.
    - >-
      SMBs lack affordable tools; enterprise solutions are complex, 3D-CAD
      centric, and not optimized for high-throughput turned parts.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered parsing of 2D drawings and 3D models to extract geometry, GD&T,
      surface finish, threads, and notes specific to turning operations.
    - >-
      Tolerance feasibility scoring per feature based on
      machine/process/tool/material capability models with Cp/Cpk predictions
      and recommended alternate tolerances/finishes.
    - >-
      Rapid stack-up and datum analysis (Monte Carlo/analytical) with risk
      heatmaps and sensitivity to tolerance modifications.
    - >-
      Process-aware DFM recommendations: tool access, reliefs, chamfers,
      undercuts, corner radii, fillet sizes, knurling guidance, cutoff/parting
      considerations, secondary ops (grind/hone).
    - >-
      Inspection plan autopilot: suggested measurement methods, gauges, sampling
      plans, and cost/time trade-offs aligned to risk.
    - >-
      Quote support: generate manufacturability summary, risks, and suggested
      quote notes; integrate to quoting systems to reduce back-and-forth.
    - >-
      Continuous learning from shop outcomes: closed-loop improvement using SPC,
      NCRs, and FAI results to refine capability models per machine and feature
      type.
    - >-
      Deployment flexibility: secure cloud, private VPC, or on-prem for
      ITAR/EAR-controlled data; SOC 2-ready controls.
    - >-
      Native integrations with CAD (SolidWorks, NX, Inventor), CAM (Mastercam,
      Esprit, Fusion), PLM (Teamcenter, Windchill), and quoting (Paperless
      Parts).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, machine-capability-aware DFM and tolerance risk review for turned
    parts that cuts quote and release time by 50–70%, flags unachievable
    tolerances before build, and quantifies risk with Cp/Cpk-backed
    recommendations tied to real shop capability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Machine- and feature-specific capability models trained on anonymized, real
    shop SPC and outcome data for turned parts, producing quantified
    Cp/Cpk-backed risk scores and recommendations that general DFM tools and 3D
    tolerance suites do not provide. Secure ITAR-capable deployment plus a fast,
    accurate GD&T parser tuned to 2D drawings common in turning workflows.
