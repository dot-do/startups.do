  problem:
    - >-
      Builders struggle to consistently hit both margin targets (e.g., 22–28%
      gross margin) and sales pace targets (e.g., 2–6 sales per community per
      month) due to imperfect plan mix, lot sizing, and release phasing
      decisions.
    - >-
      Decisions are made with partial data and static spreadsheets, ignoring
      real-time demand elasticity, site constraints, construction capacity,
      financing costs, and municipal phasing requirements.
    - >-
      Misaligned mix and phasing lead to measurable value leakage: 50–300 bps
      margin loss, 0.5–1.5 fewer sales per community per month, 1–3 months
      additional carry on certain lots, and 10–20% higher incentives to clear
      aged inventory.
    - >-
      Replatting, late plan changes, and unplanned spec starts increase costs
      (survey, engineering, fees, rework) and delay approvals by weeks to
      months.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (CAD/Civil, ERP, CRM, BI) make it hard to run fast
      “what-if” scenarios that align land, sales, operations, and finance
      constraints.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest site plans, constraints, and demand signals to build a digital twin
      of each community/division.
    - >-
      Estimate price/pace elasticity by plan/elevation/options using historical
      sales, incentives, traffic, interest rates, and comps.
    - >-
      Optimize lot widths/depths, plan allocations per phase, price ladders,
      incentives, and start cadence to meet margin and absorption goals while
      respecting municipal and operational constraints.
    - >-
      Provide an execution plan: release sequence, start schedule, spec vs.
      to-be-built ratio, and inventory thresholds with alerts.
    - >-
      Continuously re-forecast and re-optimize monthly or on key triggers (rate
      moves, traffic changes, cost updates) to minimize slippage from targets.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven scenario planning that co-optimizes plan mix, lot sizes, and
    release phasing under real-world constraints to hit both margin and pace
    targets—quantified, defendable, and executable in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built constraint/optimization engine trained on builder-grade data
    and constraints (plan widths, setbacks, phase caps, trade capacity) plus an
    anonymized cross-builder dataset that yields superior elasticity
    estimates—combined with deep ERP/CAD integrations that general analytics
    providers lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    New home for-sale builders (NAICS 236117) who must hit margin and sales-pace
    targets for each community while navigating site, entitlement, and capital
    constraints.
  problem: >-
    - External: Complex sites, mixed lot widths/depths, utility and access
    limits, volatile demand and rates, competing inventory.

    - Internal: Guesswork and spreadsheets drive plan mix and phasing; hard to
    align sales, ops, land, and finance on one optimal scenario.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to gamble millions on mix and
    phasing—every release should be data-driven and defensible.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to deliver absorption without eroding margin.
    Lot/Plan Mix & Phasing Optimizer is built by former builders, land planners,
    and data scientists to model real-world constraints and demand. We’ve helped
    builders replace guesswork with transparent, scenario-based decisions that
    stakeholders trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Share inputs: site plan and constraints, lot standards, plan library,
    costs, pricing, sales history, targets.

    2) We simulate scenarios to optimize plan mix, lot sizes, pricing bands, and
    phase boundaries; you get ranked recommendations with projected margin and
    pace.

    3) Approve and launch; we monitor weekly performance and adjust phasing and
    mix as conditions change. Optional: start with a one-community pilot and
    success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo to review your community. Transitional:
    Request a one-site pilot or download a sample optimization report.
  success: >-
    Right plans on the right lots, faster absorption at target margins, fewer
    incentives, smoother cash flow, fewer redesigns/replats, clear phase
    releases, and greater confidence with lenders, investors, and
    municipalities.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams over/under-supply product, strand lots, rely on
    discounts, carry excess costs, miss pro formas, slip schedules, and erode
    brand trust with buyers and stakeholders.

    subtitle: >-
      For new housing for-sale builders. Hit margin and pace targets by
      optimizing plan mix, lot sizes, and phasing—within real site and demand
      constraints.

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Misaligned plan mix stalls absorption and erodes margin.
    - Spreadsheets lag cost swings and shifting buyer demand.
    - 'Phasing misses utility, road, and permit gates, tying up capital.'
    - Wrong lot sizes force incentives or redesign midstream.
    - 'Disconnected market, cost, and sales data drive guesswork.'
    - Release sizing is guesswork—too slow or leaves money on the table.
  solution:
    - 'AI aligns plan mix, lot sizes, and phasing to your targets.'
    - Models demand and price elasticity by product and lot attributes.
    - 'Enforces zoning, frontage, setback, utility, and grading constraints.'
    - 'Sequences phases to match permits, trades, and cash flow needs.'
    - 'Guardrails for margin, absorption, IRR; auto-alerts on variance.'
    - 'Pushes outputs to pro forma, schedules, and sales release plans.'
  features:
    - >-
      Constraint engine: setbacks, frontage, easements, topography, utilities,
      roads.

    - 'Lot-fit: auto-fit plans; right-size widths, depths, and elevations.'
    - 'Price/pace optimizer for ASP, gross margin, and absorption goals.'
    - Phasing builder with permit and infrastructure prerequisites.
    - Options take-rate and cycle-time impact modeling on margins.
    - 'Scenario sandbox with IRR, NPV, cash curve, and inventory turns.'
    - 'Release strategy: tranche sizing, spec mix, and incentive guardrails.'

    - Upload site plan and cost assumptions.
    - 'Set pace, margin, and ASP targets.'
    - Connect market data or use built-in feeds.
    - 'Run optimize; review mix, lot sizes, and phasing.'
