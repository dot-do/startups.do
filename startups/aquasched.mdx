leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High changeover time due to SKU proliferation (bottle size, cap color,
      label, still/sparkling, flavored) causes 10–25% of weekly available line
      time to be lost.
    - >-
      Manual scheduling struggles to respect complex constraints (CIP/cleaning,
      CO2 vs still, flavor/allergen cross-contact, tank changeovers,
      labor/skills, maintenance windows, warehouse capacity).
    - >-
      Frequent rescheduling from demand fluctuations and upstream material
      delays leads to poor schedule adherence (<80%) and OT costs.
    - >-
      Lack of scenario planning results in suboptimal decisions (e.g., batching
      by customer due dates vs. minimizing sequence-dependent setups).
    - >-
      KPIs like OEE, on-time-in-full, and CIP resource consumption
      (water/chemicals/energy) are not optimized together, leaving savings
      untapped.
    - >-
      Planner time spent on schedule creation and firefighting (6–12
      hrs/week/plant) reduces focus on continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Purpose-built optimization engine (MILP/CP hybrid) modeling
      sequence-dependent setup times for bottle/cap/label/flavor/CO2 changes and
      sanitation/CIP requirements.
    - >-
      Constraint library for beverage plants: still vs sparkling,
      flavor/sweetener and allergen classes (where applicable), tank
      availability, filler rate curves, packaging material availability, labor
      skills/shift rules, maintenance windows, warehouse capacity and truck
      pickup cutoffs.
    - >-
      Data integration with ERP/MES/CMMS (e.g., SAP PP/DS, Oracle, Microsoft
      D365, Opcenter, Ignition, PI System) for demand, BOMs, inventory, work
      centers, and downtime plans.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: compare “least changeover,” “OT-minimizing,” and
      “due-date OTIF-maximizing” schedules with quantified KPIs per scenario.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: publish schedules to MES, capture actuals,
      auto-learn setup times, and improve models weekly.
    - >-
      Explainability and what-if tools so planners can pin jobs, lock windows,
      and watch the optimizer re-sequence around constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weekly production schedules that meet demand, cut changeovers by 25–40%,
    respect all food safety and labor constraints, and increase line OEE by 3–6
    points—generated in minutes with explainable trade-offs and one-click
    deployment to the floor.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A beverage-specific optimization engine with proprietary setup/CIP matrices

  character: >-
    Operations leaders and planners at bottled water manufacturers who must meet
    weekly demand at the lowest cost while keeping lines compliant,
    labor-balanced, and efficient.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile orders, SKU proliferation (sizes and pack formats),
    sequence‑dependent changeovers (bottle size, cap color, label),
    sanitation/CIP windows, labor and maintenance constraints, dock/pickup
    slots, differing line speeds.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting in spreadsheets, weekend reschedules,
    uncertainty about what’s actually feasible.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between service and
    sanity—your schedule should respect reality and run with confidence.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the stress of balancing service, sanitation, and shift
    limits on high‑throughput lines.

    - Authority: Built by ex-planners and OR engineers using proven optimization
    and simulation, configured for real plant constraints and changeover logic.
  plan: >-
    - 1) Connect: Pull forecast/orders, inventory, SKUs, BOMs/routings, line
    calendars, changeover matrix, labor skills, maintenance windows.

    - 2) Configure: Set service targets, lot sizes, sequence rules,
    CIP/cleaning, labor and shift policies, changeover penalties.

    - 3) Run: Generate the weekly master schedule, simulate what‑ifs, publish to
    ERP/MES, and re-optimize as things change.

    - Pilot: 4–6 week pilot on one plant with agreed success criteria (service
    adherence, changeover hours, overtime, schedule stability).
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a pilot.

    - Transitional: Request a sample schedule and ROI snapshot; get a
    changeover‑matrix template.
  success: |-
    - Reliable weekly plan that hits service targets.
    - Fewer changeovers and CIPs; longer runs and higher throughput.
    - Predictable shifts and lower overtime; happier crews.
    - Compliance and auditability built into every schedule.
    - More cases out the door without new capex.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing firefighting, missed orders, overtime blowouts, quality/sanitation
    risks, whiplash schedules, morale erosion, and costly expedites or carrying
    costs.
