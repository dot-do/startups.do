  problem:
    - >-
      Structural steel and precast teams lose 6–12 hours/week per engineer
      drafting RFIs due to unclear drawings/specs and manual evidence
      collection.
    - >-
      Ambiguities and conflicts slip until detailing/fabrication/erection,
      triggering change orders, rework, and schedule delays (typical $5k–$25k
      per avoidable issue).
    - >-
      Existing tools (Procore/ACC/Bluebeam) manage RFIs but don’t find issues or
      draft designer-ready RFIs.
    - >-
      Cross-referencing 2D sheets, 3D models, and specs is manual and
      error-prone; detailers must trace callouts and details across revisions.
    - >-
      Small/mid contractors lack dedicated VDC/coordination resources to
      systematically scan documents for inconsistencies.
    - >-
      RFI quality varies; poorly framed RFIs cause multiple back-and-forth
      cycles and slow responses from designers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Simple import: upload PDFs (plans/specs), models (IFC/Revit/Tekla), and
      revisions; auto-index and version control.
    - >-
      Automated detection: identify dimension mismatches, missing embeds/plates,
      inconsistent elevations/levels, conflicting connection details,
      spec/drawing discrepancies, and missing references.
    - >-
      Prioritized issue list with severity, impacted sheets/details, and
      estimated cost/schedule risk.
    - >-
      Auto-drafted RFIs: pre-filled metadata, linked spec sections, annotated
      snapshots/clouds, and 1–3 suggested resolutions aligned with AISC/PCI +
      project standards.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review with checklists; one-click publish to
      Procore/Autodesk/Email with correct RFI numbering and routing.
    - >-
      Analytics: RFI cycle time, acceptance on first submission, cost avoidance
      estimates, and issue heatmaps by sheet/detail.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: user edits and outcomes feed back into models and
      trade-specific rulesets.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that finds structural drawing/spec conflicts and drafts ready-to-send
    RFIs with annotated snapshots, references, and suggested
    resolutions—reducing RFI cycle time and preventing costly change orders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Trade-specific multimodal models trained on proprietary structural datasets
    and PE-reviewed rulesets, tightly integrated into contractor workflows to
    produce designer-acceptable RFIs with annotated evidence—high data, domain,
    and integration moats that generalist AI lacks.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Structural steel and precast concrete contractors—estimators, PMs, and
    detailers—who want to bid confidently, coordinate early, and build without
    surprises.
  problem: >-
    Drawings and specs are inconsistent, incomplete, or conflicting, creating
    hidden RFIs that surface late—causing rework, delays, backcharges, and
    margin erosion. Internally, teams lose time chasing answers and worry about
    missing issues. Philosophically, you shouldn’t lose margin because documents
    are unclear.
  guide: >-
    RFI Drafting & Issue Finder pairs AI with steel/precast know-how. Trained on
    AISC/PCI/AWS practices and thousands of submittals, it flags conflicts early
    and drafts clean, professional RFIs with annotated snapshots and suggested
    resolutions—so your team looks buttoned-up under tight schedules.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload plans/models/specs. 2) Receive a prioritized issue log with
    annotated screenshots, references, and AI-drafted RFIs; review and edit in
    minutes. 3) Send RFIs, track responses, and sync decisions back to your
    log/BIM; export polished PDF packs.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a 2-week pilot on one package. Transitional:
    Download a sample issue report and RFI pack.
  success: >-
    Catch conflicts before fabrication and install; reduce RFI turnaround;
    prevent rework and backcharges; protect schedule and margin; submit RFIs
    that get answered the first time; win trust with GCs/engineers; deliver
    smoother installs.
  failure: >-
    Missed ambiguities become field fixes, rejected submittals, change orders
    against you, schedule slips, overtime, LDs, and write-offs—while competitors
    who clarify early look more competent.
