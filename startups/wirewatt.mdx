  problem:
    - >-
      Energy cost volatility and rising TOU/demand charges increase OPEX
      unpredictably.
    - >-
      Plants measure kWh at the facility level but lack line/product-level
      normalization (kWh per ton by diameter/grade/line), obscuring true
      performance.
    - >-
      Undetected process drift (die wear, lube degradation, mis-tension, motor
      inefficiency) can add 5–15% energy per ton before quality alarms trigger.
    - >-
      Scheduling decisions often ignore electricity pricing windows, increasing
      demand peaks and TOU costs.
    - >-
      OEM/EMS dashboards report consumption but don’t prescribe setpoints,
      product routing, or maintenance actions to cut energy per ton.
    - >-
      Hard to prove savings and secure utility incentives without statistically
      sound baselines and M&V methods.
    - >-
      Limited internal data science resources to build/maintain models and
      connectors across PLCs/SCADA/MES.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: ingest real-time power (kW/kWh) per line and
      production/quality data (tonnage, diameter, grade, die schedule) from
      PLC/SCADA/MES via OPC UA/Modbus/MQTT in 2–4 weeks.
    - >-
      Normalization models: compute Energy per Ton (EPT) by line, product,
      reduction ratio, coating, and ambient; establish statistically robust
      baselines (seasonality, shifts).
    - >-
      Drift detection: SPC-style control charts and ML residual analysis flag
      1–3% EPT deviations within hours; root-cause hints rank likely
      contributors (die wear, lube temp/viscosity, capstan slip, bearing
      friction, annealing settings).
    - >-
      Prescriptive advisor: recommends setpoint tweaks (speed/tension/cooling),
      product routing/scheduling to avoid TOU peaks, and maintenance actions
      with expected kWh/t impact and confidence.
    - >-
      Demand optimization: peak shaving and load shifting suggestions with
      forecasted tariff impact; integrate with DR programs where available.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: IPMVP-compliant baselining; automated savings reports
      for finance and utility incentives; ISO 50001-friendly KPIs and evidence.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure cloud or on-prem edge gateway; role-based
      dashboards and API to feed EMS/BI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut 8–12% electricity per ton within 90 days by normalizing kWh/t by line
    and product, detecting drift early, and prescribing setpoint, scheduling,
    and maintenance actions—measured and verified with utility-grade M&V.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built, physics-informed EPT normalization and advisory engine for
    wire drawing with pre-trained models, OEM/meter integrations, and M&V
    rigor—allowing rapid 90-day savings and utility incentive eligibility that
    generic EMS/AI tools can’t match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Steel wire drawing leaders (ops, maintenance, energy managers) who must cut
    kWh per ton and demand charges without risking throughput, draw quality, or
    delivery.
  problem: >-
    Energy costs rise while kWh/t drifts by line, die pack, product, and shift.
    Operators lack normalized targets, scheduling creates demand peaks,
    maintenance is reactive, and data is scattered—making accountability and
    savings hard.
  guide: >-
    Energy per Ton Monitor & Savings Advisor is an AI service built for NAICS
    331222. We normalize kWh/t by line and product, detect drift early, and turn
    it into clear setpoint, scheduling, and maintenance actions your team can
    trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect meters, PLC tags, and production records. 2) Baseline and
    normalize kWh/t by line, product, and shift. 3) Receive drift alerts and
    ranked recommendations (setpoints to tune, runs to reschedule, assets to
    service). 4) Review weekly impact and lock in improvements.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute assessment or start a 30‑day pilot to see verified energy
    savings per ton.
  success: >-
    Stable, lower kWh/t per line and product; fewer demand peaks; operators
    confident with recommended setpoints; proactive maintenance; visible savings
    on bills; stronger margins and ESG reporting.
  failure: >-
    Without action, kWh per ton creeps up, demand spikes inflate bills,
    equipment runs inefficiently, maintenance stays reactive, and margins erode
    as competitors run leaner.

  problem:
    - >-
      Energy is a top variable cost, but kWh/ton isn’t normalized by line or
      product—waste stays hidden.
    - >-
      Slow drifts (die wear, lube/temperature changes, annealer drift) quietly
      raise kWh/t.
    - Operators chase throughput; setpoints creep and vary by shift.
    - Peak-hour runs inflate bills and demand charges.
    - Reactive maintenance lets leaks and fouled exchangers persist.
    - Savings are hard to prove for rebates and ISO 50001 audits.
