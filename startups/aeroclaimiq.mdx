  problem:
    - >-
      Airlines face high manual workload and inconsistency in EC261/UK261, US
      DOT refund entitlements, and airline amenity/expense policies, leading to
      slow, costly claims handling.
    - >-
      Regulatory and policy updates are frequent and complex (EU case law, UK
      divergence, DOT refund final rules, airline customer service plans),
      creating compliance risk and audit gaps.
    - >-
      Overpayments (misclassification of extraordinary circumstances,
      duplicates, and policy drift) and underpayments (missed entitlements)
      drive both cost leakage and fines/chargebacks.
    - >-
      Customers experience long response times (days/weeks), low transparency,
      and language barriers, reducing NPS and increasing regulator complaints
      and social media escalation.
    - >-
      Data needed to attribute cause (ops control logs, crew, ATC, weather,
      maintenance) is fragmented across systems, complicating accurate
      eligibility decisions.
    - >-
      Fraud (synthetic claims, receipt manipulation, duplicate submissions)
      increases with scale and limited controls.
    - >-
      Payout logistics are complex across markets (SEPA, ACH, vouchers, cards,
      cross-border FX), driving delays and fees.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified claims intake via API/portal/email ingestion with auto-ID of
      PNR/ticket and passenger verification.
    - >-
      Explainable decision engine that maps flight/ops/weather/ATC data to
      EC261/UK261, US DOT refund entitlements, airline amenity policies,
      Montreal Convention for baggage-related expenses, and contract of
      carriage.
    - >-
      Automated document/receipt extraction (OCR + validation) and fraud checks
      (duplicate detection, anomaly scoring, synthetic identity screening).
    - >-
      Response drafting with LLMs using approved templates, multi-lingual (30+
      languages), with legal guardrails and human-in-the-loop review where
      confidence is low.
    - >-
      Payout orchestration: cash (SEPA/ACH/wire), real-time push-to-card (Visa
      Direct/Mastercard Send), vouchers/wallet credit, miles, and split
      payouts—chosen per policy and passenger preference.
    - >-
      Regulatory/policy update service: curated updates to rules packs (EU case
      law, UK deviations, DOT refund rules, airline policy changes) with test
      suites to validate before deployment.
    - >-
      Audit, reporting, and dispute handling: full decision trace, evidence pack
      generation, and regulator-ready logs; SLA dashboards.
    - >-
      Sandbox and A/B testing to tune policies for cost/NPS trade-offs and to
      simulate impact of rule changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Policy-as-code decisioning with explainable AI that classifies eligibility,
    drafts compliant responses in the passenger’s language, and triggers instant
    payouts/refunds—cutting claim handling cost by 50–70%, improving decision
    accuracy, and reducing regulatory exposure.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary evidence-linked attribution graph combining multi-source
    operational data with policy-as-code and explainable outcomes, enriched by
    network effects from anonymized decision outcomes across carriers; prebuilt
    integrations and regulator-reviewed templates shorten implementation and
    reduce legal risk—hard for new entrants to replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Airlines operating to/from/within EU/UK (EC261/UK261-covered), US
      carriers subject to DOT refund rules, and global carriers with US/EU
      operations (network, LCC, hybrid).
    - 'Secondary: Airline BPOs/GSAs handling claims on behalf of carriers.'
    - >-
      Tertiary: OTAs/Metasearch/Travel Management Companies seeking to triage
      and route claims/refunds; travel insurers for benefit coordination.
  channels:

      pilots (6–12 weeks).

      access.

      effective dates) with migration playbooks and checklists.
  revenueStreams:

      SaaS subscription tiered by annual passenger volume (base platform +
      support).
