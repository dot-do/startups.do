  problem:
    - >-
      Scouting is episodic and labor-limited: many growers and CCAs walk <10% of
      acres weekly during peak season, leading to late detection of stress and
      avoidable yield loss.
    - >-
      Yield-robbing issues (SDS, white mold, nutrient deficiencies, herbicide
      injury, drainage stress) can escalate in 5–10 days; manual detection often
      lags by 7–14 days.
    - >-
      Existing satellite dashboards show indices but don’t translate anomalies
      into precise, geo-tagged scouting tasks with severity, likely cause, and
      routes.
    - >-
      Cloud cover and inconsistent revisit schedules cause gaps; growers need
      reliable, near-daily signal and confidence scoring.
    - >-
      Retail agronomists manage 50k–300k acres; they need multi-farm
      prioritization, not field-by-field map browsing.
    - >-
      Data overload and false positives erode trust; teams need
      precision/recall, alert suppression, and learning feedback loops.
    - >-
      Integrations with equipment and farm platforms are fragmented, creating
      duplicate work and low adoption.
    - >-
      Growers demand quantifiable ROI per acre and proof that alerts lead to
      saved bushels or reduced passes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-sensor satellite monitoring (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-1
      SAR) with daily cloud-resilient composites and per-field baselines.
    - >-
      Phenology-aware anomaly detection using NDVI/EVI/NDWI/red-edge indices and
      weather-adjusted trend models tailored to soybean stages (V1–R7).
    - >-
      Geo-tagged scouting tasks with severity scores, likely cause suggestions,
      and in-field mobile navigation (offline maps).
    - >-
      Retail agronomist console to triage by risk across all customers,
      auto-generate route plans, and track task closures.
    - >-
      Disease and lodging risk layers (SDS, white mold, Frogeye Leaf Spot)
      combining microclimate and canopy signals; irrigation/drainage stress
      detection.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: users label findings; model recalibrates thresholds
      per field/hybrid/soil, reducing false positives over time.
    - >-
      Integrations: John Deere Ops Center, Climate FieldView, AgLeader SMS,
      Esri; export shapefiles/GeoJSON and prescription zones.
    - >-
      Actionable weekly summary reports and API/webhooks for enterprise
      workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect and prioritize soybean stress 7–10 days earlier than traditional
    scouting, convert it into geo-tagged tasks and optimized routes, and prove
    ROI in bushels saved—integrated with John Deere Operations Center and
    Climate FieldView.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Phenology-aware, soybean-specific anomaly and disease risk models trained on
    multi-year, multi-state ground truth with retailer partners, combined with
    geo-tagged task generation and routing tightly integrated into JD Ops
    Center/FieldView workflows—reducing noise and proving ROI in bushels saved.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Soybean growers and agronomists managing large acreages who want predictable
    yields and efficient scouting.
  problem: >-
    External: Pests, disease, and weather stress hide until they’re costly.
    Internal: Limited time and crews mean you can’t scout every acre weekly.
    Philosophical: Crop decisions should be proactive and data-driven, not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of missed stress in soybeans. Our AI continuously
    analyzes satellite indices (e.g., NDVI/NDRE, change detection) to spot
    anomalies early and deliver accurate, geo‑tagged scouting tasks and clear
    summaries.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload or sync field boundaries. 2) We monitor continuously and alert by
    zone when anomalies emerge. 3) Ground-truth with our mobile map, complete
    tasks, and act with confidence. Simple per‑acre pricing, no hardware, cancel
    anytime; your data stays yours.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot on your fields or book a 15‑minute demo. Upload boundaries
    today and receive your first alerts within 24–48 hours.
  success: >-
    Catch issues earlier, protect yield, reduce wasted scouting passes, time
    sprays precisely, document decisions, and finish the season with fewer
    surprises and higher profit per acre.
  failure: >-
    Without it: hidden stress spreads, late interventions, avoidable yield loss,
    extra trips and chemical costs, and another season of reactive firefighting.

  problem:
    - 'Stress and disease are found late, after yield is lost.'
    - Scouting wastes hours on healthy acres.
    - Images without context trigger false alarms.
    - Notes and photos are scattered and hard to act on.
    - Coordinating crews across fields is inefficient.
    - 'No simple, field-ready summaries for decisions.'
  solution:
    - Continuous satellite monitoring tuned for soybeans.
    - AI flags anomalies using stage-aware field baselines.
    - 'Instant alerts with severity, acres impacted, and trend.'
    - 'Auto-generated, geo-tagged scouting tasks and optimized routes.'
    - Offline mobile maps with notes and photo capture that sync.
    - 'Clear summaries for agronomy, insurance, and input planning.'
  features:
    - >-
      Soybean-specific signals: stand gaps, iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC),
      weed escapes, compaction, drought stress, disease hotspots (SDS, white
      mold, frogeye).
    - 'Indices tracked: NDVI, NDRE, EVI, and moisture/stress indicators.'
    - Cloud-aware composites keep maps usable after cloudy spells.
    - Anomaly heatmaps with acre counts and priority ranking.
    - Change detection vs last week and season-to-date normal.

  steps:
    - 'Add fields: draw or upload boundaries, set crop and planting date.'
    - 'Baseline: system learns each field’s normal by soybean growth stage.'
    - 'Monitor: each clear satellite pass updates maps and scores anomalies.'
    - 'Alert: receive notifications with map, acres, and suggested checks.'
    - 'Scout: follow geo-tagged routes; capture notes and photos offline.'
    - 'Decide: review summaries, trigger follow-up tasks, export reports.'
