leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers receive fragmented consignment leads across email, website forms,
      DMs, and marketplace inboxes; manual triage is slow and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Staff spend 5–15 minutes per inquiry to extract details, request missing
      info, check comps/provenance, and reply; most leads are low-quality.
    - >-
      Slow or no responses (24–72 hours) cause consignors to go elsewhere;
      response inconsistency hurts brand perception.
    - >-
      Basic CRM/automation tools aren’t tuned to art-specific checks (artist
      market depth, edition matching, fakes/fraud red flags, price range
      realism).
    - >-
      Dealers risk legal/reputation issues by missing stolen-art flags or
      mispricing; compliance checks are ad hoc.
    - >-
      Intake data is not structured; insights are lost for pricing, artist
      program fit, and forecasting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel ingestion: capture inbound from email, web forms,
      Artsy/Artnet inboxes, and Instagram DMs into a unified queue.
    - >-
      AI parsing and normalizing: extract artist, title, medium, dimensions,
      photos, provenance, condition, asking price, location, and urgency; fill
      structured fields in CRM.
    - >-
      Quick checks: stolen-art screening (Art Loss Register match), basic
      provenance sanity checks, edition/series logic, duplicate lead detection,
      and estimated shipping feasibility/cost bands.
    - >-
      Market scoring: artist liquidity, historical comps (Artprice/Artnet),
      condition/medium premium, demand fit for the dealer’s program; 0–100 lead
      score with rationale.
    - >-
      Auto-responses: polite, brand-aligned emails/messages that request missing
      info, decline gently, or escalate high-scorers to a specialist with
      calendar link.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: human-in-the-loop corrects scores/responses; model learns
      per-dealer preferences and improves over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reply to every consignment inquiry in under 2 minutes with a courteous,
    on-brand message after automated parsing, risk checks, market comps, and a
    quality score—so dealers focus only on the top 10–20% of leads and win
    better consignments faster.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cumulative, dealer-specific intake memory and cross-tenant fraud/risk
    signals; domain-tuned models and templates vetted by art-law experts;
    integrations embedded in dealers’ daily tools (Artlogic/Artsy), making
    switching costly and improving accuracy over time.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Mid-market galleries and secondary-market dealers (5–50
      employees) taking 30–300 inbound consignment leads/month.

      200–1,500 inbound lots/month.
    - >-
      Tertiary: Art advisors/brokers managing consignments across multiple
      sellers.
    - >-

      lead flow; galleries using Artlogic/Artbase/Art Galleria; auction houses
      with Mailchimp/HubSpot.
  channels:
    - >-
      Partnership integrations with gallery management systems (Artlogic, Art
      Galleria, Artbase) and listing marketplaces (Artsy partner apps).
    - >-
      Direct sales: targeted outbound to galleries/dealers on Artsy/Artnet;
      sequences to owners, registrars, and sales directors.

      report on dealer response times, and templates for polite declines.

      sessions for dealer associations (ADAA, CINOA, BADA).

      demos; sponsor dealer breakfasts.
