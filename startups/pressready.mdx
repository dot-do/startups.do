  inputs:
    - PDF/AI/EPS files
    - Finishing specs (trim/bleed/marks)
    - Target PDF/X standard
    - ICC profiles/press profile
  steps:
    - Ingest and version original files
    - >-
      Run rules‑based preflight (bleed, trim, fonts, transparency, overprint,
      image res)
    - >-
      Propose auto‑fixes; apply selected fixes (add bleed from content, embed
      fonts, flatten transparencies, convert spots if required)
    - Normalize to PDF/X (X‑1a or X‑4)
    - Generate soft proof PNGs and annotated issue report
    - Deliver fixed files and push status to MIS

    - Ghostscript
    - LittleCMS/ICC
    - Python
    - Optional LLM for human‑readable explanations
  outputs:

    - MIS/ERP credentials (optional)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High prepress labor: 5–15 minutes manual preflight/fixing per job;
      200–2,000 jobs/month/shop equals 17–500 hours/month of skilled operator
      time
    - >-
      Inconsistent PDF/X compliance (X-1a, X-4) causes late-stage RIP errors,
      rework, and missed SLAs
    - >-
      Frequent customer-supplied issues: missing bleed, low-res or RGB images,
      unembedded/substituted fonts, incorrect page size/trim boxes,
      overprint/knockout errors, spot-to-process mismatches
    - >-
      Current tools are rules-based and require expert setup; SMEs lack in-house
      color/prepress expertise to maintain profiles and rules
    - >-
      Poor client communication: preflight reports are technical and not
      customer-friendly, causing iteration delays
    - >-
      High reprint costs (typical $50–$500/job) from undetected issues and poor
      proofs; defect rates 0.5–2%
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows across web-to-print, MIS, RIP/DFE; no simple API to
      automate intake-to-press-ready handoff
    - >-
      Security/compliance concerns with cloud mean many shops avoid SaaS tools
      lacking on-prem or private processing options
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted preflight engine combining print rulesets (GWG/PDF/X) with ML
      to classify and auto-fix common issues
    - >-
      Auto-conversion to PDF/X-1a or PDF/X-4 with correct trim/bleed boxes,
      output intents, and transparency handling
    - >-
      Computer-vision bleed synthesis and AI super-resolution for marginal
      images; font embedding/substitution guidance
    - >-
      Color management automation: ICC assignment, RGB/spot-to-CMYK mapping by
      press/substrate; house-rule learning per device/profile
    - >-
      Human-friendly reports (PDF + web) explaining issues, severity, and fixes
      with before/after thumbnails; client-safe mode
    - >-
      API/CLI and workflow connectors to web-to-print, MIS, and RIP/DFEs for
      fully automated intake-to-press-ready pipelines
    - >-
      On-prem/edge runner and private cloud processing for secure environments;
      audit logs for compliance
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, AI-assisted preflight and one-click fixes that convert any
    supplied artwork into certified PDF/X press‑ready files, with plain-language
    client reports—cutting prepress time by 60–80% and reprints by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset from many print shops that trains house-rule
    recommendations and AI fixes (bleed synthesis, image upscaling) plus
    certified GWG/PDF/X compliance and turnkey connectors—reducing setup
    complexity versus incumbent rule-only tools.
