  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers rely on spreadsheets/ERP exports, spending 3–6 hours/day
      manually sequencing jobs and reworking plans after disruptions.
    - >-
      Rush orders and unplanned downtime cause frequent resequencing; plants
      incur 2–5% of sales in expedite/overtime costs to preserve customer
      service.
    - >-
      Current tools model infinite capacity or lack key constraints
      (mandrel/diameter changeovers, adhesive/cure times, oven capacity, tooling
      availability, crew skills), leading to unrealistic schedules and missed
      promise dates.
    - >-
      High changeover and setup losses (10–25% of available time) from
      suboptimal sequencing (diameter/grade/adhesive changes).
    - >-
      Promise-date quoting is imprecise without finite capacity
      capable-to-promise (CTP); on-time delivery often stuck at 88–94%.
    - >-
      Limited visibility to multi-plant capacity, tooling conflicts, and QC
      release gates; load balancing and dispatching are manual and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling engine tuned for paperboard container processes
      (MILP/CP-SAT with domain heuristics) covering winding/forming, laminating,
      curing/ovens, printing, cutting, assembly, QC release, and shipping.
    - >-
      Rush-order what-if simulator: insert a hot job and see impact to OTD,
      changeovers, overtime, and WIP in under 60 seconds for a 5–10 day horizon.
    - >-
      Real-time dispatch board: prioritized task lists for each line/crew with
      freeze windows, lock/unlock rules, and operator tablets; automatic
      re-dispatch on downtime or QC holds.
    - >-
      CTP/ATP module: promise-date quoting against finite capacity, tooling, and
      crew constraints, surfaced in ERP order-entry.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors for Epicor, Infor, Microsoft Dynamics 365/Business
      Central, SAP Business One, Plex, and common MES/PLC signals (OPC UA/MQTT).
    - >-
      Sequencing intelligence: changeover matrices (diameter/mandrel, adhesive
      family, liner/grade), cure-time gating, batch/campaign planning,
      trim/waste-aware slitting optimization.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit: OTD, schedule adherence, changeover hours, run-rate accuracy,
      expedite/overtime costs, lead time, WIP turns; daily/weekly variance
      explanations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Drop-in, domain-specific APS and dispatcher that models real paperboard
    container constraints. Achieve 98%+ OTD, 15–25% fewer changeover hours,
    10–20% shorter lead times, and 50% less planner effort—validated in a 6–8
    week pilot with ROI in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A ready-to-use constraint library and connectors tailored to NAICS 322219
    that deliver a feasible, high-quality schedule within two weeks, plus a data
    network effect that continuously improves run-rate estimates and changeover
    matrices across anonymized peers. The hybrid solver guarantees sub-minute
    rush what-ifs for typical horizons—enabling true dispatcher workflows
    competitors struggle to match.
