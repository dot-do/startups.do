  problem:
    - >-
      Recurring surface hotspots (taxiway conflicts, hold-short confusion,
      runway incursions precursors, ramp gridlock) go undetected as patterns;
      issues are discovered only after incidents or delays.
    - >-
      Existing A-SMGCS safety nets are reactive (alarm on infringement),
      proprietary, and tuned per-airport; they lack cross-airport benchmarking
      and post-ops trend discovery.
    - >-
      Data silos: surface tracks (ASDE-X/ASSC/A-SMGCS), NOTAMs/closures, SMGCS
      charts, construction phases, and weather are not fused into a single risk
      picture.
    - >-
      Controller and airport SMS teams face staffing constraints; manual hotspot
      reviews are time-consuming and inconsistent across shifts.
    - >-
      ANSPs and airports want low-risk innovation pathways; any live tooling
      must start in a non-operational ‘sandbox’ before consideration for
      operational use.
    - >-
      Scale of the problem: in the U.S. there are roughly 1,500–2,000 runway
      incursions per year with 10–30 serious events; taxi delays and pushback
      conflicts contribute measurable costs (tens of dollars per
      aircraft-minute) and throughput loss at major hubs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Post-ops analytics: ingest historical surface tracks (e.g.,
      STDDS/ASDE-X/ASSC/A-SMGCS), fuse with NOTAMs/closures, SMGCS routes, and
      weather to generate daily hotspot heatmaps, ranked risk lists, and monthly
      trend reports.
    - >-
      Live advisory (sandbox): stream low-latency surface tracks; detect and
      predict short-horizon (15–90s) conflict zones (converging taxi routes,
      blocked intersections, hold-line overruns, runway crossings with elevated
      risk) and publish to non-operational feeds/APIs for evaluation.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop validation: controller/ops dashboards for rapid triage
      of alerts, false-positive tagging, and annotation of local procedures;
      feedback continuously improves models.
    - >-
      Scenario playback and root-cause: time-synced replay of events with
      multi-layer overlays to support SMS investigations and training.
    - >-
      What-if and construction-aware modes: predict risk shifts under
      closures/construction phases and altered taxi flows.
    - >-
      Integration-ready outputs: OGC map tiles, protobuf/JSON event feeds, and
      CSV extracts; plug-ins for integrators and airport ops platforms.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vendor-neutral ML analytics that mines ground tracks to expose recurring
    surface risk patterns and emerging hotspots, delivered as daily SMS-ready
    heatmaps and optional low-latency advisory feeds in a sandbox. Deployable in
    under 8 weeks using historical tracks; measurable detection quality targets,
    seamless integrator handoff, and a clear pathway from post-ops to live
    advisory without disrupting existing A-SMGCS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-airport, vendor-neutral dataset and labeling ontology for surface
    risk, enabling transferable models that detect emerging hotspots faster than
    per-airport rule tuning; low-latency streaming architecture proven in
    sandbox environments; deep integrator partnerships and prebuilt connectors
    to STDDS/A-SMGCS that reduce deployment time to weeks instead of months.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tower supervisors, surface ops managers, and ANSP safety analysts who need
    rapid, reliable visibility into ground‑movement risk.
  problem: >-
    Surface tracks hide recurring hotspots and potential conflict zones; current
    tools show incidents, not patterns. Time is scarce, clutter is risky, and
    leaders need objective evidence to brief controllers and refine procedures.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to prevent runway incursions and taxi conflicts.
    Our safety-first analytics turn ground tracks into clear,
    controller-friendly insights—validated in a sandbox and delivered without
    workflow disruption.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historical/live surface track feeds in a sandbox. 2) Receive
    daily hotspot heatmaps with concise narratives. 3) Optionally enable
    low‑latency advisories for situational awareness. 4) Review results, set
    thresholds, and choose rollout.
  callToAction: Book a 30‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot with your data.
  success: >-
    A continuous picture of surface risk, targeted procedural fixes, fewer taxi
    deviations and hold‑short errors, faster debriefs, measurable risk
    reduction, and higher controller confidence.
  failure: >-
    Hotspots stay invisible, conflicts recur, investigations multiply, delays
    grow, and preventable incidents threaten safety, capacity, and reputation.

      AI for ATC: daily surface-risk heatmaps plus optional low-latency sandbox
      advisories from ground tracks.
    ctaText: Start a pilot
    ctaHref: /contact?type=pilot
  problem:
    - >-
      Surface conflicts evolve with traffic mix, construction, and weather—hard
      to see with manual reviews.
    - >-
      Hotspot definitions drift; teams lack timely, objective evidence of where
      risk concentrates.
    - >-
      Raw track tools show where aircraft were, not where they repeatedly
      interact in risky ways.
    - >-
      Post-ops analysis is slow; insights arrive after procedures are already in
      use.
    - Trialing live alerts in operations is risky and hard to approve.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automatically detects recurring hotspot patterns and potential conflict
      zones from ground tracks.
    - >-
      Delivers daily, ranked heatmaps you can act on and compare by time, runway
      configuration, and weather.
    - >-
      Optional low-latency advisory feed highlights emerging hotspots in a safe
      sandbox for evaluation and training.
    - >-
      Simple API and dashboard integrate with ASDE-X/ASSC/ADS-B/MLAT data you
      already have.
    - >-
      Quantifies impact of changes so safety teams can prioritize mitigations
      and measure results.
  features:
    - >-
      Data in: ASDE-X/ASSC, ADS-B/MLAT, surface radar tracks; optional NOTAMs,
      METAR/ATIS, runway configuration logs.
    - >-
      Hotspot modeling: density clustering and interaction scoring on taxiways,
      runway crossings, pushback zones, and hold-short lines.
    - >-
      Daily outputs: heatmaps, ranked hotspot list, trend deltas, context
      trajectories, and exportable GeoJSON/PNG.
    - >-
      Live sandbox advisory: sub-10s latency from ingest, severity tiers,
      filters by area and time, WebSocket/MQTT stream or WMS tiles.
    - >-
      Change detection: before/after comparisons for construction phases,
      routing tweaks, and procedure updates.
    - >-
      Integration: dashboard, REST API, S3/HTTPS delivery, SIEM-friendly logs,
      RBAC and SSO support.
    - >-
      Deployment: cloud VPC or on-prem appliance; read-only data pull; no new
      sensors required.
    - >-
      Governance: data minimization, retention controls, audit trails; advisory
      feed is non-operational by default.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect your surface track feed and metadata (ASDE-X/ASSC or ADS-B/MLAT,
      METAR, runway configuration).
    - Backfill 30–90 days of history; calibrate models with your SME review.

    - >-
      Integrate exports into your SMS and briefing workflows; set success
      metrics.
    - Review pilot outcomes and plan operationalization if desired.
