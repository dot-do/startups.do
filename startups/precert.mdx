  title: Regulatory Pre‑Compliance Plan & Artifact Generator (FCC/CE/RED)
  description: >-
    AI agent maps product specs to applicable regulations and generates a
    pre‑compliance test plan, labeling, user‑manual statements, DoC drafts, and
    KDB/ETSI reference lists.
  targetUsers:
    - Regulatory engineers
    - NPI program managers
    - Hardware/RF leads
  triggers:
    - New SKU entering NPI
    - Major RF change (frequency/power change)
    - Entering new market (EU/UK/CA/AU)
  inputs:
    - 'Product datasheet and RF parameters (freq, power, modulation, bandwidth)'
    - 'Block diagram and antenna info (gain, type, location)'
    - Enclosure photos/CAD
    - Intended regions/markets
    - Power/charging details
  steps:
    - >-
      Parse inputs and classify product under RED/FCC Part(s) and safety/EMC
      scopes
    - >-
      Map to specific clauses (e.g., FCC Part 15.247/407, ETSI EN 300 328/301
      489, EN 62368-1)
    - >-
      Draft pre‑compliance test plan (radiated/conducted, harmonics, spurious,
      SAR if applicable)
    - Generate labeling/marking requirements and DoC/Cover letters templates
    - >-
      Produce user‑manual regulatory statements (SAR exposure,
      channel/frequency, local restrictions)
    - Compile KDB/ETSI guidance citations and lab checklist
  tools:
    - FCC OET KDB and Equipment Authorization database
    - EU RED guidance notes
    - Python + rule engine
    - Doc generation (Pandoc/LaTeX)
  outputs:
    - Pre‑compliance test plan (PDF)
    - Labeling artwork specs and placement guide (PDF)
    - Draft DoC and cover letters (DOCX)
    - Manual regulatory language pack (per region)
    - Traceability list of standards/clauses
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per‑SKU fee (e.g., $1,500–$4,000)'
    - 'Add‑on: subscription for standards updates ($200/mo)'
    - Optional human legal review hourly
  humanInLoop: true

    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 7
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Misinterpretation of borderline classifications
    - Standards updates moving target
    - Region‑specific nuances (NB engagement)
  dependencies:
    - Access to specs/CAD/photos
    - Market list
    - Company labeling brand guidelines

  problem:
    - >-
      Manufacturers waste 4–10 weeks mapping product specifications to
      applicable FCC/CE/RED requirements, often duplicating work across regions.
    - >-
      Late regulatory discoveries (e.g., DFS, MPE/SAR, RED Article 10 packaging)
      trigger design changes and lab re-tests costing $10k–$50k and delaying
      launch by 1–2 months.
    - >-
      Labeling, user manual, and DoC mistakes are among the top causes of
      certification delays and NB questions.
    - >-
      Keeping up with FCC KDB/ETSI updates and harmonized standard transitions
      (e.g., EN 300 328 v2.x.x to v3.x.x) is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      SMBs lack in-house compliance experts; consultants are expensive
      ($200–$350/hour) and availability is limited near deadlines.
    - >-
      Test plans are inconsistent and not traceable to clause-level
      requirements, leading to change orders and scope creep at labs.
    - >-
      No single source of truth links product radio parameters, country
      variants, and compliance artifacts; knowledge lives in spreadsheets and
      emails.
  solution:
    - >-
      Structured intake of product specs (radios, frequencies, power,
      modulation, antenna, enclosure, power supply, market countries) via guided
      forms and BOM import.
    - >-
      AI-driven mapping engine aligns specs to FCC Parts (e.g., 15C/E,
      22/24/27), KDBs, and ETSI EN/ETR standards under RED with clause-level
      citations.
    - >-
      Automated, lab-ready pre‑compliance test plan generation (configuration
      matrix, modes, worst-case settings, sample quantities, photos list).
    - >-
      Auto-generation of labeling artwork, packaging marks (FCC ID, CE/UKCA,
      WEEE), user manual statements, and language requirements per market.
    - >-
      Draft Declaration of Conformity and Technical Documentation table of
      contents, including essential requirements mapping and traceability
      matrix.
    - >-
      KDB/ETSI reference list with direct clause citations, latest versions,
      transition dates, and impact analysis.
    - >-
      Module integration guidance (host responsibilities, permissive change
      paths, antenna substitutions, co-location/MPE/SAR evaluation).
    - >-
      Change impact analyzer: highlights effect of spec changes (e.g., antenna
      gain increase, new band) on requirements and artifacts.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring of standard updates; alerts and one-click artifact
      refresh with redlines.
    - >-
      Export to lab packages (Word/PDF/CSV) and integrations with PLM (Arena),
      CAD (Altium 365), and ticketing (Jira).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI copilot that converts your RF/module specs into an audit-ready
    pre‑compliance package (test plan, labeling, user manual statements, DoC
    draft, clause citations) in under 60 minutes—reducing lab change orders by
    25–40% and time-to-test by 2–4 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, clause-level knowledge graph with human-reviewed mappings and
    real lab feedback, plus distribution through test labs and module vendors.
    Backed by a re‑test credit guarantee (up to $3,000/SKU) when our artifacts

  character: >-
    Hardware and compliance leads at Other Communications Equipment
    manufacturers (NAICS 334290) shipping RF-enabled products to US/EU who want
    first-pass compliance without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: fragmented FCC/CE/RED rules, shifting KDB/ETSI refs, and
    lab-specific requirements. Internal: uncertainty about what applies and fear
    of costly retests. Philosophical: engineers should build products—not
    decipher regulations.
  guide: >-
    We understand lab-day failures and launch slips. Our AI is trained on FCC
    Parts and KDBs, ETSI EN standards, and common test-house workflows; our team
    has guided many radio SKUs from concept to market.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload product specs (bands, radios, power, interfaces, antennas,
    enclosure, markets). 2) AI maps applicability and generates a pre-compliance
    test plan, labeling, user-manual statements, DoC drafts, and KDB/ETSI
    reference lists. 3) Review, customize, export to your lab or QMS. Data stays
    private; standard updates tracked; not legal advice.

    Direct: Start a free pre-check and generate a draft plan in minutes.
    Transitional: Download a sample mapping report or book a 15-minute scoping
    call.
  success: >-
    Confident lab entry, fewer retests, aligned lab quotes, correct labeling and
    DoC, faster market access, and audit-ready documentation for customers and
    investors.
  failure: >-
    Weekslong delays, failed lab days, emergency redesigns, stop-ship notices,
    fines, and missed launch windows.
