  problem:
    - >-
      Excessive NC drill/router tool counts increase tool-change overhead (2–6
      seconds/change) and idle time, stretching cycle time by 10–30%.
    - >-
      Manual tool-table consolidation in CAM is slow (15–45 min/job),
      error-prone, and varies by engineer, leading to inconsistent results and
      rework.
    - >-
      Fear of violating finished-hole tolerances and breakout constraints
      prevents aggressive optimization; scrap events are costly and damage
      delivery performance.
    - >-
      Machine-specific nuances (magazine limits, spindle acceleration, peck
      cycles, feed/speed tables) are underutilized in current CAM flows, leaving
      capacity on the table.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ODB++/Gerber/Excellon from customers, machine logs, SPC)
      prevents closed-loop optimization and proof of conformance.
    - >-
      Existing CAM tools offer basic mapping but lack automated, tolerance-aware
      clustering and route/path optimization tuned to each machine and stack-up.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest ODB++/Gerber/Excellon/Sieb&Meyer, derive hole classes
      (plated/unplated, via types), and compute finished-hole tolerances from
      design notes and IPC defaults.
    - >-
      Tolerance-aware tool clustering: reassign near-diameter tools within
      allowed finished-hole tolerance and plating allowance; honor annular ring
      and minimum land rules.
    - >-
      Machine-aware cycle-time model: simulates tool changes, traverses, spindle
      accel, peck cycles, and feed/speed tables per machine to choose optimal
      tool set and path order.
    - >-
      Routing optimizer: reorders routes (panel and board level) to minimize
      non-cutting moves; manages tabs, lead-in/out, and breakout constraints.
    - >-
      Magazine-aware planning: respects maximum tools per program, prioritizes
      common tools across jobs, and suggests global rack rationalization.
    - >-
      Formal verification: proves that each reassigned tool meets finished-hole
      size, positional tolerances, and breakout constraints; generates an audit
      report for QA.
    - >-
      Safe outputs: writes optimized NC programs (Excellon/Drill/Rout) and a
      diff report; provides single-click rollback and A/B run labels.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingests machine logs and SPC (hole size Cpk,
      breakouts) to refine models and shop-specific constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Guaranteed tolerance-safe AI that consolidates NC drill/route tool tables
    and reorders paths to cut tool changes and cycle time 10–25% per
    job—validated per machine with an auditable report and one-click rollback.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Machine-calibrated digital twin and tolerance-verification engine trained on
    diverse, real-world NC datasets—delivering provable, audit-ready
    optimizations that are vendor-agnostic, safe by design, and continuously
    improved from SPC feedback.

  character: >-
    Bare PCB fabrication CAM/NC engineers and manufacturing leaders who need to
    hit throughput and quality targets.
  problem: >-
    Bloated NC drill/route programs create too many tools, long cycle times, and
    tedious manual cleanup—keeping teams under deadline pressure while fearing
    tolerance violations.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pain of tool bloat and reruns. Our purpose-built AI for
    bare-board NC drill/route tool table rationalization simplifies programs
    while honoring tolerances, stack-ups, and customer specs.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload NC drill/rout files, stack-up, and allowed tolerances. 2) AI
    cleans, consolidates, and simulates to produce a tolerance-safe tool table
    and revised programs with a clear diff report. 3) You review, approve, and
    deploy—optionally piloting on a single panel first.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a low-risk pilot on one live job or request a sample optimization
    report.
  success: >-
    Fewer tools and faster cycles, fewer operator touches, improved OEE,
    predictable on-time delivery, and consistent quality—without violating
    tolerances.
  failure: >-
    Sticking with bloated programs means wasted spindle time, frequent tool
    changes, higher consumable costs, missed deadlines, and scrap risk from
    tolerance errors.
