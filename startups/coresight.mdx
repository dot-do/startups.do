  problem:
    - >-
      Manual core logging is slow (2–6 minutes/m) and inconsistent across
      geologists and shifts, delaying decisions on drilling, geotech design, and
      metallurgical test work.
    - >-
      RQD and fracture logging from tray photos is error-prone; distinguishing
      natural vs mechanical breaks and consistent stick length measurement is
      difficult without standardized image processing.
    - >-
      Fracture orientation is underutilized because calculating alpha/beta from
      oriented core marks is tedious and requires specialized tools and
      training.
    - >-
      Lithology intervals logged from photos alone lack repeatability;
      integrating pXRF, hyperspectral, and historic logs is rare due to siloed
      systems.
    - >-
      Existing core photo systems store images but do not extract structured
      geotech and lithology attributes at scale, creating a data bottleneck.
    - >-
      Remote sites have poor bandwidth; cloud-only solutions cannot process
      images in near-real time at rigs or core sheds.
    - >-
      Integration friction with acQuire, MX Deposit, Seequent, Datamine, and
      Micromine leads to duplicated entry, delayed QA/QC, and schema mismatches.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision pipeline that detects core sticks, tray geometry, and
      scale objects, converts pixels to millimeters, segments natural vs
      mechanical breaks, and computes RQD to ISRM A/B/C standards.
    - >-
      Fracture detection and density calculation with confidence scoring;
      optional calculation of orientation (alpha/beta) from visible orientation
      marks and reference lines on oriented core.
    - >-
      Lithology interval suggestions using texture, color, veining, alteration
      features; optional fusion with pXRF/hyperspectral metadata to raise
      confidence and propose interval boundaries.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI: geologists accept/edit AI suggestions; system
      learns from corrections via active learning; per-tray QA heatmaps and
      audit logs.
    - >-
      Edge/on-prem processing appliance for low-bandwidth sites with nightly
      sync to cloud and offline cache; typical throughput 20–30 trays/hour
      on-site.
    - >-
      Connectors to acQuire GIM Suite, MX Deposit, Seequent Central/Imago,
      Datamine Fusion, Micromine Geobank; schema mapping and validation rules to
      prevent bad loads.
    - >-
      Automated QC and compliance: versioned models, acceptance thresholds,
      exception routing, and change history for investor and regulatory audits.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, audited RQD, fracture metrics, and lithology suggestions from core
    tray photos in minutes, integrated directly into your logging
    database—cutting logging time by 40–60% while improving consistency and
    decision speed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-commodity labeled dataset and feedback loop from multiple
    majors enables models that generalize across geologies; validated QA/QC
    workflows produce audit-grade outputs trusted by regulators and investors;
    and an edge-first architecture delivers near-real-time results at remote
    sites without reliable internet.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Exploration and mine geology teams in other metal ore mining who need fast,
    consistent core logging to keep drilling, modeling, and investment decisions
    on track.
  problem: >-
    Manual photo-based core logging is slow and subjective, creating backlogs
    that delay decisions and undermine QA/QC. Teams feel pressure to deliver
    defensible, auditable logs with fewer people. Logging should be objective,
    repeatable, and immediate.
  guide: >-
    We understand the realities of wet trays, variable lighting, and tight
    turnarounds. Core Image Auto-Logging is built with geologists, benchmarked
    against labeled datasets, and integrates cleanly with your existing logging
    systems and governance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your image source or upload historical tray photos. 2) AI
    extracts RQD, fracture density/orientation, and suggests lithology
    intervals; you review exceptions. 3) Approve and sync to your logging
    database via API/CSV with QC rules and dashboards.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo and run a pilot on your own tray images to receive
    results, accuracy metrics, and an integration plan.
  success: >-
    Turn hours of logging into minutes, with consistent, auditable metrics.
    Enable earlier drilling, sampling, and modeling decisions, reduce cost per
    meter, and improve safety by reducing handling time.
  failure: >-
    Continue facing backlogs, inconsistent logs, and rework—leading to delayed
    decisions, higher costs, and missed structural insights.
