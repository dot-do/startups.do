  title: RFQ-to-Quote Automation for Metal/Composite Office Furniture
  description: >-
    AI agent reads RFQs, drawings, and BOMs to produce priced quotes, lead
    times, and CRM entries with traceable cost build-up.
  targetUsers:
    - Estimating
    - Sales Ops
    - Dealers (internal portals)
  triggers:
    - New RFQ email with attachments
    - Portal upload of RFQ ZIP
    - CRM deal moved to ‘Estimating’
  inputs:
    - RFQ PDFs/CSVs
    - Drawings (STEP/DXF/DWG)
    - Material price tables (steel/aluminum/plastics/foam)
    - Labor/machine rates and routing library
    - Overhead/margin rules
    - Historical win/loss data
  steps:
    - OCR and classify RFQ docs; extract line items/specs
    - 'Parse drawings to identify materials, gauges, features (bends, holes)'
    - >-
      Estimate material usage and cycle times by process (laser/punch, press
      brake, welding, powder coat, assembly)
    - >-
      Apply scrap, setup, and batch factors; compute cost and recommended
      price/margin
    - Suggest lead time from capacity model and supplier lead times
    - >-
      Generate formatted quote PDF and push to CRM/ERP; flag low-confidence
      items for review
  tools:
    - AWS Textract or Google Document AI
    - OpenAI/Claude LLM for structured extraction
    - Autodesk Forge or FreeCAD Python for geometry parsing
    - Custom cost model + pandas
    - Salesforce/HubSpot/PandaDoc APIs
  outputs:
    - Itemized quote PDF/Doc
    - Cost breakdown (materials/labor/overhead)
    - Lead-time estimate
    - CRM/ERP quote record with BOM and routing
  pricingModel:
    - 'Per RFQ (e.g., $100–$500)'
    - Volume tier or monthly subscription with usage

    modelCapability: 8.5
    overall: 9
  risks:
    - Extraction errors causing misquotes
    - Unmodeled features in drawings
    - Out-of-date cost tables
    - Liability for pricing accuracy
  dependencies:
    - Access to cost tables and routing data
    - CRM/ERP API credentials
    - Material price feeds or manual updates
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive with mixed formats (email text, PDFs, STEP/DXF, spreadsheets)
      causing 1–3 days average cycle time per quote and high manual effort by
      sales engineers.
    - >-
      Estimators struggle to consistently interpret drawings/BOMs and apply
      routing/operations (laser, punch, bend, weld, powder coat, assembly),
      creating quote variability and margin leakage (2–5 pts).
    - >-
      Lead times are often guessed rather than capacity-driven, leading to
      missed delivery promises and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Historical quote and job cost data are fragmented across ERP, shared
      drives, and spreadsheets, limiting learning from win/loss and actual cost
      variance.
    - >-
      High RFQ volume spikes (e.g., contract bids) force triage; many ‘no-hope’
      RFQs still consume hours, while profitable ones may be delayed or missed.
    - >-
      CRM updates (contacts, opportunities, activities) are inconsistent,
      hurting pipeline visibility and dealer/OEM satisfaction.
    - >-
      Price volatility in steel/aluminum, hardware, and freight isn’t reflected
      quickly in quotes, eroding margins or competitiveness.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ Inbox: Parse emails and attachments; classify RFQ type; extract due
      dates, delivery terms, compliance, and line items.
    - >-
      Drawing/BOM intelligence: Extract geometry/features from PDFs/STEP/DXF;
      identify materials, gauges, bends, weld lengths, hardware; reconcile to
      BOMs.
    - >-
      Cost engine tuned for office furniture: Auto-generate routings for
      laser/punch, bending, welding, grinding, powder coating, assembly; include
      hardware and purchased parts; drive machine/labor times from templates
      refined by historicals.
    - >-
      Lead-time estimator: Capacity model by cell/machine; checks calendars,
      WIP, and supplier lead times to propose realistic promise dates and
      expedite options with cost impacts.
    - >-
      Price governance: Margin targets by customer/segment; dynamic
      material/hardware/freight price feeds; discounting rules;
      customer-specific pricing; approval workflows.
    - >-
      Traceable breakdowns: Shareable cost rollups (material, machine time,
      labor, overhead, paint, hardware, freight) with assumptions; version
      control and audit trail.
    - >-
      CRM/ERP sync: Auto-create opportunities, quotes, and contacts in
      Salesforce/HubSpot; push winning quotes to ERP (Epicor/Infor/Microsoft) as
      jobs/estimates.
    - >-
      Learning loop: Compare quotes to actuals; auto-calibrate times and scrap
      factors; track win/loss drivers and price sensitivity.
    - >-
      Compliance and security: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO, per-project NDA handling,
      role-based access; on-premises and private cloud options for sensitive
      data.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs, drawings, and BOMs into priced, capacity-aware, and CRM-synced
    quotes in minutes—with traceable cost build-up specific to office furniture
    fabrication.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category depth in office furniture fabrication—prebuilt routings, hardware
    catalogs, and capacity models—combined with a closed-loop learning system
    tied to actuals and CRM outcomes, plus a growing anonymized benchmark
    dataset that improves quote accuracy and lead-time promises without exposing
    customer IP.

    Estimating and operations leaders at metal/composite office furniture
    manufacturers who need to turn RFQs with drawings/BOMs into accurate, priced
    quotes fast without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: Flood of RFQs, complex drawings/BOMs, manual spreadsheets, slow
    CRM entry. Internal: Stress from bottlenecks, fear of errors and missed
    deadlines. Philosophical: Quoting should be as engineered and traceable as
    production.
  guide: >-
    We understand quoting bottlenecks—manufacturing and AI specialists who’ve
    lived the process. Industry-tuned models for metal/composite office
    furniture, integrated with email/CAD/PLM/ERP-CRM, secure and auditable.
    Human-in-the-loop by default.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect templates, price lists, routings, and CAD/BOM sources. 2) Ingest
    RFQs via email/portal; AI extracts requirements, builds
    routing/materials/costs, proposes lead time. 3) Review, adjust, approve;
    auto-generate quote PDF and CRM/ERP entries with full traceability.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 2-week pilot with your RFQs.
    Transitional: Get the ROI calculator and sample quote pack.
  success: >-
    Quotes in hours, not days; consistent pricing and lead times; higher win
    rates and protected margins; freed estimator capacity; clean CRM pipeline;
    audit-ready cost build-up buyers trust.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting: late or inaccurate quotes, missed RFQs, margin
    leakage, duplicated data entry, reliance on tribal knowledge—while faster
    competitors win the work.
