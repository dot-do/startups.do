leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Turnaround milestones (deboarding, fueling, cleaning, baggage, catering,
      crew/boarding, pushback) frequently slip due to fragmented situational
      awareness across airlines, ground handlers, and airport ops, causing
      D0/D15 misses and cascading delays.
    - >-
      Current tools are retrospective dashboards or manual radio coordination;
      they lack predictive warnings (30–60+ minutes out) and prescriptive
      recovery actions tailored to local SOPs and resource constraints.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (AODB, DCS, GSE telematics, ACARS/ADS-B, deicing, weather).
      Without a fused view, coordinators cannot proactively re-sequence tasks or
      reallocate scarce resources.
    - >-
      Operational complexity (irregular ops, deicing, late inbound, gate
      changes) overwhelms dispatchers; consistent, cross-stakeholder nudging is
      missing, leading to avoidable 5–20 minute delays per turn.
    - >-
      Airports and ground handlers face tight SLAs and labor constraints;
      training and turnover create variability that increases milestone variance
      and safety risk on the ramp.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion layer integrates AODB/AIDX flight events, DCS/gate data,
      ADS-B/ACARS, GSE telematics, deicing systems, and weather into a single
      real-time turn timeline.
    - >-
      ML models forecast milestone start/finish times and slippage probability;
      scenario engine simulates what-if actions (e.g., swap belt loader,
      prioritize fueling, re-sequence boarding).
    - >-
      Prescriptive nudges route to responsible roles (mobile, radio-integrated,
      Teams/Slack, web) with clear actions and time-by-which, plus one-tap
      acknowledgement or deferral.
    - >-
      Recovery playbooks encode local SOPs, SLAs, union rules, and station
      realities (assets, staffing), ensuring recommendations are executable and
      compliant.
    - >-
      Command board for coordinators shows risk-ranked turns, resource
      conflicts, deicing queues, and stand/gate constraints with automated
      suggestions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning captures outcomes of nudges (accepted, executed,
      effect) to continuously improve model precision and playbooks.
    - >-
      Irregular ops/deicing mode predicts TSAT/CTOT impacts, queues trucks/pads,
      and recommends pre-treatment or sequence changes under weather
      constraints.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict, prevent, and recover from turnaround slips. TMO fuses live
    airport/airline/ground data to forecast milestone risks 30–90 minutes ahead
    and nudges the right stakeholder with concrete, playbook-based recovery
    actions—improving D0 by 3–5 points and reducing turn variance 10–20% within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, role-specific nudging engine tied to measurable outcomes (not
    just dashboards), underpinned by a growing proprietary dataset of micro-turn
    events and intervention efficacy across airports—allowing station-specific
    transfer learning and faster time-to-value than generic AODB/CDM modules or
    vision-only tools. Deep behavioral playbooks aligned to local SOPs and union
    rules drive consistent adoption.

    Airport and ground operations leaders (NAICS 488119) who must deliver safe,
    on-time turnarounds across gates and vendors.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented comms and late surprises make milestones slip—fueling, bags,
    boarding—triggering rolling delays, overtime, and missed D0/OTP. Delays
    shouldn’t be surprises.
  guide: >-
    Turnaround Milestone Orchestrator understands ramp chaos and frontline
    pressure. Our AI predicts milestone slippage early and issues role-specific,
    concrete recovery actions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect AODB/A-CDM, flight and resource feeds. 2) Set milestone SLAs and
    nudge rules. 3) Go live, act on action cards, review KPIs.
  callToAction: 'Book a 30-minute demo and start a low-risk, single-gate pilot.'
  success: >-
    Calm, predictable turns; higher OTP and utilization; safer ramps; fewer
    radio calls; clear accountability and continuous improvement.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting: rolling delays, misconnects, equipment conflicts,
    higher costs, and exhausted teams.

      AI that predicts slippage and orchestrates on-time turnarounds across
      ramp, gate, fueling, cleaning, and catering.
    ctaText: Book a 30‑minute demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Turnarounds slip without early warning.
    - Fragmented comms start critical tasks late.
    - Siloed systems—no single source of truth for the turn.
    - Manual dispatching wastes minutes and manpower.
    - Duty managers firefight instead of orchestrate.
    - OTP penalties and missed slot costs stack up.
    - Weak accountability and unclear ownership of delays.
    - 'Recovery is improvised, not playbook-driven.'
  solution:
    - Always-on monitoring of each flight’s milestone graph.
    - AI risk scores forecast slippage 15–60 minutes ahead.
    - Role-specific nudges with concrete recovery actions.
    - One-tap acknowledge and automatic reassignments.
    - Closed-loop updates sync to AODB/CDM and ops systems.
    - Playbooks convert disruption into standard work.
    - Real-time visibility for AOCC and station control.
    - 'Measure and improve OTP, block-off, and SLA performance.'
  features:
    - A-CDM–aligned milestones configurable by station.

  steps:
    - Connect data sources and define your milestone taxonomy.
    - Import historical turns and calibrate predictions.
    - 'Configure roles, SLAs, and recovery playbooks per station.'
    - Run a shadow pilot to tune thresholds and nudges.
