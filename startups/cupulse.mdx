leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on bearings, gearboxes, motors, pumps and presses
      causes 2–6% OEE loss; a single rolling/extrusion line can lose $10k–$40k
      per hour of downtime depending on product mix.
    - >-
      Early-stage faults (bearing inner/outer race defects, misalignment, gear
      mesh wear, lubrication breakdown, pump cavitation, rotor bar issues) are
      often missed by monthly route-based vibration rounds.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across SCADA/PLC, historians (e.g., PI), and CMMS (SAP
      PM/Maximo) makes it hard to connect condition data to work orders and
      parts availability.
    - >-
      Maintenance windows are tight (changeovers, annealing, press tooling), so
      interventions must be precisely scheduled to avoid production loss.
    - >-
      Limited onsite reliability bandwidth; analysts spend time triaging false
      alarms and manual trend analysis.
    - >-
      Long lead times for critical spares (weeks to months) create risk of
      extended outages when failures are detected late.
    - >-
      Harsh environments (heat, dust, oils) degrade sensors and complicate
      installation, leading to data gaps and unreliable monitoring.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy robust sensing (wired/wireless vibration, acoustic, temperature,
      motor current) on critical bearings, gearboxes, motors, pumps, presses,
      coilers, draw benches, annealers.
    - >-
      Edge gateway with OPC UA/Modbus/PROFINET to ingest PLC/SCADA and historian
      signals (speed, load, temperature, lubrication flow) and fuse with sensor
      streams.
    - >-
      Copper-specific AI models for rolling/extrusion duty cycles: bearing fault
      classification, gear mesh analytics, cavitation detection, misalignment,
      electrical faults; Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with confidence bounds.
    - >-
      Automated work order recommendations in CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo/Fiix/eMaint)
      with parts lists, estimated labor hours, and ideal intervention windows
      aligned to changeovers/anneals.
    - >-
      Production-aware scheduling: optimization that proposes the least-cost
      maintenance slot considering takt, WIP, annealing cycles, and crew
      availability.
    - >-
      Dashboards for reliability and operations: risk-ranked asset list, fault
      trajectory, lead time to failure, downtime avoided, financial impact.
    - >-
      12-week pilot playbook: instrument 20–40 critical assets on one line,
      baseline models in 4–6 weeks, demonstrate >2 early fault catches and >14
      days median lead time to failure detection.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime 20–40% and maintenance costs 10–20% in copper
    rolling/extrusion by predicting asset failures weeks in advance and
    auto-scheduling interventions within your production windows—integrated
    end-to-end with your historian and CMMS.
