  problem:
    - >-
      Passengers lack timely, accurate disruption information (weather,
      lock/bridge queues, mechanical issues), leading to confusion, crowding,
      and poor satisfaction.
    - >-
      Operators rely on manual monitoring (phone calls to lockmasters, radio,
      disparate apps), causing delayed decisions and inconsistent ETAs.
    - >-
      Crew spends significant time fielding “where is my boat?” inquiries,
      distracting from safe operations.
    - >-
      Refunds, chargebacks, and negative reviews rise during disruption spikes;
      operators lack tools to proactively manage expectations.
    - >-
      Existing AIS/weather tools aren’t tuned to inland passenger ops
      (locks/bridges/rivers), and generic mass-notification tools lack live ETA
      integration.
    - >-
      Regulators and authorities expect robust passenger communications during
      incidents; compliance is ad hoc and hard to audit.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and fuse real-time data: USACE lock status/lockage logs, USCG Local
      Notices to Mariners, DOT bridge opening schedules, NOAA/NWS hydrology and
      weather alerts, lightning, AIS/positioning, operator schedules, and
      optional engine/telemetry.
    - >-
      Predictive models estimate lock and bridge delays, weather-related
      slowdowns, and mechanical impact on schedule adherence; continuous ETA
      recalculation with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Autonomous passenger communications: condition-based triggers push
      SMS/WhatsApp/email/app/web updates (e.g., “Departing 12:10, ETA 12:32;
      bridge delay +7 min”).
    - >-
      Crew decision support: suggested departure holds, speed adjustments within
      safe limits, route alternates (where permitted), and pre-approved
      announcement scripts via mobile/radio PA integration.
    - >-
      Live disruption dashboard for ops centers and dock signage integration
      (QR-enabled web boards) with ADA-accessible, multilingual messaging.
    - >-
      Audit trail and compliance reporting: who was notified, when, with what
      content; exportable for internal QA and regulators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A 24/7 AI agent purpose-built for inland passenger waterways that predicts
    disruptions (lock/bridge queues, river weather, mechanical impacts),
    generates accurate ETAs, and automatically communicates clear, multilingual
    advisories to crew and passengers—reducing delays, support load, and refunds
    while improving safety and satisfaction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built inland disruption models (lock/bridge prediction) trained on
    fused authority data and operator telemetry, combined with deep ticketing
    integrations that enable targeted, automated passenger updates—difficult for
    generic AIS/weather or mass-notification vendors to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Inland water passenger operators—ferries, tours, and river cruises—who must
    keep schedules tight and passengers informed despite unpredictable river
    conditions.
  problem: >-
    Disruptions from weather, lock/bridge queues, and mechanical issues derail
    ETAs and flood crew/dispatch with calls; passengers feel kept in the dark,
    trust erodes, and small delays cascade into costly operations. People
    deserve timely, accurate updates and safe journeys.
  guide: >-
    We understand live river operations and the stress of uncertain ETAs. Our
    24/7 AI agent monitors weather, lock and bridge status, AIS/positioning, and
    asset health to detect disruptions early and compute trustworthy ETAs and
    advisories for crew and passengers.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: routes, schedules, vessel feeds, and status sources. 2) Set
    policies: notification rules, channels (SMS, PA, screens, web), and
    escalation. 3) Go live: the agent watches continuously and pushes updates
    automatically, with human override when needed.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a 30-day pilot on one route. Secondary: Schedule a 20-minute
    demo and route readiness check.
  success: >-
    Crew focus on safe operations while passengers get real-time ETAs and clear
    advisories on their preferred channels; fewer inbound calls, smoother
    turnarounds, better reviews, protected revenue on disrupted days, and a
    verified timeline for post-mortems and compliance.
  failure: >-
    Without it: silent delays, misinformation at docks, angry queues and
    refunds, stressed crews juggling calls, social backlash, and avoidable
    safety and compliance risks as small disruptions snowball.
