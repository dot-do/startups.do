  title: SKU Catalog Enrichment & Normalization
  description: >-
    Extracts attributes from supplier PDFs/images, normalizes to GS1/your
    schema, validates UPC/EANs, and generates sell sheets and web content.
  targetUsers:
    - Product Data/Catalog Manager
    - Sales Ops
    - Ecommerce Manager
  triggers:
    - New SKU onboarding
    - Supplier price list/catalog update
  inputs:
    - Supplier catalogs (PDF/Excel) and images
    - Existing item master
    - Attribute schema and value dictionaries
    - GS1 company prefix/UPC ranges
  steps:
    - OCR/parse supplier docs and images
    - >-
      Map attributes to canonical schema (composition, width, color, finish,
      care)
    - Standardize units and controlled vocab
    - Validate UPC/EAN/GTIN; flag duplicates
    - 'Create enriched content (bullets, SEO copy, sell sheet)'
    - Write back to PIM/ERP or export CSV
    - Optional human QA pass for edge cases
  tools:
    - AWS Textract/Tesseract OCR
    - OpenAI for extraction/normalization
    - GS1 check-digit validation
    - 'PIM/ERP APIs (Cin7, Acumatica, NetSuite)'
    - Image background cleanup API
  outputs:
    - Normalized item master CSV/JSON
    - 'Validation report (errors, duplicates)'
    - Sell sheets (PDF) and web copy
    - Image variants (optimized sizes)
  pricingModel:
    - Per-SKU fee with volume breaks
    - Setup fee for schema mapping
    - Optional monthly for maintenance

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier catalogs arrive as PDFs/images with inconsistent schemas; manual
      entry takes 8–15 minutes per SKU and introduces 2–6% error rates (typos,
      wrong UoM, missing attributes).
    - >-
      UPC/EAN issues: 1–3% invalid check digits or wrong digit-length;
      duplicates across suppliers cause order/inventory mismatches.
    - >-
      Attributes critical to textile/notions buyers (fiber content, width,
      weight/oz/yd, put-up/bolt length, pattern repeat, colorway, dye lot
      handling, HS code) are often missing or non-standardized; 20–40% data
      completeness gaps on first import.
    - >-
      Retailer/ecommerce channels demand normalized and channel-ready content
      (Shopify/BigCommerce/Amazon) yet wholesalers rely on static sell sheets;
      delays slow onboarding by 2–6 weeks.
    - >-
      GS1/GPC/GTIN practices vary across suppliers; lack of schema mappings and
      UoM conversions create inconsistent item masters in ERP/PIM.
    - >-
      Existing OCR/IDP tools aren’t tuned for piece goods/notions layouts
      (swatch tables, variants, color grids), causing high post-OCR cleanup
      costs.
    - >-
      Sales teams need up-to-date sell sheets; marketing needs SEO/web content;
      generating these from ERP data is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Legacy ERP/PIM imports fail due to missing required fields, causing rework
      and missed ship windows.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Capture supplier PDFs, images, spreadsheets, portal exports, and
      email attachments. Auto-detect layouts (swatch tables, color grids,
      bolt/put-up specs).
    - >-
      Extract: Fine-tuned, layout-aware OCR + vision models for textile/notions
      attributes (fiber, width, weight/oz-yd, GSM, put-up/bolt length, pattern
      repeat, dye lot handling, care, HS code, country of origin, colorway,
      collection).
    - >-
      Normalize: Map to GS1 trade item schema (GTIN, brand, net content, UoM) or
      customer schema; UoM conversions (in/cm, oz/yd to GSM, yards to meters,
      bolt to roll). De-duplicate brand/SKU aliases; variant generation
      (color/size/put-up).
    - >-
      Validate: UPC/EAN length/check-digit validation; GTIN assignment guidance;
      rules engine for required fields by channel; enrichment with controlled
      vocabularies (GPC, color standards).
    - >-
      Generate: Channel-ready content (titles, bullets, SEO descriptions), spec
      PDFs/sell sheets with swatches and barcodes, image alt text, and data
      packs for ERP/PIM import.
    - >-
      Integrate: APIs/connectors for Prophet 21, NetSuite, Dynamics 365,
      Salsify, Akeneo, and flat-file templates. Human-in-the-loop review UI with
      batch approve/push to systems.
    - >-
      Govern: Data quality dashboards, audit trails, schema versioning, and
      per-supplier scorecards to drive continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy supplier catalogs into GS1-compliant, channel-ready SKUs in
    hours, not weeks — 70% faster onboarding, 90–95% attribute extraction
    accuracy, 99.9% UPC/EAN validation, and auto-generated sell sheets/web
    content purpose-built for piece goods and notions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A niche-tuned extraction/normalization engine trained on thousands of
    textile/notions-specific layouts and attributes, plus prebuilt GS1 mappings
    and ERP/PIM connectors. Feedback loops via human-in-the-loop QA and supplier
    scorecards create a proprietary improvement cycle that general IDP or PIM
    vendors lack. Domain templates and UoM conversions (oz/yd↔GSM, bolt/roll,
    pattern repeat) are hard to replicate quickly.

    Ops/eCommerce/catalog managers at piece goods, notions, and dry goods
    wholesalers who need clean, enriched SKUs ready for ERP/PIM and web.
  problem: >-
    External: Supplier data arrives as messy PDFs/images with missing attributes
    (fiber content, width, put-up/spool, colorway, finish), unit conflicts
    (yards vs meters), variant chaos, and bad/missing UPC/EANs. Internal: Teams
    burn hours keying and cleaning, can’t scale onboarding, and fear chargebacks
    and poor buyer experiences. Philosophical: Product data should be
    standards-based, accurate, and sell-ready without manual drudgery.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived wholesale data chaos. Our AI is trained on textile/dry goods
    taxonomies and GS1, with human-in-the-loop QA, barcode validation, accuracy
    reporting, and audit trails—so you can trust every SKU.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload supplier PDFs, images, and price lists. 2) We extract attributes,
    normalize to GS1 or your schema, validate UPC/EANs, and auto-generate
    variants, sell sheets, and web copy. 3) You review in the QA portal,
    approve, and export to ERP/PIM/eCommerce via CSV/API. Agreement: No-risk
    pilot, transparent per-SKU pricing, security-first, you own your data.

    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo and start a 1,000‑SKU pilot. Transitional: Get
    a free 10‑SKU sample enrichment and our GS1 mapping checklist.
  success: >-
    A GS1-aligned, consistent catalog with verified barcodes; faster SKU launch
    and supplier onboarding; rich content that lifts conversion; instant,
    branded sell sheets; fewer errors and chargebacks; hours back to your team;
    seamless feeds to ERP/PIM/eCommerce/marketplaces.
  failure: >-
    Launches stall under PDF cleanup; attributes stay inconsistent and confuse
    buyers; barcode mistakes trigger fees; duplicate data entry multiplies
    errors; lost revenue, slow web updates, and frustrated teams.
