leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned stoppages on longwall equipment (shearer, AFC, shields) cause
      high-cost production losses (often >$30k–$150k per hour) and missed panel
      targets.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely reactive or time-based, missing early indicators of
      failures (e.g., gearbox bearing wear, leg seal leaks, chain stretch).
    - >-
      Data is siloed across OEM controllers (Cat/Komatsu-Joy/Eickhoff/ZMJ),
      SCADA/PLC (PMC-R/PMC-D/Siemens/Rockwell), and CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo/Pronto),
      making cross-system insights difficult.
    - >-
      Lack of reliable failure prediction lead time (24–72 hours) limits ability
      to plan maintenance during low-impact windows (shift changes, ventilation
      downtime, statutory checks).
    - >-
      Safety exposure increases when crews perform manual inspections in
      hazardous zones to diagnose emerging problems.
    - >-
      Limited underground connectivity and permissibility constraints make new
      sensor deployments difficult; operators need value from existing
      telemetry.
    - >-
      Spare parts procurement is misaligned with actual risk; either excess
      inventory ties up capital or stockouts extend downtime.
    - >-
      Mine technical teams are overloaded; current analytics tools are generic
      and not tuned to longwall failure modes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest existing data streams: shearer controllers (haulage/cutting motor
      currents, vibration proxies, temperatures), AFC drives (motor currents,
      gearcase temps, chain speed/torque), shield hydraulics (leg pressures,
      valve states, advance sequences), environment (gas/ventilation, strata
      events), and CMMS history.
    - >-
      Fuse and align data by face clock and cycle events (cut direction, shearer
      position, shield advance timestamps) for feature engineering per failure
      mode (e.g., leg pressure decay curves for seal leakage).
    - >-
      Train longwall-specific models for high-value failure modes: shearer
      gearbox bearings, pump overheat, haulage gearbox, AFC chain stretch and
      link failure, gearcase failure, motor insulation breakdown, shield valve
      sticking and seal leaks, hydraulic power pack faults, PMC module
      degradation.
    - >-
      Deliver explainable alerts with predicted failure mode, confidence,
      remaining useful life (RUL) band, recommended checks/spares, and suggested
      maintenance windows synchronized to shift/ventilation and panel schedule.
    - >-
      Integrate with CMMS (SAP/Maximo/Pronto) to auto-create work orders with
      parts and labor estimates; provide post-action feedback loop for model
      retraining.
    - >-
      Enable edge buffering and surface-server deployment to operate under
      intermittent connectivity and permissibility constraints (no new
      underground devices where prohibited).
    - >-
      Provide ROI dashboard quantifying downtime avoided, availability gains,
      alert precision/recall, and dollar impact to justify scaling to additional
      faces.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single, OEM-agnostic predictive health platform purpose-built for longwall
    equipment that turns existing telemetry and maintenance history into 24–72
    hour early warnings, actionable repair plans, and optimal maintenance
    windows—reducing unplanned downtime by 20–30% on target failure modes and
    improving panel availability by 1–2% with ROI in under 3 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, cross-OEM longwall failure dataset and physics-informed models
    tied to CMMS outcomes, plus permissibility-ready deployment patterns that
    avoid new underground electronics in most cases. Early reference sites and
    insurer-backed ROI validation create credibility and switching costs
    competitors lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Longwall operations and maintenance leaders who must keep the shearer, AFC,
    and shields running safely and continuously while hitting production
    targets.
  problem: >-
    Unplanned failures and mistimed maintenance cause costly downtime, safety
    risk, and budget overruns; data is noisy and siloed, so teams react instead
    of planning.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of a stalled face. Our mining engineers and data
    scientists built an OEM-agnostic AI service trained on high-frequency
    telemetry and CMMS history to flag emerging faults and recommend optimal
    maintenance windows—secure, proven, and practical underground.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect telemetry and CMMS data (edge/on-prem ready). 2) Calibrate models
    to your equipment and duty cycle. 3) Receive weekly risk forecasts and
    recommended maintenance windows integrated with work orders—pilot on one
    face, then scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute assessment or start a 90-day pilot to see risk
    forecasts on your shearer, AFC, and shields.
  success: >-
    Higher face availability, planned interventions in low-impact windows, fewer
    stoppages, safer crews, longer component life, and lower cost per tonne with
    clear ROI.
  failure: >-
    Keep flying blind: surprise chain, gearbox, motor, or hydraulic failures;
    lost tonnes, overtime firefighting, compliance exposure, and missed
    production targets.
