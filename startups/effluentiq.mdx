leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual DMR preparation is error-prone and time-consuming (typically 6–20
      staff hours/month/facility), leading to late or incorrect submissions.
    - >-
      Data lives in silos (SCADA, LIMS, handheld logs, lab PDFs), making it hard
      to compute rolling averages, seasonal limits, and permit-specific
      calculations correctly.
    - >-
      Facilities often discover exceedances after the fact; there’s limited
      real-time visibility into approaching daily, weekly, or monthly limits.
    - >-
      Complex regulatory rules (state-specific eDMR formats, TRC/chronic
      exceedance logic, MDL/qualifier handling, rounding/significant figures per
      40 CFR 136) are difficult to operationalize consistently.
    - >-
      Audit and traceability gaps (who edited what, when; whether results are
      validated) increase risk during inspections and enforcement actions.
    - >-
      Integrations with NetDMR/eDMR portals are manual and repetitive, diverting
      skilled staff away from process optimization.
    - >-
      Non-compliance carries substantial penalties (civil penalties per day per
      violation), increased scrutiny, reputational harm, and higher insurance
      costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Permit-aware monitoring: AI parses permits (PDF/Word) to extract
      parameters, units, sample frequencies, averaging periods, seasonal limits,
      qualifiers, and reporting rules.
    - >-
      Continuous limit checking: Ingests SCADA and lab data to compute
      daily/weekly/monthly averages, max/min, loading (lbs/day), seasonal rules,
      and automatically handles <MDL and qualifiers per permit rules.
    - >-
      Predictive alerts: Forecasts end-of-period averages based on current
      trends and upcoming samples; notifies operators of required corrective
      actions to avoid exceedances.
    - >-
      Auto-DMR drafting: Generates NetDMR/eDMR-ready drafts (XML/CSV where
      supported, or pre-populated forms), including rationale notes and full
      audit history for reviewer approval.
    - >-
      Data validation & QA/QC: Flags outliers, missing samples, unit mismatches,
      and calculation anomalies; enforces rounding/significant figures and
      detection-limit substitutions per permit.
    - >-
      Workflow & audit trail: Multi-step review/approval, electronic signatures,
      role-based access, and immutable logs for inspections.
    - >-
      Integrations: Connectors to SCADA (OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus via gateway),
      historians (PI, Ignition), LIMS (REST/CSV/SFTP), and lab PDFs via OCR with
      human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      Reporting & evidence: Monthly compliance packets (chain-of-custody, lab
      reports, calibrations, benchsheets) bundled for inspections and
      record-keeping.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    No-surprise compliance. EffluentIQ continuously interprets your permit,
    monitors plant data in real time, flags potential exceedances before they
    occur, and drafts audit-ready DMRs for review and submission—reducing
    violations and freeing staff time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, permit-aware rules engine and parser trained on
    thousands of real permits and DMRs, combined with a growing library of
    validated integrations to common SCADA/LIMS systems and audited calculation
    logic—all wrapped in an inspection-ready audit trail. Early relationships
    with integrators and consultants shorten deployment and RFP cycles.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and compliance leaders at sewage treatment facilities who must
    meet NPDES permit limits and file accurate, on‑time DMRs.
  problem: >-
    Permits are complex and evolving; data lives in SCADA/LIMS/spreadsheets;
    manual checks and DMR prep are slow and error‑prone—risking violations,
    fines, and audit headaches.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of NPDES compliance. Our AI, built with
    environmental compliance expertise and transparent audit trails, turns plant
    data into defensible, draft‑ready DMRs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest SCADA/LIMS/spreadsheets; import permit limits and
    averaging rules. 2) Monitor: continuously check effluent data, flag
    potential exceedances, surface trends. 3) Draft: auto‑generate DMRs with
    correct calculations, qualifiers, and explanations for review. 4) Approve &
    export: route approvals, export/submit NetDMR‑ready files, archive with full
    audit logs.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a low‑risk pilot on one outfall this
    month.
  success: >-
    Real‑time visibility, fewer surprises, faster reporting, clean audits, lower
    risk, and more time for operations improvement.
  failure: >-
    Missed exceedances, late or incorrect DMRs, penalties and consent decrees,
    audit findings, and damaged public trust.

  problem:
    - >-
      DMR prep consumes hours each month; spreadsheets and cross‑checks are
      brittle.
    - >-
      Permit limits, averaging periods, and qualifiers are complex—and change
      mid‑cycle.
    - 'Data lives in SCADA, LIMS, lab PDFs, and field notebooks.'
    - >-
      Exceedances are discovered after the reporting period—too late to prevent
      violations.
    - 'Rounding, MDL/LOQ handling, and unit conversions cause costly errors.'
    - Missed samples and invalid data create gaps and rework.
    - Audits and NOVs require documentation your team has to chase down.
  solution:
    - Real‑time monitoring of effluent data against NPDES permit limits.
    - >-
      Permit‑aware rule engine for outfalls, parameters, frequencies, and
      averaging (daily max, monthly average, geometric mean).
    - >-
      Immediate alerts for potential exceedances, missed samples, and data
      quality issues.
    - >-
      Automatic DMR draft with pre‑populated values, qualifiers, and

    - >-
      Team workflow with reviewer/approver roles and electronic sign‑off (no
      auto‑submission without approval).
  features:
    - >-
      Permit parser: upload your permit; we map limits, monitoring locations,
      and schedules.
    - 'Integrations: SCADA/data historian, LIMS, lab EDDs, CSV/manual entry.'
    - >-
      Calculation engine: daily max/min, monthly average, geometric mean,
      flow‑weighted averages, and loadings (lbs/day).
    - 'LOQ/MDL handling: J/U flags, substitution rules, and precision per permit.'
    - >-
      Automated rounding and unit conversion aligned with 40 CFR guidance and
      permit conditions.
    - >-
      Smart alerts: threshold forecasts, trend anomalies, and wet‑weather
      context.
    - 'Compliance calendar: sampling schedules, hold points, and reminders.'
    - >-
      Auto‑validate: cross‑footing, completeness checks, reason codes, and a
      reusable comment library.
    - >-
      Evidence bundle: lab reports, chain‑of‑custody, data lineage, and change
      history in one place.

      export/submission.
  steps:
    - 'Connect data sources (SCADA/historian, LIMS, lab EDDs, manual forms).'
    - 'Upload permit; confirm outfalls, parameters, and limits.'
    - Set alert thresholds and notification routes.
    - System monitors in real time; flags issues before they become violations.
    - Review Auto‑DMR draft with evidence; add comments as needed.
    - Approve and export to NetDMR/eDMR; retain a signed audit trail.
    - Track submissions and KPIs on the compliance dashboard.
