  problem:
    - >-
      Families eligible for multiple programs (SNAP, WIC, Medicaid/CHIP, child
      care subsidies, housing assistance, LIHEAP, tax credits) face fragmented
      portals and redundant paperwork, causing 25–50% drop-off before
      submission.
    - >-
      Child and youth services caseworkers spend 30–40% of their time on
      paperwork, chasing documents, and re-keying data instead of direct
      support.
    - >-
      Low benefit take-up persists: ~20% of EITC-eligible families don’t claim;
      WIC participation lags eligibility; child care subsidies are heavily
      underutilized due to administrative burden.
    - >-
      Approval delays (weeks to months) exacerbate family instability; missing
      documents and errors trigger rework and denials.
    - >-
      Agencies lack cross-program visibility and analytics to target outreach,
      measure outcomes, and reduce inequities across language, literacy, and
      access barriers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal, dynamic screener for eligibility across key state and local
      programs with plain-language questions and multilingual support.
    - >-
      Auto pre-fill of forms using structured data from case files, EHR/claims
      (with consent), and prior applications; human-in-the-loop final review.
    - >-
      Document capture via mobile camera, SMS/email upload, or kiosk; OCR and
      classification to required checklists; quality checks for completeness.
    - >-
      Integrated e-signature and identity verification; configurable consent
      flows; role-based access; complete audit trail.
    - >-
      Automated submission to portals (API where available, otherwise
      e-fax/mail/secure upload) with status tracking and resubmission workflows.
    - >-
      Closed-loop referrals to community resources (food pantries, legal aid,
      parenting classes, housing support) with configurable follow-up nudges.
    - >-
      Rules engine with version control and citations; state-by-state program
      adapters; rapid updates when policies change.
    - >-
      Dashboards for supervisors: throughput, approval rates, error hotspots,
      equity metrics (language/zip), and ROI (estimated benefits unlocked, time
      saved).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A secure, multilingual AI navigator that screens families once, pre-fills
    multi-program applications, orchestrates document collection and
    e-signature, and submits to the right agencies—reducing time-to-benefits by
    up to 50%, increasing completed applications by 20–30%, and cutting
    caseworker admin time by 25–35%, with full auditability and public-sector
    compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, multi-program rules and document intelligence
    library tuned for families and child welfare, coupled with procurement-ready
    security/compliance and deep integrations into CCWIS and referral platforms;
    over time, proprietary outcomes data improves pre-fill, document prompts,
    and approval likelihood models, creating a defensible feedback loop and
    switching costs.
