  problem:
    - >-
      Start-up scrap during changeovers is high (typically 2–6% of run volume),
      driven by incorrect initial feeder rates and temperature profiles.
    - >-
      Setups are slow and variable (60–120 minutes typical for multi-additive
      jobs) due to trial-and-error dialing-in and tribal knowledge gaps.
    - >-
      Run-cards/instructions are inconsistent and often outdated, causing
      operator confusion and quality drift; revision control and sign-off are
      manual.
    - >-
      Scaling learned settings from one line to another (different L/D, screw
      design, feeders) is error-prone, leading to off-spec lots and rework.
    - >-
      Material property variability (e.g., MFR ±10–20%, moisture content) is not
      translated into dynamic settings, causing instability early in the run.
    - >-
      Quality KPIs (FPY, color delta E, tensile/impact) drift because settings
      are not tied to measurable outputs like torque, melt pressure, or specific
      energy input (SEI).
    - >-
      Feeder capacity/accuracy constraints (min rate, turn-down ratio, refill
      spikes) aren’t accounted for in planning, causing rate oscillations and
      surging.
    - >-
      ERP/MES/LIMS systems store recipes but don’t compute machine-specific
      settings, leaving a gap between formulation and executable process.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI engine translates formulations and material properties (MFR, density,
      moisture, Tm/Tg) plus machine data (screw/L-D, vents, feeders, zone count)
      into optimal feeder rates and barrel/die temperature profiles.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimizer respects feeder min/max, turn-down ratios,
      refill logic, and desired total throughput; flags infeasible recipes
      pre-run.
    - >-
      Start-up playbooks: ramp schedule for temperatures and screw RPM, vacuum
      timing, purge material usage, and stabilization criteria (torque, melt
      pressure, SEI).
    - >-
      Feedback loop ingests actuals (throughput, torque, melt temp/pressure, QC
      data) to refine next-run recommendations per formulation-machine pair.
    - >-
      Printable/ERP-linked run-cards with QR codes, e-sign, and revision control
      (ISO 9001/IATF 16949 ready); pushes instructions to MES/ERP work orders.
    - >-
      What-if and line-porting tools to adapt a recipe from Line A to Line B
      considering different screws/feeders with expected output and risk score.
    - >-
      Anomaly and risk alerts: predicts likelihood of surging, feeder
      starvation, or color drift; suggests corrective adjustments with
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Compliance pack: auditable change history, operator acknowledgment, and
      specification linkage to LIMS for COA traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Right-first-time compounding. FeedRun.AI turns your formulation, resin
    properties, and machine constraints into validated feeder rates, zone
    temperatures, and start-up sequences—then generates ERP-linked,
    revision-controlled run-cards. Cut start-up scrap 25–40%, reduce setup time
    15–30%, and lift first-pass yield by 2–5 percentage points within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Polymer-specific optimization models with embedded physics/constraints plus
    federated learning across non-competing plants to generalize without
    exposing proprietary recipes. Deep OEM integrations to feeder/extruder
    controllers and a validated run-card compliance workflow that most analytics
    vendors lack.

    Process engineers, production managers, and compounding operators at
    plastics processors who need fast, repeatable setups for custom blends on
    specific machines.
  problem: >-
    Villain: guesswork and tribal knowledge. External: manual calculations,
    inconsistent parameters, ERP/MES disconnects. Internal: pressure to hit
    rates without scrap or delays. Philosophical: setting up a run shouldn’t be
    trial-and-error.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pain of dialing in feeders and zone temps while the line
    waits. Our AI, trained on your formulations, machines, and historical runs,
    recommends validated feeder rates, barrel temperatures, and startup
    settings—integrated with your ERP/MES and backed by audit trails.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and define formulations/machines. 2) Auto-generate
    recommended feeder rates, zone temps, and startup steps. 3) Approve and
    publish printable/ERP-linked run-cards. 4) Capture results; models learn and
    improve every run.
