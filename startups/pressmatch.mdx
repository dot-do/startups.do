  problem:
    - >-
      Media list building is slow and manual: 2–6 hours per campaign to
      research, vet, and compile 50–200 journalists from disparate sources.
    - >-
      High irrelevance rates: 30–60% of contacts on typical lists are off-beat
      or stale, depressing open/reply rates and placements.
    - >-
      Databases are often stale or opaque: limited recency signals, black-box
      scores, and weak justification for why a contact is relevant now.
    - >-
      Fragmented data and compliance risk: journalist info scattered across
      platforms; GDPR/CCPA consent and opt-out preferences not consistently
      tracked.
    - >-
      Difficult to measure impact of research quality: agencies can’t easily
      correlate list quality to outcomes (coverage, replies, placements).
  solution:
    - >-
      Semantic topic-to-journalist matching: transform a pitch/brief into
      embeddings; match across licensed news, bylines, and public signals to
      rank likely-relevant journalists.
    - >-
      Relevance scoring with transparency: scores factor recent coverage
      recency, beat consistency, outlet authority, engagement, and historical
      acceptance signals; each contact includes explain-why snippets and source
      citations.
    - >-
      Always-fresh profiles: nightly refresh of articles, bylines, beats, and
      role changes; deduplication across sources; email confidence labeling and
      verification.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: import outreach outcomes (opens, replies, placements) from
      CRM/PR tools to continuously improve the scoring model for each vertical.
    - >-
      Compliance and preferences: track opt-outs/Do Not Contact flags, regional
      compliance (GDPR/CCPA), and personal-contact vs role-based contact rules.
    - >-
      One-click export and integrations: push lists to HubSpot, Salesforce,
      Mailchimp, and PR CRMs; CSV export with confidence tags and justification
      notes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Build a targeted, explainable journalist list in under 10 minutes with 70%+
    precision in the top 20 results, reducing research time by 80% and
    increasing placement rates 20–30% versus baseline lists.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop relevance training data from real outreach outcomes across
    agencies, combined with explainable score components and high-frequency data
    refresh under compliance guardrails—difficult for incumbents to replicate
    quickly without re-architecting legacy products.
