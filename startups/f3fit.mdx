  problem:
    - >-
      Remote renters lack accurate measurements, causing 15–35% exchanges and
      late-event risks for rental businesses.
    - >-
      Scheduling in-store fittings is inconvenient; average renter lead time is
      <14 days for events (prom, weddings, Halloween), making resizes costly
      ($18–$35 per exchange: two-way shipping, handling, re-pressing).
    - >-
      Brand size charts are inconsistent and rarely rental-optimized (garment
      ease, alterations, wear tolerance), forcing staff to ‘guess’ sizes from
      height/weight or past orders.
    - >-
      Current photo/video measuring tools require long capture flows or special
      suits; completion rates for renters are <60% and support tickets spike
      during peak seasons.
    - >-
      SMBs lack data to QA fit: no confidence scores, no error bounds, and no
      analytics by body region/garment, limiting continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Group orders (wedding parties, theater casts) suffer from coordination
      issues; 10–20% of members submit measurements late or incorrectly, driving
      rush fees and overtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Asynchronous 2-photo capture (front + side) with on-screen guidance and
      object-of-known-size calibration (A4 paper or card) to estimate key
      measurements (chest, waist, hip, seat, thighs, outseam/inseam proxy,
      back/shoulder, neck) with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Rental-optimized size mapping: convert measurements to recommended sizes
      by garment category and brand (jacket, pants, shirt, vest, dress)
      reflecting ease, garment tolerance, and alteration thresholds.
    - >-
      Confidence-aware recommendations: if confidence < threshold or fit risk is
      high, trigger size-up/size-down fallback rules or request a quick
      re-capture.
    - >-
      White-label SDK + API for web and mobile checkout flows; results returned
      in <60 seconds for 95th percentile, with error bounds and a recommendation
      rationale.
    - >-
      Group ordering: shareable codes for parties/casts, progress dashboard for
      coordinators, auto-reminders, and bulk export to POS/warehouse.
    - >-
      Fit analytics: dashboards showing exchange rate reductions, MAE vs. tailor
      tape, cohort analysis by event, and brand/garment heatmaps.
    - >-
      Privacy-by-design: on-device pre-processing option, regional data
      residency, configurable retention, and SOC2/GDPR readiness.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Two photos in under 60 seconds yield rental-ready body measurements with
    confidence intervals and brand-specific size recommendations per garment
    category—reducing exchanges by 25–40% and cutting fitting friction without
    in-store visits.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rental-optimized dataset and sizing engine tuned to time-critical events,
    brand tolerances, and alteration policies, combined with closed-loop
    learning from exchanges/returns across partners. Exclusive or early-access
    brand mappings and group-order workflows make replication difficult for
    generalist fit-tech vendors.
