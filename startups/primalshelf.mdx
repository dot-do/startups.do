  problem:
    - >-
      Fresh and chilled meat lots lose value rapidly; 0.5–1.5% of wholesaler
      revenue is typically lost to shrink/spoilage and past-date markdowns.
    - >-
      Lot aging visibility is fragmented across ERP/WMS/Excel; FEFO is
      inconsistently applied, creating avoidable write-offs and customer
      rejections for insufficient remaining shelf life (RSL).
    - >-
      Demand volatility by cut/spec and customer RSL policies makes it hard to
      match aging inventory to orders in time; sales teams lack prioritized call
      lists to move at-risk product.
    - >-
      Transfers between DCs and freeze/convert options are decided late without
      ROI-based guidance, wasting cold-chain capacity and labor.
    - >-
      Catch-weight complexity (variable weight items) and incomplete temperature
      exposure data make static shelf-life rules inaccurate.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (USDA FSIS, HACCP, GFSI) requires auditable lot
      decisions; current workflows lack traceable rationale for markdowns,
      reallocations, or FEFO overrides.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time lot aging and risk scoring (0–100) combining pack/kill date,
      product/cut, packaging, temperature exposure, and demand outlook.
    - >-
      Customer RSL-aware matching that prioritizes orders/customers likely to
      accept remaining shelf life and volume by cut/spec.
    - >-
      Action recommendations with ROI: targeted customer offers,
      pricing/markdown guidance, DC-to-DC transfers, freeze/convert (e.g., fresh
      to frozen, trim to grind) suggestions.
    - >-
      Automated sales enablement: daily prioritized call lists by rep and
      account; EDI-ready inventory availability (846) with at-risk flags; promo
      windows.
    - >-
      FEFO execution assurance: alerts on FEFO violations and pick path
      exceptions; tasks pushed to WMS/TMS.
    - >-
      Scenario simulator: see shrink vs margin impact of markdown percent,
      transfer timing, or freeze decisions before committing.
    - >-
      Compliance-grade audit trail: captures data, rationale, approvals, and
      outcomes for HACCP/FSIS/SQF audits and customer disputes.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box integrations for common ERP/WMS/EDI and cold-chain IoT
      sensors; SOC 2-ready security posture.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut shrink 25–40% in 90 days by turning aging meat lots into targeted orders
    at the right price. PrimalShelf AI unifies lot aging, dynamic shelf-life,
    demand, and customer RSL into one action engine that recommends who to sell
    to, at what price, when to transfer or freeze, and documents every decision
    for audit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific dynamic shelf-life modeling fused with IoT temperature
    exposure and customer-specific RSL rules, plus a growing, anonymized
    benchmark dataset across meat wholesalers that improves recommendations.
    Deep ERP/WMS/EDI integrations allow pushing actions directly into sales
    orders, pick waves, and EDI 846/850 flows with a compliance-grade audit
    trail.

  character: >-
    Ops, inventory, and sales managers at meat merchant wholesalers who must
    move dated lots (FEFO) before expiry while protecting margins and service
    levels.
  problem: >-
    Perishable lots age fast, demand is lumpy, and spreadsheets hide FEFO
    risk—leading to late discounts, spoilage write‑offs, chargebacks, and lost
    trust. Food should feed people, not landfills.
  guide: >-
    We understand cold‑chain pressure and dated-lot complexity. Our AI, built
    for meat industry data and workflows, surfaces risk early and recommends
    profitable, compliant actions—without disrupting your ERP/WMS.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/WMS/QA data and shelf‑life rules. 2) Get a daily, risk‑ranked
    action queue—moves, markdowns, and customer/order targets to consume at‑risk
    lots. 3) Execute in your systems while we track outcomes and continuously
    optimize. Secure, traceable, and audit‑ready.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30‑minute risk snapshot and start a 30‑day pilot on your data.
  success: >-
    Fewer write‑offs, smarter discounts, higher fill rates, faster turns, freed
    working capital, happier customers, less waste, and stronger compliance.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting with spreadsheets, discounting too late, writing off
    product, eroding margins and customer trust while edible meat goes to waste.

  problem:
    - Short-dated lots get missed until write-off day.
