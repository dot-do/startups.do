leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Berth congestion and uncertain terminal line-ups cause avoidable anchorage
      time (often 6–24 hours per call) in Coastal and Great Lakes ports.
    - >-
      Operations duration is hard to predict due to variable labor shifts,
      weather/ice, locks and pilotage windows, draft restrictions, inspections,
      and terminal productivity.
    - >-
      Line-up and nomination information is trapped in unstructured emails and
      spreadsheets; agents and operators spend hours reconciling changes.
    - >-
      No coordinated mechanism to propose and execute mutually beneficial
      berth-window swaps across vessels, charterers, and terminals.
    - >-
      Demurrage and lost time cost owners/charterers $500–1,500 per hour;
      terminals lose throughput and reliability; ports face congestion and
      emissions.
    - >-
      Stakeholders lack a shared, trusted forecast that reconciles AIS, terminal
      schedules, and regulatory constraints, creating misaligned arrivals and
      last-minute rushes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automate ingestion of terminal line-ups, agent emails, PDFs, and
      spreadsheets; normalize into a live berth plan per port/terminal.
    - >-
      Predict cargo ops duration by vessel/cargo/berth using ML models trained
      on historical calls, weather/ice, labor shift calendars, and lock/pilot
      constraints.
    - >-
      Optimize arrival times and propose berth-window swaps that minimize total
      waiting subject to charter-party, laycan, pilotage, and draft rules.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: what-if tools for ETAs, weather delays, lock closures;
      simulate impacts on berth plans and demurrage.
    - >-
      One-click collaboration: notify agents/charterers/terminals of proposed
      ETAs and swaps; capture approvals and generate a digital audit trail.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with AIS, weather/ice, Veson IMOS, Dataloy, SEDNA,
      Outlook/Gmail to keep the plan synchronized.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce anchorage and berth idle time by 3–8 hours per port call through
    AI-predicted ops durations and actionable arrival-time and window-swap
    recommendations, delivered in a shared, auditable plan integrated with your
    email, AIS, lock schedules, and terminal line-ups.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary dataset of terminal line-ups, agent emails, and
    realized ops outcomes in Great Lakes/coastal ports enables superior
    prediction accuracy; a window-swap network with standardized legal templates
    and multi-party approvals creates marketplace effects that are hard to
    replicate; early integrations with IMOS/Dataloy/SEDNA and lock/pilot
    authorities embed BW+PCO into critical workflows.
