leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual registration prep is slow and costly: 45–90 minutes per claim for
      paralegals/admins, driving $35–$90 labor cost per claim before fees.
    - >-
      High error/correspondence rates (5–15%) from metadata mismatches
      (ISWC/ISRC/UPC), split discrepancies, and deposit issues delay
      certificates by weeks/months.
    - >-
      Complex and changing group registration rules (albums, unpublished works,
      serials) make it hard to minimize fees and claims count without risking
      refusals.
    - >-
      Backlogs accumulate (hundreds to thousands of unregistered works) after
      catalog acquisitions or release spikes, exposing the catalog to avoidable
      infringement damages risk.
    - >-
      Metadata lives in silos (CWR/DDEX exports, label copy, PRO/MLC portals,
      Box/Drive) making intake and reconciliation tedious and error-prone.
    - >-
      Limited internal eCO expertise; turnover and training gaps create
      bottlenecks and inconsistent quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted intake that ingests CWR/DDEX/CSV/Excel, label copy, and
      audio/PDF deposits; auto-reconciles titles, writers, splits,
      ISWC/ISRC/UPC, and role attributions.
    - >-
      Rules engine plans optimal, policy-compliant grouping to minimize
      claims/fees while preserving acceptance likelihood; shows savings and risk
      scoring.
    - >-
      Automated packet assembly: correct application type selection (e.g.,
      musical work vs sound recording), attachment prep, deposit formatting, and
      docketing metadata.
    - >-
      QC with human-in-the-loop paralegal review for edge cases (work-for-hire,
      compilations, chain-of-title/assignments).
    - >-
      Filing options: (1) agent filing under client authorization; (2) turnkey
      handoff with export of packet + step-by-step eCO filing instructions; (3)
      hybrid for internal review before submission.
    - >-
      Lifecycle tracking: status monitoring, correspondence management,
      certificate capture, and catalog registry updates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prepare and (optionally) file USCO-ready registration packets 70% faster
    with <2% correspondence rate, reduce claims (and fees) 15–35% via compliant
    grouping, and clear registration backlogs 10× faster—without adding
    headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Outcome-optimized rules engine and acceptance heuristics trained on
    high-volume, labeled registration outcomes in music-specific contexts,
    combined with deep catalog integrations and human-in-the-loop QA—delivering
    consistently higher acceptance and fee savings than generic legal form
    fillers or DIY eCO. Early mover enterprise focus in music publication
    workflows (DDEX/CWR-aware) strengthens switching costs via embedded
    processes and historical audit trails.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    U.S. music publishers and rights administrators who need fast, accurate
    copyright registrations for works and sound recordings across growing
    catalogs.
  problem: >-
    Manual eCO workflows are slow and error-prone; messy metadata, contributor
    splits, and deposit rules cause delays and refusals, risking priority dates
    and royalties.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect catalogs without slowing releases.
    Built by music rights ops and IP tech specialists, our AI prepares
    USCO-compliant packets with acceptance-focused validation and audit trails.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect catalog and select titles. 2) AI normalizes metadata, validates
    claims, and assembles deposits and forms for works and sound recordings
    (single or grouped). 3) Approve and file via our eCO service or receive a
    ready-to-upload package, then track status through to certificates.
  callToAction: Book a 15-minute demo to start a 2-week pilot on a subset of your catalog.
  success: >-
    Register more titles in less time, cut refusals, secure priority dates,
    maintain clean chain-of-title and audit-ready records, and redeploy staff to
    signing and exploitation.
  failure: >-
    Avoid filing backlogs, refusals, resubmissions, lost priority, ownership
    disputes, and missed royalty windows.
