leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Disease timing is often off by 5–10 days relative to critical growth
      stages (R1–R6), reducing fungicide efficacy and ROI.
    - >-
      Uniform, whole-field sprays waste 10–30% of acres in low-risk zones due to
      microclimate variability (canopy closure, topography, soil moisture).
    - >-
      Growers and agronomists lack zone-level, near-term risk forecasts tied to
      phenology; weather-only tools don’t translate to “when and where to act.”
    - >-
      Scouting resources are limited; fields are prioritized by intuition vs.
      quantified risk, causing misses on early outbreaks (white mold apothecia
      emergence, frogeye sporulation, rust fronts).
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across equipment platforms, imagery, and weather;
      current workflows require manual stitching and lack actionable alerts.
    - >-
      Retailers/consultants need scalable decision support across 50k–500k acres
      with clear documentation of recommendations for compliance and grower
      trust.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily field- and zone-level risk scores (0–100) for white mold, frogeye,
      and rust using ensemble weather, canopy/leaf wetness modeling, variety
      susceptibility, topography, and cropping history.
    - >-
      Phenology-aware spray windows: R1–R6 stage detection with GDD/canopy
      closure modeling to flag optimal 3–5 day application windows and backup
      windows if weather delays.
    - >-
      Zone prescriptions: Split fields into micro-zones using elevation, soil,
      historical yield, and canopy indices to recommend where to scout and where
      to spray (and where to skip).
    - >-
      Scouting prioritization: Dynamic queue of fields/zones ranked by risk and
      urgency; in-field checklists to confirm symptoms and feed model learning.
    - >-
      Economic impact layer: Per-field ROI calculator combining product cost,
      app cost, custom application, expected yield response, and soybean price
      to support go/no-go decisions.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: One-click sharing to growers/retailers;
      compatibility with Ops Center, FieldView, and shapefile exports for
      application maps; SMS/app/email alerts when windows open/close.
    - >-
      Validation and transparency: Field trial dashboards with strip-trial
      templates and season reports documenting decisions, outcomes, and model
      accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable 3–7 day spray timing windows and zone-level disease risk maps for
    white mold, frogeye leaf spot, and soybean rust—tied to field-specific
    phenology—so growers and agronomists can target the right acres at the right
    time, cut unnecessary sprays by 15–30%, and capture 1–3 bu/ac yield
    protection with a simple, integrated workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, proprietary dataset of zone-level disease
    observations tied to phenology and microclimate, collected through
    retailer-enabled trials and in-app scouting, powering hybrid models that
    deliver earlier, more precise spray windows than weather-only tools;
    reinforced by deep integrations with dominant farm platforms and co-ops for
    low-friction adoption and stickiness.

  problem:
    - >-
      Disease pressure is patchy and timing‑critical—R1–R5 windows are easy to
      miss.
    - County or regional alerts are too coarse for field‑level decisions.
    - Blanket sprays waste money and fuel; skipping a hot spot costs bushels.
    - Scouting resources can’t cover every field when weather turns.
    - Weather‑driven risk shifts daily; spreadsheets and gut feel can’t keep up.
    - Sprayer capacity and weather windows rarely align without a plan.
  solution:
    - 'Field‑ and zone‑level AI risk scores for white mold, frogeye, and rust.'
    - 7–14 day scouting and spray timing windows aligned to R1–R5 growth stages.
    - 'Push alerts when risk exceeds your threshold, with confidence indicators.'
    - Actionable plans sized to your sprayer capacity—block or zone targeting.
