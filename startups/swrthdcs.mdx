  problem:
    - >-
      Boat builders must produce extensive documentation to meet CE (RCD II
      2013/53/EU), ABYC/NMMA, and USCG requirements; this typically takes 30–120
      engineer hours per model and 5–20 hours per hull to update, delaying
      launches and tying up senior staff.
    - >-
      Manual compilation from CAD/BOM/Electrical schematics to owner's manuals,
      labels, and checklists is error-prone, leading to audit findings, rework,
      and shipment holds; first-pass audit failure rates of 20–40% are common
      for smaller yards.
    - >-
      Regulatory changes (e.g., ABYC annual updates, new/updated harmonized ISO
      standards under RCD II) require continuous monitoring; most builders lack
      in-house regulatory tracking, creating compliance drift.
    - >-
      Documentation is often siloed across PLM, CAD, ERP, and shared drives;
      lack of traceability and version control makes it hard to prove conformity
      on a per-hull basis during audits and warranty claims.
    - >-
      Non-compliance risk is financially material: rework, fines, forced
      retrofits/recalls, warranty exposure, and lost dealer confidence; single
      non-compliance events can exceed $50k–$250k in downstream costs.
    - >-
      Export complexity: builders selling into both US and EU must produce
      overlapping but different artifacts (e.g., CE Technical File and DoC,
      ABYC/NMMA checklists, USCG labels) without duplication or inconsistencies.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest engineering data (CAD metadata, BOM, electrical schematics,
      weight/stability inputs, engine and fuel system specs) via connectors/APIs
      or secure uploads.
    - >-
      Map engineering attributes to requirement rules across CE (RCD II
      harmonized ISO standards), ABYC standards, and USCG CFR to determine
      applicable clauses for each model/hull.
    - >-
      Auto-generate documentation artifacts: CE Technical File sections,
      Declaration of Conformity, Owner’s Manual sections (ISO 14945-aligned),
      ABYC/NMMA checklists, USCG-required labels/markings, capacity/builder’s
      plates.
    - >-
      Produce compliant labels and markings (e.g., ABYC H-5 capacity, CE
      builder’s plate information, HIN labeling), including dimensioning and
      language requirements, ready for print or CNC/laser etching.
    - >-
      Provide an audit-ready traceability matrix linking each requirement to
      evidence (drawings, test reports, calculations, supplier datasheets), with
      versioning and e-signatures.
    - >-
      Continuously monitor standards updates; flag impacted models/clauses and
      propose redlines to docs; maintain a change log for notified body review.
    - >-
      Export to standardized, submission-ready formats (PDF/A, XML/JSON for
      APIs) with per-hull serialization; batch-generate packs for production
      runs.
    - >-
      Collaborate with Notified Bodies/consultants through shareable,
      permissioned review portals with comments and corrective action tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-ready CE/ABYC/USCG document packs from your engineering data
    in minutes, not weeks—complete with owner’s manual content, labels,
    checklists, and traceability—cutting doc prep time by 70–90% while improving
    first-pass audit success to >90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, marine-specific compliance knowledge graph and rules
    engine co-developed with Notified Bodies and ABYC/NMMA advisors, plus a
    growing corpus of anonymized, per-hull evidence-to-requirement mappings that
    improve precision and audit acceptance over time—difficult for generalist
    doc tools or new entrants to replicate.

  character: >-
    Boat builders, naval architects, and compliance managers who need
    CE/ABYC/USCG-ready boats without drowning in paperwork.
  problem: >-
    Compliance docs are fragmented and manual. RCD (CE), ABYC, and USCG rules
    overlap and change; copy-paste from CAD/BOM creates errors; versions drift;
    audits stall programs; missing labels or manual sections trigger delays,
    fines, or rework. They feel stuck doing paperwork instead of building boats.
  guide: >-
    We’re marine compliance and software experts. Our AI maps engineering data
    to RCD 2013/53/EU, ABYC, and USCG requirements using vetted templates,
    change tracking, and audit trails—secure, traceable, and kept current with
    standards.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect CAD/BOM/test data via upload or API. 2) Auto-generate the full
    pack: DoC/Annexes, ABYC/USCG checklists, owner’s manual sections, and
    capacity/HIN/ventilation/ignition labels. 3) Review, e-sign, export
    (PDF/Word/label files), and maintain a living, version-controlled baseline.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute demo or upload a sample dataset for a free compliance
    gap snapshot.
  success: >-
    Cut documentation time by 70–90%, pass inspections on the first attempt,
    ship on schedule to EU and US markets, maintain a single source of truth
    with traceability, and free engineers to build better boats.
  failure: >-
    Keep fighting spreadsheets, miss clauses, get stuck in audits, pay fines,
    face customs holds or recalls, delay launches, and erode dealer and customer
    trust.
