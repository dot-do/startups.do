leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Substrate waste from suboptimal imposition/ganging is typically 1–4% above
      theoretical minimum, eroding gross margins on commodity
      cartons/containers.
    - >-
      High make-ready time (20–45 minutes/job on sheetfed presses; 10–25
      minutes/tooling on die cutters) caused by avoidable plate/die changeovers
      and poor batch sequencing.
    - >-
      Schedulers and prepress teams lack a single tool to automatically find
      cross-job ganging opportunities across open orders on the same stock,
      caliper, grain direction, and color set.
    - >-
      Existing imposition tools work job-by-job and ignore plant constraints
      (press width, die availability, gluer windows, WIP buffers, delivery due
      dates/penalties).
    - >-
      Frequent short runs and SKU proliferation increase setups and paperboard
      scrap, overwhelming manual planners and tribal-knowledge heuristics.
    - >-
      Disconnected data across MIS/ERP, prepress, and shop-floor systems
      prevents dynamic optimization based on real availability and priorities.
    - >-
      Inefficient use of common dies and legacy die libraries increases tooling
      costs and time-to-press.
    - >-
      Volatile board lead times and costs require better stock utilization and
      proactive consolidation to hit OTD and margin targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI optimization engine that proposes gang layouts across all open orders
      sharing stock/caliper/grain/ink set, maximizing sheet utilization and
      minimizing changeovers.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware scheduling that sequences press and die-cutter runs to
      minimize wash-ups, plate/die changes, and gluer setups while respecting
      due dates and WIP buffers.
    - >-
      Die library intelligence that recommends reuse of existing dies and
      highlights ROI for new combo dies when savings exceed a configurable
      threshold.
    - >-
      What-if simulator for planners to test scenarios (e.g., “hold Job X 24
      hours to gang with Jobs Y/Z”) with instant impact on waste, make-ready,
      and OTD risk.
    - >-
      Automated imposition export to prepress (Esko, Prinect, Preps) with press
      marks, grain alignment, nicks, and chase sizes respected.
    - >-
      Live data integration with MIS/ERP for orders, due dates, routings, stock
      availability; and optional machine data (IoT) for actual speeds and
      downtime.
    - >-
      Inventory-sensitive optimization that prioritizes jobs to deplete aging
      stock and reduce partial pallets/odd lots.
    - >-
      Sustainability analytics reporting CO2e and fiber savings tied to
      optimizer decisions for customer scorecards.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly approval workflow: planner reviews recommended gangs,
      accepts/edits, logs reasons for overrides for continuous learning.
    - >-
      Performance dashboards highlighting realized vs. projected savings,
      acceptance rates, and bottlenecks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce paperboard waste by 1–3% and make-ready time by 10–25% by
    automatically ganging compatible SKUs across open jobs on the same stock and
    tooling, using an AI-driven optimizer that accounts for real plant
    constraints and integrates with your MIS and prepress. Typical payback < 6
    months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A constraint-aware optimization engine trained on real plant data and
    enriched by die-library intelligence, combined with turnkey integrations to
    MIS/prepress and a pilot-to-ROI motion that quantifies savings. Anonymized
    benchmarks create a data network effect competitors without cross-customer
    insights cannot easily replicate.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, schedulers, and prepress leads at paperboard container
    manufacturers (NAICS 322219) who must keep presses full, waste low, and
    orders on time.
  problem: >-
    External: Suboptimal ganging and imposition across open jobs on the same
    stock drives sheet waste, make‑readies, and changeovers. Internal: It’s hard
    to see the best plan across a live queue, dies, coatings, and due windows—so
    teams feel like they’re leaving money on the floor. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t have to waste board and hours because the optimal plan is
    invisible.
  guide: >-
    We understand mixed SKUs, die libraries, coatings, calipers, grain, and
    tight windows. Our AI optimizer is built by print-tech engineers, integrates
    with MIS/ERP and prepress, and provides auditable recommendations your team
    can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Sync open jobs, stock specs, die library, and constraints from
    your MIS/ERP and prepress. 2) Pilot: Run on one press/stock family; compare
    utilization and make‑readies; tune rules. 3) Go live: Push daily gang plans
    and press forms, with savings estimates and KPI tracking—your team approves
    before release.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute fit assessment. Transitional: Request a free
    sample optimization using this week’s jobs.
  success: >-
    Higher sheet utilization, fewer make‑readies and wash‑ups, steadier
    schedules, lower board and energy use, improved margins, stronger on‑time
    performance, happier customers, and defensible sustainability metrics.
  failure: >-
    Continued board waste, excessive changeovers and overtime, missed ship
    windows, rushed freight, margin erosion, and a stressed production team.
