  problem:
    - >-
      High cost and time waste from sending conservators or couriers to view
      works that are later rejected (travel/attendance often $500–$2,000 per
      visit).
    - >-
      Inconsistent, low-quality seller photos (glare, focus, wrong angles) delay
      intake and cause back-and-forth, adding 3–7 days to deal cycles.
    - >-
      Manual triage misses visible issues (edge wear, surface abrasion,
      punctures, canvas deformation) under time pressure, creating pricing
      errors and post-sale disputes.
    - >-
      Registrars and specialists spend 20–40% of admin time chasing better
      imagery and documenting preliminary condition notes.
    - >-
      Shipping or conservation booked prematurely for works later found to be
      unsuitable, leading to sunk costs and strained relationships.
    - >-
      Reputational and legal risk from inaccurate preliminary condition
      assessments; lack of standardized pre-screen process across teams and
      offices.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer-vision model analyzes intake photos in seconds to flag visible
      condition issues (tears, losses, abrasions, deformations, stains, foxing,
      craquelure patterns, frame damage).
    - >-
      Automated image-quality QC (resolution, focus, glare, color cast,
      cropping, metadata checks) and a tailored reshoot checklist (e.g., raking
      light left/right, macro of edges, verso, stretcher, UV).
    - >-
      Risk scoring per artwork (green/amber/red) with confidence levels and
      suggested actions (proceed, request more images, escalate to conservator).
    - >-
      Medium-aware triage (oil on canvas, panel, works on paper, photographs,
      sculpture) with customizable detection thresholds and taxonomies.
    - >-
      One-click preliminary report to share with sellers/clients; export to
      PDF/CSV and push to existing collection/consignment systems.
    - >-
      Inbox/API ingestion: auto-detect new submissions from email attachments or
      integrated systems, tag and queue for review; Slack/Teams alerts.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop add-on: rapid conservator review within 24h for
      borderline cases; results integrated in the same report.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, AI-driven photo pre-screen that flags visible condition risks and
    image-quality gaps, generates a precise reshoot request list, and
    standardizes preliminary triage—cutting unnecessary travel and conservation
    intake by 20–40% while accelerating deal decisions by days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Conservator-validated, proprietary dataset and taxonomy tied to art-specific
    defects and shot protocols, reinforced by workflow integrations where
    dealers already work—creating a defensible feedback loop and switching costs
    that generic vision APIs or horizontal tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Art dealers, gallerists, auction specialists, and registrars who need a
    fast, low-risk read on condition before committing to conservation or
    travel.
  problem: >-
    External: Incomplete or poor images hide issues and waste time. Internal:
    Anxiety about costly surprises and strained client trust. Philosophical:
    Assessing cultural assets shouldn’t require guesswork or unnecessary
    movement.
  guide: >-
    We understand that every shipment or bench hour risks budget and reputation.
    Our computer-vision pre-screen is trained on thousands of annotated images
    with conservator input to give clear, actionable signals from the photos you
    already have.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload images or share a link. 2) AI checks image quality and flags
    visible issues (e.g., craquelure, abrasions, edge wear, warping, stains,
    repairs). 3) Receive a concise report with annotated flags and a shot list
    for better photos or green-light to proceed.
  callToAction: Start a free test upload or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Fewer wasted shipments, faster decisions, fewer conservation surprises,
    documented due diligence, protected margins, and stronger client confidence.
  failure: >-
    Hidden defects discovered late, unnecessary travel and bench time,
    preventable returns, reputational damage, and avoidable risk to artworks.
