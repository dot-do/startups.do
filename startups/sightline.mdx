  problem:
    - >-
      Photo-based FNOLs lack consistent quality, causing rework, manual review,
      and delays (20–40% of photo claims require follow-up photo requests
      today).
    - >-
      Adjusters spend 8–20 minutes per claim on initial photo review and
      routing, adding $6–$15 LAE per claim without improving outcomes.
    - >-
      Early triage misses preventable total losses and fraud indicators, driving
      higher severity and leakage (1–3% avoidable severity on PD/Property).
    - >-
      Vendors focus on full estimating; carriers need reliable triage, tamper
      detection, and routing across auto and property, integrated into existing
      workflows (Guidewire, Duck Creek).
    - >-
      Regulators and internal governance require explainability and audit
      trails; current AI tools are opaque and hard to defend in market conduct
      exams.
    - >-
      Current processes bottleneck cycle time by 1–3 days from FNOL to
      assignment, hurting NPS and rental days in auto and elongating
      ALE/mitigation in property.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI photo pipeline: quality checks, guidance prompts, and automated
      classification of damage type and severity across auto and property.
    - >-
      Probability models: total loss likelihood (auto), major vs minor
      structural risk (property), and repair vs replace indicators to drive
      routing.
    - >-
      Media forensics: device attestation, metadata analysis, and
      tamper/deepfake detection to flag manipulated or reused images
      pre-adjudication.
    - >-
      Workflow routing: configurable rules to assign to virtual desk,
      DRP/contractor, field adjuster, or fast-track settlement; integrates with
      Guidewire/Duck Creek/Snapsheet.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review for edge cases with explainable outputs and
      reason codes adjustable to carrier policies.
    - >-
      Continuous model monitoring with drift, fairness checks, and performance
      dashboards mapped to claim outcomes and cost KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut claim cycle time by 1–3 days and LAE by $5–$12 per claim by
    automatically classifying damage, estimating severity/total-loss
    probability, detecting tampering, and routing to the optimal workflow—with
    enterprise-grade explainability, auditability, and prebuilt integrations to
    major claims systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-line proprietary dataset with adjudicated outcomes plus integrated
    tamper forensics and device attestation; prebuilt enterprise connectors and

  character: >-
    Direct P&C insurance carriers (NAICS 524126)—claims, SIU, and ops leaders
    who need fast, consistent triage of photo-submitted auto and property
    losses.
  problem: >-
    Photo-heavy FNOLs overload adjusters; severity/total-loss calls are
    inconsistent; tampering goes undetected; cycle times and LAE rise; customers
    wait and NPS drops; auditability is weak.
  guide: >-
    We’re an AI claims-triage partner who understands carrier workflows and
    compliance; our computer vision and tamper-detection models are secure,
    explainable, and production-proven for auto and property.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect via API/portal and map your rules; 2) Calibrate with your
    guidelines and pilot on historical claims; 3) Go live with confidence-scored
    damage class, severity/total-loss probability, tamper flags, and recommended
    routing—human-in-the-loop optional.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute demo and launch a 30-day pilot; request the integration
    kit and pricing.
  success: >-
    Sub-minute triage, higher straight-through processing, lower LAE and
    leakage, improved fraud catch, consistent decisions, faster settlements,
    better policyholder experience, and audit-ready evidence.
  failure: >-
    Without action: growing backlogs, leakage and indemnity drift, missed
    tampering, adjuster burnout, longer settlements, customer churn, and
    regulatory scrutiny.
