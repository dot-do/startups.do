  problem:
    - >-
      Analytical instrument OEMs receive fragmented customer signals across
      tickets, field-service notes, call transcripts, forums, and instrument
      telemetry; synthesizing these into a prioritized roadmap is slow and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Product teams rely on anecdotes and HIPPOs rather than quantified impact,
      leading to misprioritized features and delayed fixes that drive repeat
      incidents and churn.
    - >-
      Support and service engineering spend significant time manually tagging
      and routing issues; taxonomies are inconsistent across products and
      regions.
    - >-
      Telemetry is underutilized: failure codes, firmware versions, MTBF/MTTR,
      and usage patterns are rarely connected to VOC, hiding systemic issues and
      upgrade opportunities.
    - >-
      Regulatory and data-privacy constraints (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, ISO/IEC
      27001, GDPR) limit the use of generic SaaS analytics; on-prem/VPC is often
      required.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop measurement: after releasing a fix/feature, impact on
      ticket volume, downtime, and NPS is hard to quantify.
    - >-
      Global footprints create blind spots (multilingual feedback,
      region-specific workflows) not captured by generic NLP models.
    - >-
      Existing tools (Jira, Productboard, spreadsheets, BI) aren’t
      instrument-domain aware (e.g., LC/GC-MS modules, detectors, pumps,
      columns, ion sources) and can’t reliably map feedback to product modules
      or regulatory claims.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion with prebuilt connectors for
      Zendesk/Salesforce/ServiceNow/Jira Service Management, Discourse/Khoros
      forums, Zoom/Teams/Gong call transcripts, and IoT/telemetry (OPC-UA, MQTT,
      vendor SDKs).
    - >-
      Instrument-domain NLP: taxonomy/ontology for LC/GC, MS, spectroscopy,
      microscopy; entity linking to modules (pump, autosampler, detector, ion
      source), methods, sample matrices, firmware versions, error codes.
    - >-
      Impact quantification and prioritization: compute Reach, Impact,
      Confidence, Effort (RICE), ICE, and WSJF; quantify ARR at risk, downtime
      hours, consumables pull-through impact, SLA penalties, regulatory
      exposure.
    - >-
      Telemetry-VOC correlation: associate error codes and firmware versions
      with ticket clusters and lab segments; detect systemic defects vs.
      configuration/training issues.
    - >-
      Backlog generation and sync: auto-create and update epics/stories with
      evidence and ROI in Jira/Azure DevOps; deduplicate and link to related
      feedback.
    - >-
      Multilingual support (major EU/Asia languages) with domain-tuned STT and
      translation; PII redaction; on-prem/VPC deployment options with audit
      trails and model explainability.
    - >-
      Closed-loop impact tracking: after release, measure change in incident
      rate, MTBF, time-to-resolution, NPS, and feature adoption; auto-generate
      release impact reports.
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: role-based access, eDiscovery, export controls
      handling, 21 CFR Part 11-aligned audit logs, SOC 2/ISO 27001 posture.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every ticket, call, forum post, and telemetry ping into a prioritized,
    ROI-quantified backlog tied to instrument modules—compliant, multilingual,
    and built for analytical OEMs. Reduce misprioritization, cut repeat
    incidents, and prove impact of releases.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary instrument-domain ontology and cross-OEM labeled dataset mapping
    VOC and telemetry to specific modules and error codes; privacy-preserving
    benchmarks and federated learning across customers; validated regulatory
    controls (21 CFR Part 11-aligned audit trails) and VPC/on-prem deployment
    patterns uncommon in horizontal VOC tools.
  customerSegments:

  problem:
    - 'Customer feedback is scattered across tickets, call notes, and forums.'
    - Telemetry signals issues long before support sees them.
    - 'Prioritization favors the loudest voice, not the biggest impact.'
