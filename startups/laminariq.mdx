leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ response times are slow (often 8–48 hours) due to manual parsing of
      emails/PDFs, tribal knowledge, and fragmented data across
      ERP/CRM/LIMS/MES.
    - >-
      Cost models are inconsistent; resin volatility and changeovers make quotes
      inaccurate, causing margin leakage or lost orders.
    - >-
      Sales teams rely on spreadsheets and email threads; approvals are ad hoc
      and undocumented, creating compliance and audit risks.
    - >-
      COAs are created manually post-run; copying data from LIMS to templates
      leads to errors, delays, and rework (holds shipments and cash).
    - >-
      Customer-specific specs (ASTM tests, tolerances, brand-owner templates)
      are hard to apply consistently; COA nonconformance triggers
      penalties/chargebacks.
    - >-
      Quality and lab resources are overburdened; shortage of skilled
      estimators/quality staff increases cycle times and risk.
    - >-
      Limited feedback loop between quoting assumptions (speed, scrap, OEE) and
      actual run data; no continuous improvement to quote accuracy.
    - >-
      Resin index updates (ICIS/IHS) and energy surcharges are not
      systematically applied, undermining margins.
    - >-
      Customers demand digital COAs/eCOAs, traceability, and faster
      confirmations; current processes inhibit differentiation and retention.
    - >-
      Multi-plant organizations lack standardized quoting and COA processes;
      results vary by site and individual.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted RFQ intake: ingest email/PDF/Excel/portal requests, extract
      specs, volumes, delivery, and commercial terms.
    - >-
      Specification mapping: translate customer specs to internal tests (e.g.,
      gauge tolerance, COF, MD/TD tensile/elongation, haze, OTR/WVTR) and match
      to capabilities.
    - >-
      Costing engine: simulate resin usage, masterbatch, adhesive, line speed,
      scrap, energy, labor, overhead, changeovers, and slitting; pull current
      resin/energy indices.
    - >-
      Price optimization: generate multiple scenarios (cost+, target margin,
      price floors, surcharges), compare against historical wins and capacity
      constraints.
    - >-
      Workflow + output: automated approvals, version control, branded quote
      PDFs/emails/API back to customer portals; sync to CRM/ERP.
    - >-
      COA automation: after run completion, pull LIMS/MES data by
      lot/roll/pallet, validate against customer spec limits, flag exceptions,
      generate COA PDFs/EDI/eCOA, and route automatically.
    - >-
      Feedback loop: compare quoted assumptions vs actual run (speed, scrap,
      resin usage) to continually tune cost models and update standard
      times/rates.
    - >-
      Analytics: track quote cycle time, win rate, realized margins, COA on-time
      rate, and exception causes.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors for SAP, Oracle, Plex, DELMIAworks, Epicor,
      Infor, D365; LabWare, LabVantage, STARLIMS; EDI/eCOA to customer portals.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2, SSO/SAML, audit trails; prebuilt templates for
      major brand-owner COA requirements and BRCGS/ISO 9001 documentation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quote complex film/laminate jobs in minutes and deliver compliant COAs
    automatically after production—improving win rate, protecting margins, and
    freeing sales and quality teams from manual work.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A film/lamination-specific costing engine and COA automation trained on
    industry data, plus prebuilt integrations to the most common ERPs and LIMS
    used in NAICS 326112. Library of validated brand-owner COA templates and
    ASTM mappings reduces time-to-value. Continuous learning loop from actual
    run data improves quote accuracy—hard for generic CPQ/LIMS to replicate.
    Network effects from anonymized benchmarks help customers optimize margins
    and throughput.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, estimating, and quality leaders at plastics packaging film and
    sheet manufacturers who need faster accurate quotes and compliant COAs.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs are slow and manual, costing is inconsistent, and COAs are
    built by hand from LIMS and ERP data. Internal: Teams feel pressure to
    respond faster without risking margin or compliance. Philosophical:
    Manufacturers should win work and ship confidently without drowning in
    spreadsheets.
  guide: >-
    We understand film and sheet operations and the stakes of GMP, ISO, and
    customer specs. Our AI is built for plastics costing and COA rules, modeling
    resin, gauge, layers, line speeds, scrap, and test specs, and integrates
    with common LIMS and ERP systems.
  plan: >-
    1) Discovery and data mapping. 2) Connect LIMS and ERP, configure costing
    rules, and validate on sample RFQs and runs. 3) Go live with quoting and COA
    automation, including training and KPI tracking.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute demo and data fit assessment.
  success: >-
    Quotes go out in minutes with consistent margin-protecting cost models, win
    rate and throughput rise, and COAs generate automatically from LIMS data,
    audit-ready and on time, reducing rework and delighting customers.
  failure: >-
    Quotes continue to lag, margin leaks, COA errors create audit findings, and
    orders are lost to faster competitors.
