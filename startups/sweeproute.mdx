  problem:
    - >-
      Manual scheduling is time-consuming: Dispatchers spend 10–20 hours/week
      building and adjusting schedules across 50–500 cleaners.
    - >-
      Inefficient routing increases costs: 15–30% of paid time is spent driving
      due to non-optimized routes and time windows.
    - >-
      Last-minute call-outs cause SLA failures: 5–10% daily absenteeism leads to
      missed cleanings, client complaints, and penalty fees.
    - >-
      Overtime and labor compliance risks: Poor balancing creates 5–12%
      unnecessary overtime and exposure to union/meal-break violations.
    - >-
      Limited real-time visibility: Supervisors lack live ETAs,
      proof-of-service, and capacity views to make on-the-fly decisions.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: Schedules live in spreadsheets; navigation, timekeeping,
      and communication are separate systems with errors.
    - >-
      Difficult bidding and capacity planning: No fast way to simulate new
      contract impact on workforce and routes.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI schedule builder: Generates shift assignments respecting time windows,
      skills, access rules, union/meal-break policies, and max hours.
    - >-
      Route optimization: Multi-objective routing (travel time, OT cost, SLA
      priority) with live traffic and building access constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time rebalancing: Auto-redistributes workloads when jobs change or
      staff call out; pushes updated routes to cleaners in <3 minutes.
    - >-
      Predictive staffing: Forecasts no-shows and late arrivals by
      location/time/day to pre-stage floaters and reduce disruption.
    - >-
      Supervisor console: Live map, ETAs, capacity heatmap, overtime
      projections; one-click reassignment with AI suggestions.
    - >-
      Cleaner mobile app: Offline-first routes, turn-by-turn nav, QR/geo
      check-in/out, task lists, photo/issue logging, multi-language.
    - >-
      Client comms and SLAs: Automated arrival alerts, service confirmations,
      and exception handling with proof-of-service.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: Simulate new contracts, time window shifts, or staffing
      changes; compare cost/SLA outcomes before committing.
    - >-
      Integrations: Two-way sync with CRM/work order, timekeeping/payroll, HRIS,
      telematics/GPS, and messaging (SMS/WhatsApp).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut drive time by 20–35% and overtime by 15–30% while reassigning call-out
    jobs within 3 minutes. Increase jobs per cleaner by 10–15% and raise on-time
    arrivals to 95%+ within 60 days—without adding dispatch headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A janitorial-specific optimization engine and dataset (skills, time windows,
    access rules, union/meal-break compliance) that enables <3-minute
    auto-rebalancing at scale, plus deep integrations with janitorial CRMs and
    payroll. Accumulated performance data continuously improves predictions and
    constraint tuning, creating a defensible feedback loop and switching costs.
