  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers receive vendor copy that is generic and duplicated across
      competitors, hurting organic rankings and click-through rates.
    - >-
      Small teams lack time and expertise to write unique, on-brand
      descriptions, tags, and alt-text for thousands of SKUs and frequent new
      releases/collections.
    - >-
      Product images often ship without alt-text or with poor alt-text, creating
      accessibility gaps (WCAG non-compliance) and legal risk.
    - >-
      Inconsistent tagging/taxonomy (fiber content, width, designer, collection,
      color) reduces site search/filter accuracy and conversion.
    - >-
      Manual content creation/maintenance across Shopify/WooCommerce is slow,
      error-prone, and difficult to scale for variant-level data
      (bolts/pre-cuts/pattern sizes).
    - >-
      Existing generic AI tools produce inaccurate fiber/measurement details,
      misuse sewing terminology, or hallucinate, requiring heavy editing by
      staff.
    - >-
      Retailers lack structured schema.org product data and SEO metadata,
      limiting visibility in Google Shopping/organic SERPs.
    - >-
      Multi-channel product feeds (Shopify, Etsy, Google Merchant Center) are
      inconsistent, causing disapprovals and lost traffic.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated transformation of vendor feeds (CSV/EDI/Sheets/APIs) and product
      photos into unique titles, H1s, meta descriptions, bullets, long
      descriptions, and collection summaries.
    - >-
      Computer vision extracts colorways, motifs, pattern scale, and fabric
      attributes; cross-checks against vendor specs to prevent hallucinations.
    - >-
      Brand style profile (tone, reading level, house terms, formatting) ensures
      every output matches your voice; supports multiple brands/locations.
    - >-
      Standards-based tagging: fiber content, width, weight, designer,
      collection, theme, technique, pre-cut type, SKU/UPC—mapped to store
      filters and Google product categories.
    - >-
      Alt-text generation aligned with WCAG 2.2 and accessibility best
      practices; guarantees 0% missing alt-text for in-scope images.
    - >-
      Structured data injection (schema.org/Product, Offer) and
      Shopify/WooCommerce metafields for rich results; Google Merchant Center
      feed optimization.
    - >-
      Batch processing and approvals with human-in-the-loop QA; change tracking
      and rollback; A/B testing on titles/metas.
    - >-
      Duplicate-content detection versus vendor copy and top-ranking
      competitors; automatic rewrite thresholds to ensure uniqueness.
    - >-
      Analytics: SKU coverage, SEO indexation, impressions/CTR, accessibility
      score, and conversion lift; alerts for out-of-date or missing content.
    - >-
      One-click publish to Shopify/WooCommerce; feed exporters for Etsy and
      Google; API for PIM/ERP.
    - >-
      Multilingual outputs (EN/ES/FR) for US/CA/EU markets with locale-aware
      measurement units and terminology.
    - >-
      Ongoing monitoring: broken images/alt-text gaps, missing tags, and schema
      validation with auto-fix suggestions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn vendor data and photos into accurate, on-brand, SEO- and
    accessibility-optimized product pages for fabric, quilting, and sewing
    retailers—at 10x the speed and consistent with your store’s taxonomy and
    tone.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built sewing/fabric taxonomy, measurement validators, and vendor
    integrations combined with a fine-tuned text+vision stack drastically reduce
    factual errors common in generic AI tools. Relationships with leading
    distributors enable timely, structured access to new collections and specs,
    allowing retailers to publish differentiated, on-brand content within days
    of product release. The brand style engine and tag normalizer “remember”
    each store’s voice and filters, creating consistent navigation and SEO at
    scale—difficult to replicate without niche data, partners, and process.
