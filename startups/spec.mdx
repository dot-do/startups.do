  problem:
    - >-
      Out-of-spec gradations lead to rejected loads, rework, and liquidated
      damages; many plants operate at 85–92% first-pass spec compliance with
      1–3% load rejections in DOT jobs.
    - >-
      Operators rely on heuristics and manual Excel blending; decisions are slow
      and inconsistent, especially with changing moisture/gradation in
      stockpiles.
    - >-
      Overuse of higher-cost materials (e.g., manufactured sand, washed fines)
      to “play it safe” increases $/ton by $0.10–$0.40 without improving
      quality.
    - >-
      Lag between lab sieve results and production causes drift from target FM
      and gradation envelopes (ASTM C33, AASHTO, local DOT), especially after
      weather events or pile face changes.
    - >-
      No unified, auditable system for cost-constrained optimization; OEM
      controls offer setpoint following but not spec-aware, least-cost
      optimization.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into near-term depletion of piles and the cost impact
      of current blending choices (next 1–2 weeks).
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine solves least-cost blend to meet target envelopes (ASTM
      C33/AASHTO/DOT), FM, fines/clay constraints, moisture, and feeder/plant
      limits using linear/quadratic programming with chance constraints for
      variability.
    - >-
      Digital twin of stockpiles with continuously updated gradation models from
      lab sieves, belt scales, moisture sensors, and production history.
    - >-
      Closed-loop or advisory control: outputs new feeder setpoints at 1–5
      minute intervals; optional PLC integration to auto-adjust VFDs with
      operator confirmation.
    - >-
      Cost module with per-pile cost curves (mined, processed, energy, water,
      loading) and availability to avoid depleting critical piles; forward
      look-ahead for 1–2 weeks.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit: auto-generated reports per job/shift/lot with
      envelope plots, FM trends, and audit trails mapped to project specs.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: simulate spec changes, pile depletion, or
      weather-induced moisture spikes; quantify $/ton impact before changing
      production.
    - >-
      Degradation handling: sensor health checks and fallback rule set when data
      are missing; alerts when predicted vs. measured gradations diverge beyond
      tolerance.
    - >-
      Rapid deployment: connectors for common LIMS/QC tools, belt scales, PLCs
      (Rockwell/Siemens), and moisture sensors; typical go-live 4–8 weeks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit spec every shift at the lowest possible cost. Real-time, audit-ready
    optimization that blends multiple feeder/piles to meet ASTM/DOT gradation
    envelopes and FM targets while minimizing $/ton—integrated with your lab,
    scales, and PLCs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Accumulating, plant-specific and cross-plant dataset linking stochastic
    gradation behavior to least-cost settings, enabling faster convergence and
    higher-confidence optimization than rule-based or static tools; deep
    integrations into PLC/SCADA and QC workflows plus audit-ready spec libraries
    create switching costs and defensibility.

    - >-
      Regional and national aggregate producers with multi-feeder plants (3–8
      feeders) selling to ready-mix, asphalt, and DOT projects.

  character: >-
    Plant, quarry, and QC managers at construction sand & gravel operations
    (NAICS 212321) who must deliver spec‑compliant aggregates at the lowest
    cost.
  problem: >-
    External: Variable feed gradations, moisture, and wear make manual blending
    guesswork—driving spec drift and cost creep. Internal: Constantly chasing
    envelopes, overusing premium fines to be “safe,” burning time on
    spreadsheets and rework. Philosophical: Meeting ASTM/DOT gradations
    shouldn’t require guesswork or sacrifice margins.
  guide: >-
    We understand the daily pressure to hit ASTM C33/DOT envelopes while
    protecting uptime and margins. Built by aggregate process engineers and data
    scientists, our AI recommends optimal feeder/pile blend percentages to meet
    target gradation envelopes at minimum cost—with real‑time feedback, audit
    trails, and setpoint guidance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import sieve data (lab/online), pile inventories, moisture, and
    material costs. 2) Configure: Set target envelopes, constraints, and
    cost/penalty weights. 3) Optimize & run: Get feeder setpoints, monitor
    compliance via dashboard/API, and iterate through a low‑risk pilot before
    full rollout.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo and schedule a plant pilot. Transitional:
    Request a free blend‑cost baseline and sample compliance report.
  success: >-
    Consistent ASTM/DOT compliance, lower $/ton, fewer rejected loads, less
    rework, stabilized feeder settings, confident QC sign‑offs, faster bids,
    higher plant utilization, and traceable compliance for audits.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting—over‑spec mixes, wasted premium material, rejected
    loads, penalties, missed margins, production slowdowns, and dissatisfied
    customers.
