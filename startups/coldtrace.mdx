  problem:
    - >-
      Temperature excursions in meat distribution cause 0.15–0.35% revenue
      shrink (assumption based on industry QA interviews), yet many loads have
      only basic high/low alarms and lack root-cause context.
    - >-
      Claims and chargebacks are slow, contentious, and under-documented;
      assembling evidence from reefer downloads, route logs, and receiver probes
      takes 2–5 hours per disputed load and 10–15 days cycle time.
    - >-
      Generic telematics alerting produces noise (false positives from door
      openings/defrost cycles), leading to alert fatigue and missed real
      incidents.
    - >-
      Commodity-specific spoilage risk is not modeled; time–temperature exposure
      is treated uniformly across beef, pork, and poultry despite different
      microbial growth kinetics and packaging factors.
    - >-
      FSMA Sanitary Transportation Rule and customer audit requirements create
      administrative burden; paper and ad-hoc digital logs are incomplete or
      noncompliant.
    - >-
      Wholesalers lack standardized, insurer-accepted “claim-ready” evidence
      formats, reducing recovery rates and increasing write-offs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate telematics and sensor data (reefer controller, door, ambient,
      probe, route/ETA) across fleets, carriers, and data logger vendors into
      one timeline per load.
    - >-
      Detect excursions with context-aware anomaly models that distinguish
      normal defrost/door events from risk-bearing temperature abuse.
    - >-
      Predict spoilage risk and residual shelf-life using commodity-specific
      time–temperature models (beef, pork, poultry) and packaging/kill-step
      metadata.
    - >-
      Auto-generate claim-ready evidence packets (graphs, thresholds, corrective
      actions, custody chain, calibration records) mapped to insurer and
      customer formats to accelerate adjudication.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts with prescriptive advice (pre-cool verification, setpoint
      corrections, divert options, icing/restack guidance) to mitigate loss
      in-transit.
    - >-
      One-click FSMA-compliant logs and audit trails integrated to QA systems
      and customer portals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce temperature-related shrink and chargebacks by 20–40% while cutting
    claims cycle time to under 48 hours, via AI that turns mixed reefer/sensor
    telemetry into predictive spoilage risk scores and insurer-accepted,
    claim-ready evidence packets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Commodity-specific risk models tuned for meat with validated outcomes and
    insurer-endorsed evidence formats, combined with the broadest integrations
    across reefer OEMs, telematics, and loggers—creating switching costs via
    historical performance baselines and accepted claims workflows.

  character: >-
    Cold-chain and operations leaders at meat and meat product merchant
    wholesalers who must keep product safe, compliant, and profitable from plant
    to customer.
  problem: >-
    Temperature excursions and data gaps cause spoilage, rejected loads, and
    disputes; teams lack real-time visibility and defensible proof; it shouldn’t
    be hard to guarantee cold-chain integrity and get paid for delivered
    quality.
  guide: >-
    We understand the stakes of perishable logistics. Our AI aggregates reefer
    and sensor telemetry to detect anomalies, predict spoilage risk, and
    auto-assemble claim-ready evidence with secure audit trails and easy
    integrations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect reefer, ELD, and sensor feeds; 2) Configure lane thresholds,
    alerts, and roles; 3) Monitor live risk scores, intervene early, and use
    auto-generated evidence packets for customers, auditors, and claims.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a demo and start a 30-day pilot on priority lanes; download a
    sample evidence packet and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Fewer losses and rejections, faster claims with defensible proof,
    always-ready compliance documentation, higher on-time acceptance, and
    stronger customer trust and margins.
  failure: >-
    Without it, excursions go unseen, spoilage and chargebacks rise, audits
    drain time, premiums climb, and key accounts erode.

  problem:
    - >-
      Temperature excursions go unseen between stops, driving shrink and
      rejected loads.
    - >-
      Telemetry is fragmented across reefers, loggers, and telematics—no single
      source of truth.
    - Threshold alerts are noisy; teams miss the critical few that matter.
    - 'Claims stall without clean, time-stamped evidence and custody history.'
    - 'Audits require complete, traceable temperature records across the journey.'
    - >-
      Multi-stop dwell and door openings cause warming that’s hard to triage in
      real time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify reefer and sensor data into a single cold-chain timeline per
      shipment and asset.
    - >-
      AI detects abnormal patterns, predicts spoilage risk, and prioritizes
      actions by impact.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts with severity, root cause hints, and time-to-risk
      forecasts.
    - >-
      Auto-build claim-ready evidence packets with charts, events, custody, and

      actions, and PDF/CSV export.
    - 'Tamper-evident evidence: timestamps, device IDs, and hash verification.'
    - >-
      Compliance automation: configurable thresholds, HACCP logs, and audit
      trails.

    - Invite Ops/QA users and set alert routing and escalation policies.
    - >-
      Start monitoring live shipments—act on prioritized anomalies and
      forecasts.
    - Export claim-ready packets to resolve disputes and recover value faster.
    - Review scorecards and trends; refine rules to reduce future excursions.
