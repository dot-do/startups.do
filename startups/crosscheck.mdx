    discrepancies before release.
  targetUsers:
    - Design engineering
    - Document control
    - Quality
  triggers:
    - ECO raised or drawing moved to review
    - BOM revision change

  problem:
    - >-
      Drawing-to-BOM mismatches, missing cert links (e.g., MTRs), and revision
      conflicts cause NCRs, rework, and shipment delays; typical rework cost per
      affected job: $3,000–$25,000 and 3–10 days schedule slip.
    - >-
      Manual checks are time-consuming (30–90 minutes per package) and
      inconsistent across teams, especially with multi-site operations and
      contract designers.
    - >-
      Traceability and compliance risks under API Spec Q1 and product-specific
      standards (e.g., API 6A, 7-1, 16A, ASME) are high when certs are not
      correctly matched to parts, heat numbers, and revisions.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across CAD/PDM/PLM, ERP/MRP, and QMS creates version
      drift and stale references; common root cause for late-stage ECOs.
    - >-
      Engineering release bottlenecks: high WIP queue and late-stage defects
      lead to 20–40% of ECOs driven by documentation inconsistencies, inflating
      lead times.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and parse engineering packages from PDM/PLM (e.g., SolidWorks PDM,
      Vault, Teamcenter, Windchill) and ERP/MRP (SAP, Oracle EBS, IFS, Infor,
      Epicor).
    - >-
      Computer vision + OCR + NLP to extract title blocks, notes, revision
      blocks, BOM tables, material specs, coatings, tolerances, and callouts
      from 2D PDFs and 3D-derived drawings.
    - >-
      Cross-system reconciliation: validate drawing part numbers vs ERP items,
      revision parity, approved vendor status, and unit of measure consistency.
    - >-
      Certificate matching: auto-link MTRs/WPS/PQR/NDE reports to BOM line items
      by material grade, heat/lot, spec (e.g., API 6A PSL level), and revision;
      flag gaps and expirations.
    - >-
      Rule engine with prebuilt oilfield rule packs (API 6A, 7-1, 16A, ASME
      B31.3, NACE MR0175/ISO 15156) and company-specific standards; configurable
      severity and gating.
    - >-
      Automated redlines and discrepancy reports with risk scoring; push
      findings to engineering change workflows (ECO/ECR) with e-signatures.
    - >-
      Release gating and audit trails: block release in PDM/PLM until critical
      discrepancies are resolved; generate compliance dossier for API Q1 audits.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-premises (air-gapped) or private cloud (SOC 2 Type
      II), SSO, RBAC, detailed logging; APIs and web UI review station.
    - >-
      Performance analytics dashboard: trend ECO drivers, first-pass yield,
      cycle time per site, and rule hit heatmaps.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native, oilfield-specific drawing and BOM consistency checker that
    integrates with existing CAD/PLM/ERP and QMS to catch 95%+ of common
    discrepancies pre-release, reduce ECOs 25–40%, cut release cycle time
    30–50%, and produce audit-ready evidence for API/ASME compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned AI models and rule packs for API/ASME/NACE with a proprietary
    labeled dataset and certified connectors to the dominant PLM/ERP systems in
    oilfield manufacturing, enabling high precision/recall and audit-grade
    traceability that horizontal document AI or generic PLM checkers cannot
    match. On-prem, air-gapped deployment capability further differentiates for
    sensitive facilities.

    Engineering, Quality, and Document Control leaders at Oil & Gas field
    machinery and equipment manufacturers (NAICS 333132) who want every release
    to be first-time-right, compliant, and on schedule.
  problem: >-
    Manual, error-prone checks leave discrepancies between drawings, BOMs,
    revisions, and certs undetected—causing rework, NCRs, delays, and audit risk
    in API/ASME-regulated builds.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of late ECOs, vendor cert variations, and tight
    ship dates. Our domain-trained AI and workflows are built for API/ASME/ISO
    9001 quality systems and integrate with your PDM/PLM and ERP.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your PDM/PLM/ERP and file stores and define rules. 2) Run
    automated cross-checks to surface mismatches with evidence links. 3) Resolve
    findings and release with an auto-generated QA report and audit trail.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a focused 2-week pilot on one product line.
  success: >-
    Fewer release defects and FAT surprises, shorter cycles, audit-ready
    traceability, protected margins, and on-time, compliant shipments.
  failure: >-
    Discrepancies escape to the shop floor or customer, driving rework, missed
    ship dates, NCRs, cost overruns, and painful audits that erode trust.
