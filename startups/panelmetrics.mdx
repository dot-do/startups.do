  problem:
    - >-
      Manual precast panel takeoffs and embed/lifter schedules are slow (8–20
      hours per 100-panel drawing set) and error-prone (2–5% typical variance),
      impacting bid accuracy and margins.
    - >-
      Revisions and addenda require rework; estimators re-do counts and
      schedules 2–3 times per project, adding 20–40% effort and delaying bid
      submissions.
    - >-
      Embeds/lifters rely on fragmented vendor catalogs and spreadsheets; lack
      of standardization leads to misplacement and field rework ($5k–$50k per
      incident).
    - >-
      Current tools (Bluebeam/Excel or fully modeling in Revit/Tekla) are either
      manual or overkill; teams need rapid, auditable outputs without building
      full BIM models.
    - >-
      Limited estimator bandwidth creates bid backlog and lost opportunities;
      firms leave 5–15% of RFPs unbid due to time constraints.
    - >-
      Traceability is weak; GCs and owners increasingly demand transparent
      quantities and change histories, which manual workflows lack.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven parsing of PDFs, DWGs, and IFCs to detect panel boundaries,
      thickness, edges, reveals, joints, and openings; outputs panel counts,
      areas, weights, and perimeter by type.
    - >-
      Automated hardware selection: lifters and embeds chosen via rule engine
      using panel weight, rigging geometry, and vendor charts
      (Leviat/Halfen/Meadow Burke, Dayton Superior, JVI); configurable safety
      factors and local practices.
    - >-
      Embed/lifter scheduling: panel-by-panel bill with coordinates (X/Y from a
      user-defined datum), part numbers, quantities, and edge distances; export
      to Excel/CSV and instantiate as objects in Revit/Tekla via plugins.
    - >-
      Revision compare: diff quantities and schedules between plan versions;
      generate an auditable change log with rationale and deltas.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: side-by-side review, confidence highlights, and
      one-click corrections that retrain the model over time; approval workflow
      with stamped PDFs of the schedule package.
    - >-
      Integration APIs: push/pull to Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, and
      Bluebeam; attach schedule to submittals and RFIs.
    - >-
      Guardrails: engineering checks for minimum edge distances, lifter angles,
      panel weight sanity checks; warnings when inputs exceed catalog limits;
      not a sealed design (optional partner PE review available).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, auditable precast panel takeoffs and embed/lifter schedules from
    2D/3D drawings—with >95% detection accuracy, vendor-catalog-driven hardware
    selection, and seamless exports to Excel, Revit, and Tekla—so contractors
    bid more work with higher confidence and fewer field issues.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A precast-specific model and ruleset trained on a growing, proprietary
    dataset of annotated panel drawings and schedules, combined with
    vendor-catalog partnerships and deep Revit/Tekla integrations that create a
    closed-loop feedback system and high switching costs.

    and BIM and turn geometry and hardware into clean quantities and schedules
    with traceability. A reliable partner for teams who value speed, accuracy,
    and repeatability.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload drawings or models. 2) AI extracts panels, openings, embeds, and
    lifters with clickable highlights and audit trail. 3) Review and approve in
    browser, track revisions. 4) Export panel counts/areas and embed/lifter
    schedules to Excel/CSV/ERP.
  callToAction: Start a free pilot on your next bid or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Bid faster with confidence. Produce accurate panel counts and areas plus a
    complete embed/lifter schedule in minutes. Cut RFIs and rework, improve
    coordination, protect margins, and win more work.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning hours on manual takeoffs, miss critical hardware, trigger
    change orders and schedule slips, and lose bids to faster, more accurate
    competitors.
