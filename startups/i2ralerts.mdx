leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatch and operations log incidents in free-text radio, CAD/AVL notes,
      and spreadsheets that are slow to translate into clear rider alerts.
    - >-
      Median time from incident to published rider alert in mid-sized agencies
      is 8–20 minutes; riders demand <2 minutes for major disruptions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent, manual messaging leads to errors (wrong route/direction,
      vague duration) and compliance gaps (e.g., accessibility language, Title
      VI translations).
    - >-
      Agencies lack a unified workflow to push accurate alerts across all
      channels (GTFS-rt, apps, web, SMS, email, signs, social) with a single
      approval step.
    - >-
      Call centers and social teams are overwhelmed during disruption spikes;
      manual processes don’t scale, increasing costs and complaints.
    - >-
      Existing tools in CAD/AVL or GTFS editors were not built for radio
      transcripts or incident logs; they lack NLP, deduplication, and
      route-alternative generation.
    - >-
      Leadership needs defensible metrics (time-to-alert, accuracy, reach) to
      meet customer experience goals but cannot measure them reliably today.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven ingestion of radio audio/transcripts, CAD/AVL incident notes,
      and dispatcher forms; converts to structured events (route, direction,
      location, severity, expected duration).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop console that auto-drafts alerts with plain language,
      accessibility-first phrasing, and multi-language variants; single-click
      publish across all channels.
    - >-
      Automatic GTFS-rt Service Alerts generation, plus formatting for web
      widget, SMS, email, social, IVR, and digital signage.
    - >-
      Alternative trip suggestions: dynamic detour text, stop-level guidance,
      and suggested connections based on GTFS/GTFS-rt, headways, and road
      closures.
    - >-
      Policy and template engine: agency-approved tone, required fields, and
      ADA/Title VI compliance checks before publish.
    - >-
      Event deduplication and correlation (e.g., multiple reports to one
      blockage), severity prioritization, and escalation workflows.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard tracking time-to-alert, accuracy, reach, edits before
      publish, and impact on call volume and rider satisfaction.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn internal incidents and radio logs into accurate, multi-channel rider
    alerts and alternatives in under 2 minutes, with human approval, measurable
    accuracy, and compliance built in.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-agency corpus of incident-to-alert mappings and outcomes
    that continuously improves NLP accuracy and alternative recommendations;
    deep integrations with major CAD/AVL and signage vendors plus a
    human-in-the-loop workflow and compliance templates purpose-built for
    transit communications.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Transit operations and communications teams who need to quickly turn
    internal incident chatter into clear, rider-facing updates and options.
  problem: >-
    Disruptions happen, but manual, channel-by-channel alerting from radio logs
    and incident notes is slow and inconsistent—creating confusion, call-center
    spikes, operator distraction, and eroded rider trust.
  guide: >-
    Built by transit and AI practitioners, we understand disruption fire drills.
    Our human-in-the-loop platform integrates with CAD/AVL, radio logs, and
    incident systems to draft accurate, accessible alerts and
    alternatives—proven to cut time-to-alert while keeping staff in control.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect incident feeds and set policies/templates. 2) AI drafts
    multi-channel alerts and rider alternatives; staff reviews and approves. 3)
    Publish everywhere at once, monitor performance, and refine with analytics.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 30-day pilot.
  success: >-
    Riders get timely, accurate, accessible alerts with actionable alternatives
    across SMS, app, web, email, PA, and social. Agencies reduce time-to-alert,
    complaints, and call volume; maintain brand voice; meet ADA/508 and policy
    standards; and gain a complete audit trail.
  failure: >-
    Without this, alerts lag or contradict each other, misinformation spreads,
    staff is overwhelmed, social media blowups escalate, compliance risks grow,
    and rider trust declines.
