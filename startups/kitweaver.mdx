leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual kit creation is slow and error‑prone: typical quilt/sewing shops
      spend 2–6 hours per kit (parsing yardage, finding substitutions, pricing,
      and creating listings), limiting kit throughput and tying up senior staff.
    - >-
      Pattern instructions vary widely (yards, meters, FQs, pre‑cuts, 1-1/4 yd
      formatting, color names, DMC/Anchor floss codes), causing frequent
      misreads, unit conversion mistakes, and over/under-cutting.
    - >-
      Mapping pattern requirements to in‑stock SKUs is tedious: synonyms, color
      families, bolt widths (WOF), pre‑cuts, needle sizes, and fabric counts
      (e.g., 14ct Aida vs 32ct linen) require domain expertise.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware bundling is hard with generic POS/ecom tools: bundles
      oversell when a single component runs out; dynamic availability and
      substitutions are not automated.
    - >-
      Pricing and margin control for kits is inconsistent: misses on shrinkage,
      offcuts, and minimum cut increments reduce realized margin by 3–8 pp.
    - >-
      Ongoing maintenance is heavy: as SKUs change, kits break or go out of
      stock; most shops do not update kits, leading to lost sales and customer
      frustration.
    - >-
      Compliance with pattern licensing is unclear: whether a pattern must be
      included in kit price (paper vs digital), or linked as a required add‑on,
      varies by publisher.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest pattern via PDF upload, photo, or URL; OCR/NLP parses yardage,
      pre‑cuts, notions, sizes/options, and needlework floss/fabric counts.
    - >-
      Normalize quantities and units (yards/meters, fractions, FQs, jelly rolls,
      charm packs, fat eighths; DMC→Anchor conversion; Aida/linen counts; needle
      sizes).
    - >-
      Map requirements to the retailer’s catalog using fuzzy match and a
      vertical ontology (color families, substrates, brand lines, pattern scale)
      with configurable substitution rules and vendor lead‑time awareness.
    - >-
      Compute BOM with waste/shrinkage, minimum cut increments, WOF/usable
      width, rounding, and optional size/version selection; validate stock and
      propose substitutions where needed.
    - >-
      Auto‑price the kit based on target margins, component markups, competitor
      benchmarks, and pattern license rules; generate SEO‑ready product
      title/description/photos (optional colorway mockups).
    - >-
      Create a bundled product in POS/ecommerce (Shopify, Lightspeed, Square,
      Woo), reserve/allocate inventory, and keep availability in sync as stock
      changes.
    - >-
      Generate pack lists, cut tickets, barcode labels, and printable inserts;
      push tasks to staff queue; track actual vs planned yield and margin.
    - >-
      Monitor kit performance, recommend re‑kitting or substitutions as SKUs
      change, and trigger auto‑rebuilds or purchase orders when thresholds are
      hit.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any sewing/quilting/needlework pattern into a purchasable,
    inventory‑aware kit in under 5 minutes—reducing labor by 80%+, increasing
    kit throughput 3–5x, and maintaining real‑time stock sync and margins
    automatically.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain‑specific ontology and SKU mapping graph built from thousands of
    real patterns and retailer catalogs, combined with deep POS/ecommerce
    integrations and publisher/distributor relationships—making accurate
    auto‑kitting and dynamic inventory‑aware bundles difficult to replicate.
