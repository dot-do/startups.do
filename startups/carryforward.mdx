leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Tax professionals spend 15–30 minutes per return re-keying prior-year data
      (taxpayer info, dependents, banking, carryovers), creating a busy-season
      bottleneck.
    - >-
      Organizer completion rates are low (often <50%) because clients must
      re-enter information that hasn’t changed year to year.
    - >-
      Manual transcription of carryovers (capital loss, NOLs, AMT credit,
      passive loss, foreign tax credit) causes costly errors and review cycles.
    - >-
      Prior-year returns arrive in mixed formats (scanned PDFs, native printouts
      from Lacerte/UltraTax/CCH/Drake), adding complexity and inconsistency.
    - >-
      Staffing constraints during peak season amplify the impact of rework and
      QA, causing overtime and delayed delivery.
    - >-
      Firms lack a standardized, secure method to push structured prior-year
      data into organizers and tax software across multiple vendors.
    - >-
      Compliance and data security requirements (FTC Safeguards Rule/GLBA, SOC 2
      expectations) make homegrown parsing tools risky and expensive to
      maintain.
  solution:
    - >-
      Accept prior-year returns in any format (native software printouts or
      scanned PDFs) and automatically identify the software/source to optimize
      parsing.
    - >-
      Extract structured data for personal info, dependents, bank/refund info,
      filing history, and all key carryover schedules (e.g., Schedule D capital
      loss carryovers, passive activity carryovers, AMT credit, foreign tax
      credit, NOLs).
    - >-
      Map extracted data to organizer questionnaires and directly to tax
      software carryover fields via pre-built connectors or standardized
      JSON/CSV exports.
    - >-
      Provide confidence scores, side-by-side previews, and automated anomaly
      flags (e.g., prior-year dependent not present; unusually large carryover
      changes).
    - >-
      Enable one-click client organizer pre-fill (taxpayer/ spouse/dependents,
      prior addresses, K-1 sources, rental properties, charities, state/local
      details) with “confirm or edit” prompts to increase client completion
      rates.
    - >-
      Offer a review queue and audit trail for staff, capturing edits to
      continuously improve models via human-in-the-loop learning.
    - >-
      Deliver secure, compliant operations (SOC 2 Type II, encryption at rest/in
      transit, granular retention controls) with APIs and SSO for enterprise
      workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automatically extract, validate, and map prior-year return data to pre-fill
    client organizers and current-year carryovers—cutting intake time by 60–80%,
    boosting organizer completion by 15–30 percentage points, and delivering
    >99% field-level accuracy with enterprise-grade security and cross-vendor
    integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-vendor prior-year parsing coverage with proprietary mapping of
    carryover logic, reinforced by a human-in-the-loop correction loop that
    continuously improves accuracy; deep integrations into both organizers and
    tax suites create workflow lock-in. Security certifications and
    zero-retention/private-cloud options meet large-firm requirements that
    generic OCR tools cannot.
