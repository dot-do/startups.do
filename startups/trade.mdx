  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers lose 20–40% of potential trade-in leads after-hours or when staff
      are busy; customers expect instant quotes but receive callbacks hours/days
      later.
    - >-
      Appraisal quality is inconsistent across sales staff; variance of ±15–25%
      vs ACV causes margin erosion or lost deals.
    - >-
      Manual intake (VIN capture, photo requests) creates friction; <50% of
      customers complete photo submission when not guided.
    - >-
      Used values in powersports are opaque vs autos; market comps change
      seasonally/regionally, making desk appraisals slow and risky.
    - >-
      BDC teams waste time on unqualified or out-of-market leads; low show rates
      for appointments <40%.
    - >-
      Compliance risk (TCPA/SMS consent, PII/photos) is high; most dealers lack
      tooling for consent capture and redaction.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel bot (web widget, SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, QR
      in-store) that captures VIN, mileage/hours, and 6–12 guided photos with
      real-time feedback.
    - >-
      VIN decoding for motorcycles/ATVs with fallback make/model trim detection
      via OCR and image recognition; NHTSA/DataOne/VINData integrations.
    - >-
      Computer vision condition grading (tire/brake wear, body damage, mods,
      aftermarket parts) with defect tagging and confidence scores.
    - >-
      Market-driven valuation: blends JD Power/NADA/Black Book Powersports
      values with local comps (e.g., CycleTrader/ATVTrader) to produce a
      trade-in range with confidence and seasonality adjustment.
    - >-
      Automated appointment booking with geofencing and calendar sync
      (Google/Microsoft); reminders and reschedule flows to maximize show rate.
    - >-
      CRM/DMS push (Lightspeed EVO, DX1, Dealerspike CRM, CDK) with lead source,
      photos, transcript, and valuation details.
    - >-
      Fraud/quality controls: odometer OCR, plate/face redaction, duplicate
      device detection, location checks, and tamper detection.
    - >-
      Dealer-configurable floors/spreads: set minimums, aging-based boosts, and
      instant-approve rules for target stock units.
    - >-
      Bilingual (EN/ES) and after-hours routing to human when necessary; full
      TCPA consent capture and audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn a VIN and photos into a trusted trade-in range and a booked inspection
    in under 3 minutes—24/7—boosting lead-to-appointment and protecting gross
    with data-driven, consistent appraisals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from dealer outcomes (final ACV, recon cost,
    days-to-sale, actual sale price) tied to rich photo/condition labels,
    yielding a proprietary dataset and models tuned to powersports segments and
    local markets. Integrations and workflow depth with powersports-specific
    DMS/CRMs further raise switching costs.

    inspection; your team finalizes the offer. Agreement: Not a binding offer
    until inspection; no obligation; data handled securely.

    higher close rates, increased trade acquisition, and a smoother customer
    experience with less salesperson time.
