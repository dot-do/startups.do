  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, subjective visual checks for size, shape, color/gloss, and surface
      defects lead to inconsistent decisions and missed drift, especially across
      shifts and plants.
    - >-
      Benchtop color/gloss instruments are slow, require skilled operators, and
      don’t scale to per-piece inspection; they also struggle with
      translucent/irregular surfaces (e.g., gummies).
    - >-
      Inline vision systems are high CapEx ($150k–$400k per line), rigid to SKU
      changeovers, and often overkill for plants that rely on periodic sampling.
    - >-
      SPC and audit documentation are labor-intensive (Excel, paper logs) and
      lack traceability to actual images, making BRCGS/SQF audits stressful.
    - >-
      Frequent SKU changeovers (shape, color, coatings) increase the risk of
      out-of-spec lots and rework/scrap.
    - >-
      Training new operators for visual quality is slow; know‑how is tribal and
      not standardized across lines/sites.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile/web app to capture and upload images of sampled pieces using a
      calibration mat and lightbox; automatic per-piece analysis and pass/fail
      vs spec.
    - >-
      Calibration kit (food-safe mat with scale + color patches, optional
      foldable 5000K lightbox) to normalize size/color/gloss across devices and
      sites.
    - >-
      SKU setup wizard with confection-specific spec templates (e.g., gummy
      length/width/thickness tolerances, panned gloss ranges, color ΔE vs
      master).
    - >-
      Model training per SKU: fine-tuned defect classifiers (e.g., bubbles,
      cracks, sugar bloom, misshapes) and geometric/color/gloss measurement
      models.
    - >-
      Real-time SPC and dashboards (Cp/Cpk/Ppk, trend charts, heatmaps by
      line/shift); auto alerts to supervisors when drift or defects exceed
      control limits.
    - >-
      Integrations: CSV/S3 export, API to QMS/MES/ERP (e.g., InfinityQS, SAP
      QM), single sign-on, audit trails with image evidence.
    - >-
      Guided SOPs: operator checklist, sampling cadence reminders, auto-enforced
      minimum sample size, multi-language UI.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready reporting mapped to SQF/BRCGS clauses; lot-based
      traceability and e-signatures.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    QA/QC managers and production leads at nonchocolate confectionery plants who
    need fast, objective checks on gummies, jellies, panned mints, and chews.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual visual checks miss size/shape/color-gloss and defect
    issues. Internal: Teams worry about inconsistent batches, rework, and
    chargebacks. Philosophical: Quality shouldn’t depend on tired eyes—it should
    be data-driven and fair.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit tight specs at high speed. Our team blends
    confectionery process know‑how with computer vision expertise; models
    trained on starch‑mogul gummies and panned mints; secure, compliant, and
    production‑tested.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload sample-tray photos from the line or lab. 2) AI measures size,
    shape, color/gloss and flags defects/out‑of‑spec. 3) Receive instant
    pass/fail, spec deltas, and trends; export via CSV/API. 4) Start with a
    no‑hardware, 2‑week pilot and simple SOP for operators.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo, send a sample set, and start a 2‑week pilot.
    Transitional: Download a sample QC report and spec template or try the ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    Consistent, objective QC; faster release decisions; reduced scrap and
    rework; fewer complaints and chargebacks; audit‑ready traceability; smoother
    scale‑up for new SKUs; happier retailers and brand teams.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing subjective checks that miss defects, cause waste and delays, trigger
    complaints and penalties, and increase audit risk across lines and shifts.

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - 'Manual checks are slow, subjective, and inconsistent.'
    - Color and gloss require lab fixtures and trained eyes.
    - 'Late defect finds cause rework, scrap, and release delays.'
    - Spec drift goes unnoticed between periodic lab runs.
    - Multi-SKU changeovers make tolerance control difficult.
    - Audit trails are scattered across spreadsheets and folders.
  solution:
    - AI standardizes QC from simple photo uploads.
    - Instant pass/fail against per-SKU specs and tolerances.
    - Works with smartphone or line camera images—no new hardware.
    - Trend alerts catch drift before it becomes waste.
    - 'Audit-ready reports with images, measurements, and decisions.'
  features:
    - 'Size and shape metrics: length, width, thickness, roundness, aspect ratio.'
    - 'Color and gloss scores: L*a*b*, hue, uniformity, shine index.'
    - 'Defect detection: cracks, chips, pits, bubbles, misshapes, residue.'
    - 'Product libraries with tolerances, AQL rules, and sampling plans.'
    - Auto-scale using reference card or known tray geometry.
    - Batch analysis and piece counts from gridded trays.
    - Confidence scores and human-in-the-loop review.
    - 'SPC charts, trends, and out-of-control alerts.'
    - 'Exports: CSV, PDF, API; email/Slack notifications.'
    - 'Secure audit trail with timestamps, users, and e-signatures.'
  steps:
    - Define product specs and tolerances.
    - Upload sample photos from the line or lightbox.
    - 'Confirm scale/reference; tag product, lot, and line.'
    - 'Run analysis—get measurements, color/gloss, and defect map.'
    - Review pass/fail; export report or sync to QMS/LIMS.
