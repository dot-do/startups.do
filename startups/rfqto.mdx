leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow RFQ turnaround (typically 24–72 hours) lowers win rates; buyers often
      award to the first viable quote. A 24-hour delay can cut win probability
      by 10–20%.
    - >-
      Highly manual RFQ intake from emails/PDFs; 30–60 minutes of data entry and
      back-and-forth per RFQ even for repeat product families.
    - >-
      Inconsistent costing and tribal knowledge; 3–5 margin points of slippage
      due to missed setups, make-ready waste, or wrong run speeds.
    - >-
      Imposition/yield is picked heuristically; 1–3% material overuse on
      sheet/roll layouts, ganging, and die-up selection.
    - >-
      Estimate capacity is a bottleneck; 1–3 senior estimators gate throughput,
      causing quote backlog and lost opportunities.
    - >-
      No closed-loop calibration; quotes aren’t reconciled to actual route
      times, yields, and scrap, so models drift and pricing confidence erodes.
    - >-
      Complex routings (laminating, coating, die-cutting, folding/gluing, foil,
      emboss, windowing) and customer-specific pack-out rules create rework and
      change orders when assumptions are not explicit.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from email inboxes, portals, and shared drives; parse PDFs,
      spreadsheets, and images with domain-tuned OCR/LLM.
    - >-
      Extract specs using a 322299 taxonomy (substrate, caliper, sheet/roll,
      finished dims, die-line, coatings/laminations, quantities, tolerances,
      pack-out, quality/inspection).
    - >-
      Resolve gaps: auto-ask clarifying questions or propose standard
      assumptions with confidence scores; log all assumptions in the quote.
    - >-
      Auto-route selection: choose process steps and machines from a customer’s
      routings library based on product family, tolerances, and SLAs.
    - >-
      Imposition-aware yield: optimize die-up, nesting/ganging, sheet/roll
      widths, grain direction, and make-ready waste; simulate alternates to
      maximize yield and throughput.
    - >-
      Build BOM and time standards: material, machine setup/run times, crews,
      changeovers, WIP handling, scrap factors, inspection steps.
    - >-
      Cost and price: compute fully burdened cost (materials, labor, overhead),
      apply customer/product margin bands, offer alternates (e.g., different
      substrate or layout).
    - >-
      Generate quotes: branded PDF/email with itemized costs (optional),
      assumptions, alternates, and validity; push to MIS/ERP (quote/order) and
      CRM.
    - >-
      Approvals and risk flags: exception routing for low-margin, tight
      tolerances, or uncertain specs; what-if analysis for price/lead-time
      trade-offs.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: reconcile quotes to actuals (times, yields, scrap)
      to recalibrate rates, speeds, and scrap, improving accuracy over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs (emails/PDFs) into routed, costed, imposition-optimized quotes
    with documented assumptions in minutes—integrated to your MIS/ERP—cutting
    quote time by 80%, improving material yield 1–3%, and holding margin
    variance within ±2 pts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned, imposition-aware costing engine trained on thousands of
    322299 RFQs and reconciled to production actuals, plus prebuilt MIS/ERP and
    CAD integrations. The closed-loop learning from estimates-to-actuals
    systematically improves accuracy, while explicit assumption logging reduces
    change orders. Competitors offer generic OCR or standalone imposition, but
    not an end-to-end RFQ-to-quote workflow with measurable yield and margin
    control.

  character: >-
    Estimating and operations leaders at converted paper manufacturers (NAICS
    322299) who need to turn messy RFQs into fast, accurate, margin-safe quotes.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as unstructured emails/PDFs; routing, imposition, and
    yield math are manual and slow. Internal: estimators are overloaded; cycle
    times lag; confidence in costing is shaky. Philosophical: winning work
    shouldn’t depend on tribal knowledge or late nights in spreadsheets.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we’ve lived converting quotes and know the chaos. Authority: AI
    trained on 322299 workflows (printing, coating, laminating, slitting,
    sheeting, die-cutting, folding/gluing), validated by senior estimators;
    integrates with ERP/MES; clear assumptions and traceability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect inbox/ERP; import materials, rates, scrap factors. 2) Bot parses
    RFQs and proposes routed, costed quotes with assumptions and
    imposition-aware material yield. 3) You review/adjust, then one-click push
    to ERP/CRM and send.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 20-minute demo. Transitional: Upload 3 sample RFQs for a
    free benchmark report.
  success: >-
    Quotes in minutes, not hours; +2–5 margin points protected; 15–30% higher
    win rate from faster response; estimator capacity 2–3x; 1–3% material waste
    reduction via optimized imposition; audit-ready assumptions and routings in
    your ERP.
  failure: >-
    Missed RFQs, delayed responses, over/underquoting, margin leakage, customer
    churn, and risky dependence on tribal knowledge when key people are out.
