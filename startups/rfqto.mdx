leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Proposal teams in oil and gas equipment manufacturing spend 8–40 hours per
      RFQ stitching together specs, compliance matrices, configuration options,
      pricing, and documentation.
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as long, inconsistent documents (PDF/Word/Excel) referencing
      API/ASME/NACE/IEC standards; extracting requirements and mapping to
      catalog/config rules is error-prone.
    - >-
      Missed or misinterpreted clauses (e.g., API 610, ASME Section VIII, NACE
      MR0175) cause costly deviations, rework, or disqualification.
    - >-
      Cycle times are too long for tight bid windows; organizations forgo bids
      or submit late, harming win rates.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal; proposal quality varies by engineer and region;
      compliance traceability is weak for audits.
    - >-
      Existing CPQ/RFP tools lack deep technical standards mapping and BOM-level
      configuration for oil and gas equipment.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs (email, portal, SharePoint) and parse
      PDFs/Word/Excel/drawings; extract structured requirements, quantities,
      delivery terms, and vendor document lists.
    - >-
      Map requirements to product catalog and configuration rules; generate
      draft datasheets, BOM, routings, and cost roll-ups.
    - >-
      Produce compliance matrices against API/ASME/NACE sections with
      clause-level traceability and auto-detected deviations/clarifications.
    - >-
      Assemble a draft technical and commercial proposal package (cover letter,
      scope, datasheets, compliance matrix, exceptions, testing/inspection plan,
      schedule, warranty, T&Cs placeholders).
    - >-
      Integrate with CRM/CPQ/ERP/PLM (Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Teamcenter,
      Windchill) to pull pricing, lead times, and export part lineage.
    - >-
      Provide human-in-the-loop review workflows, versioning, audit trails, and
      digital approvals; export in customer-specific templates.
    - >-
      Offer on-prem/private cloud deployment with full data residency and SOC
      2/ISO 27001 controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Draft API/ASME-compliant technical and commercial proposals from RFQs in
    minutes, not days—mapping requirements to your catalog/configured options
    with auditable compliance matrices and human-in-the-loop control. Reduce
    proposal cycle time by 60–80%, increase compliance coverage to 98%+, and
    standardize quality across teams.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned standards library and knowledge graph tied to product
    configuration rules, clause-level compliance reasoning, and BOM-aware
    mapping—plus certified integrations to ERP/PLM/CPQ and on-prem deployment.
    Over time, proprietary labeled datasets from real RFQs/proposals (with
    customer consent) create a flywheel that general RFP tools and generic LLMs
    lack.

  character: >-
    Bid/proposal managers and sales engineers at oil & gas field machinery OEMs
    who must turn complex RFQs into compliant, client-ready proposals fast.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs are long, inconsistent, and standards-bound (API/ASME).
    Internal: teams juggle spreadsheets and tribal knowledge, risking errors and
    delays. Philosophical: Winning work shouldn’t depend on manual copy‑paste
    and compliance guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived the bid crunch. Our API/ASME-aware AI maps RFQ requirements to
    your catalogs/configurators and outputs traceable, audit-ready compliance
    matrices and proposal drafts.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your product catalog/configurator and templates. 2) Upload RFQs
    (PDF/Excel/specs). 3) Auto-draft technical and commercial content with
    requirement-to-option mapping and a compliance matrix. 4) Review, approve,
    and export to your proposal format and CRM/ERP.
  callToAction: Request a demo and start a pilot—upload an RFQ to see a draft in minutes.
  success: >-
    Shorter proposal cycles, higher first-pass compliance, clearer traceability,
    and more time for engineering value—leading to stronger, more competitive
    bids.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines, non-compliant submissions, costly rework, and lost deals
    to faster, more consistent competitors.
