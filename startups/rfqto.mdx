  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ processing is slow and labor-intensive: 1–3 hours per RFQ across
      estimator, sales, and procurement; backlogs cause delayed responses and
      lost awards.
    - >-
      Quote accuracy varies by estimator; tribal knowledge leads to 10–25% cost
      variance vs actuals, causing margin erosion or overpricing.
    - >-
      Inconsistent risk identification: tolerances, special processes,
      materials, and compliance (ITAR/DFARS) risks are often missed.
    - >-
      Fragmented inputs (PDFs, STEP files, DXFs, BOM spreadsheets, emails)
      require manual consolidation and re-entry into ERP/CRM.
    - >-
      Shops cannot economically respond to small or low-probability RFQs;
      response rates fall below 30%, lowering pipeline health.
    - >-
      Lead-time promises are disconnected from real capacity/material
      availability; late deliveries and expedite costs follow.
    - >-
      Compliance and documentation overhead (traceability, ITAR data handling,
      AS9100 documentation) slows quoting and increases liability.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop learning: estimates are not systematically compared to
      actuals to improve future quoting.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parsing of RFQs: ingest emails, PDFs, BOMs, and technical drawings;
      extract line items, quantities, materials, finishes, tolerances,
      certifications.
    - >-
      CAD feature recognition: analyze STEP/SolidWorks/Parasolid to derive
      features (holes, pockets, threads, thin walls), part volumes, ops
      sequences, and surface area for finishing.
    - >-
      Automated cost/lead-time estimation: cycle-time models per machine class,
      setup time heuristics, material usage/yields, outside processes, and
      vendor lead times.
    - >-
      Capacity-aware lead-time: simulate queue availability by workcenter and
      supplier lead times to propose realistic promise dates.
    - >-
      Quote drafting: generate line-item pricing, terms, exceptions, risk notes,
      and alternates; multi-currency/tiered pricing; export to
      PDF/email/ERP/CRM.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review and approvals: estimator review UI, deviation
      warnings, and e-sign off; audit trail for certifications (AS9100/ISO).
    - >-
      DFM/DFQ alerts: identify manufacturability risks (tight GD&T, deep
      pockets, thin walls, tight bend radii) and suggest design alternates.
    - >-
      Material and supplier pricing: live feeds/APIs to metals distributors,
      platers, heat treaters; track quotes and historicals.
    - >-
      Integrations: push/pull with ERPs (JobBOSS, ProShop, Global Shop, MIE
      Trak, Odoo), CRMs (HubSpot/Salesforce), CAD (SolidWorks/Fusion), and file
      vaults.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: compare estimates to actuals (labor, scrap, outside
      processing, purchase prices) to recalibrate models per shop.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2, optional US-only processing for ITAR/EAR;
      on-premises or VPC deployment options; encryption and data residency
      controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut quote turnaround from days to minutes with AI that reads RFQs and CAD,
    estimates cost and lead time, and drafts compliant quotes and risk
    notes—consistently and traceably—so manufacturers win more work at protected
    margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on anonymized, cross-shop actuals tied to CAD features,
    plus deep ERP/CAD integrations and ITAR-ready deployment options embed the
    tool in daily quoting workflows and produce accuracy that point solutions
    and manual methods can’t match.
