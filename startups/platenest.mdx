  problem:
    - >-
      Plate procurement lead times (2–12+ weeks for common grades like A36/A572;
      6–20+ weeks for SA-516-70N, stainless, duplex) often exceed project
      release-to-cut windows, causing expediting costs and missed ship dates.
    - >-
      Material overbuy/underbuy from rough BOM estimates leads to 3–10% yield
      loss and 2–6% purchase price variance (PPV) due to late buys and unplanned
      mill/service center choices.
    - >-
      Late-stage nesting reveals geometry-driven shortages (rolling direction,
      grain, seam allowances, trim, head developments) that MRP/BOM cannot
      anticipate, creating rework and job delays.
    - >-
      Programmer bottlenecks: high-skill CAM time spent on non-value-added
      what-if work during planning; 6–20 hours per complex job consumed before
      any PO is placed.
    - >-
      Remnant chaos: inconsistent reuse policies and poor visibility into drops
      cause 1–3% annual material write-offs and congested floor space.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability (ASME Section VIII, heat/lot tracking)
      complicate pre-buys; planners fear mixing heats or violating weld/pressure
      boundary rules without system guardrails.
    - >-
      Quoting risk: geometry-driven yield assumptions are guessed, resulting in
      underquoted material on 10–20% of custom builds.
  solution:
    - >-
      Import project CAD/BOM (STEP/DXF/SolidWorks/Inventor) and explode shell
      courses, heads, cones, nozzles into developed flat patterns with
      allowances and weld/seam rules.
    - >-
      AI-driven pre-nesting simulates thousands of nest scenarios against real
      vendor plate catalogs and in-house remnants to compute optimal buy plans
      before detailed programming.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware engine: rolling/grain direction, plate size limits (e.g.,
      96x240, 120x480), trim, bevel allowances, part pairing for press rolls,
      heat/lot segregation rules, and table-specific cutting envelopes.
    - >-
      Scenario optimizer delivers purchase options (Aggressive Buy vs
      Conservative vs Cost-Optimal) with yield, lead-time risk, and PPV
      forecasts, including mill vs service center trade-offs.
    - >-
      One-click PO requisitions to ERP with grade, thickness, plate size,
      quantity, required dates, and alternate lines; reserve remnants for the
      job to lock plan integrity.
    - >-
      Change tracking: highlights revision deltas, auto-re-optimizes buy plan,
      and flags impacted POs for change orders before suppliers ship.
    - >-
      Downstream hand-off: exports cut lists and nests to existing CAM
      (SigmaNEST/ProNest/Lantek) so programmers finish details without rework.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Order the right plate on Day 1. AI pre-nesting transforms CAD/BOM into
    purchase-ready plate plans with constraints, boosting yield by 3–8 points,
    pulling POs forward 2–6 weeks, and cutting programmer planning time by
    50%—without changing your downstream CAM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A geometry- and constraint-aware pre-nesting engine purpose-built for heavy
    plate tanks, trained on anonymized multi-shop yield and lead-time data, plus
    plug-and-play CAM/ERP connectors—delivering purchase-ready plans before
    programming that incumbent nesting tools and generic MRP cannot match.

  character: >-
    Ops, production planning, and purchasing leaders at heavy-gauge steel tank
    manufacturers (NAICS 332420) who must secure plate and schedule cuts early
    to hit margins and ship dates.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile steel prices, long mill lead times, and late nesting make
    material a guessing game—leading to overbuys, rush fees, scrap, and missed
    dates. Internal: teams lack early, accurate plate requirements.
    Philosophical: you shouldn’t have to gamble on material to keep promises.
  guide: >-
    An AI pre-plan partner built for heavy-gauge tank work. We understand
    traceability, heat/grade, bevel allowances, kerf, and drop reuse—and
    integrate with CAD/CAM and ERP to deliver reliable buy lists and nests
    before programming.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/CAD/CAM or upload part lists by thickness/grade. 2) Generate
    optimized pre-program nests, drop strategy, and a buy list by plate size
    with confidence ranges. 3) Lock POs and schedule with exports to ERP/CAM and
    change-impact alerts.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo and pilot on your next build with your real parts.
  success: >-
    Confident early buys, shorter lead times, lower plate spend and expedites,
    higher laser utilization, better drop recovery, fewer change-orders, and
    on-time, profitable shipments.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing material, paying premiums, re-nesting late, scrapping plate,
    idling machines, and missing dates—eroding margins and customer trust.
