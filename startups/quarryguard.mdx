  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of bearings, motors, and gearboxes on conveyors and
      crushers cause high-cost production losses ($5k–$20k/hour) and safety
      risks in NAICS 212319 operations.
    - >-
      Route-based vibration checks are infrequent and miss early-stage faults;
      manual data interpretation is inconsistent across sites and vendors.
    - >-
      Data silos between sensors, PLC/SCADA, and CMMS prevent prioritization;
      maintenance teams struggle to know which assets truly need attention this
      week.
    - >-
      Alarm fatigue from threshold-only monitoring leads to ignored alerts;
      low-RPM gearboxes and shock loads in quarries confound generic analytics.
    - >-
      Spare parts lead times for critical drivetrains (weeks/months) turn minor
      issues into extended outages without early warning.
    - >-
      Labor shortages: many quarries lack on-site reliability experts to
      interpret data and optimize interventions.
    - >-
      Difficult to quantify maintenance ROI and justify budgets without
      measurable, site-level performance metrics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud monitoring that ingests triaxial vibration, temperature,
      motor current (MCSA), runtime, and load, fused with CMMS history
      (failures, work orders, parts).
    - >-
      AI risk scores (0–100) by component (bearing/motor/gearbox) with predicted
      lead time to failure (7–45 days typical for bearing/gear faults) and
      confidence bands.
    - >-
      Automated prioritization: top 10 assets/week with recommended
      interventions (inspect, lube, align, replace), estimated production risk,
      and required spares.
    - >-
      CMMS integration (SAP PM, IBM Maximo, eMaint, Fiix, others) to
      auto-create, prioritize, and close work orders; feedback loops improve
      models.
    - >-
      Deployment kits for quarry environments (IP67/68 sensors, armored cabling,
      dust-proof enclosures; optional wireless mesh for long conveyors).
    - >-
      Remote monitoring service option: reliability engineers review anomalies
      weekly, validate root causes, and co-own action plans.
    - >-
      Executive dashboards: downtime avoided, alerts precision/recall, savings,
      backlog health; exportable evidence for MSHA/EHS and budget approvals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned conveyor/crusher failures by 30–50% and maintenance costs
    by 10–20% within 6–12 months by turning vibration, temperature, motor
    current, and CMMS history into prioritized risk scores and auto-generated
    work orders tailored to quarry duty.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quarry plant managers, reliability engineers, and maintenance supervisors
    (NAICS 212319) who want steady throughput from conveyors and crushers,
    predictable maintenance costs, and safer operations.
  problem: >-
    - External: Bearings, motors, and gearboxes fail without warning; dust,
    shock loads, and belt mistracking accelerate wear; sensor/CMMS data is
    siloed.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting and blind spots; hard to know which asset
    is next to fail or when to intervene.

    - Philosophical: Heavy equipment should warn before it fails; maintenance
    time should go to the highest‑risk components.

    - Stakes: Hours of downtime per incident, lost tons, rush parts and
    overtime, safety exposure, and missed delivery penalties.
  guide: >-
    We understand the harsh, dusty realities of quarrying and the cost of a
    stopped belt or crusher. Our AI service risk‑scores bearings, motors, and
    gearboxes using vibration, temperature, current, and CMMS
    history—purpose‑built for conveyors and crushers in NAICS 212319. Proven
    integrations, clear action lists, and measurable ROI.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Plug in to existing vibration/temperature/current sensors and
    your CMMS—no plant rewire.

    - Baseline: Learn each asset’s normal behavior and compute risk scores by
    component.

    - Act: Receive a weekly, prioritized intervention list with severity, lead
    time, and parts suggestions pushed to your CMMS.

    - Improve: Close the loop on work orders; track avoided downtime, MTBF
    gains, and ROI on a dashboard.

    - Start small: 60‑day pilot on one circuit with clear success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute discovery call or start a 60‑day pilot on one
    conveyor/crusher circuit.
