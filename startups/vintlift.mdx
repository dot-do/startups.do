leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Most winery ecommerce sites convert at 0.8–1.8% versus 2.5%+ for general
      DTC, leaving revenue on the table.
    - >-
      Shipping costs and thresholds are the #1 cart abandonment driver; wineries
      struggle to set profitable free-ship thresholds that maximize take rate
      and margin.
    - >-
      Bundles and case deals are underutilized or static; wineries lack
      data-driven methods to assemble profitable bundles that move inventory and
      raise AOV.
    - >-
      Limited in-house CRO expertise and bandwidth—DTC managers juggle club,
      tasting room, email, compliance, and can’t run rigorous tests.
    - >-
      Generic CRO tools ignore wine-specific constraints (compliance,
      allocations, vintages, inventory levels, bottle size/mix, club member
      rules).
    - >-
      Seasonality (harvest, holidays) creates demand spikes but sites aren’t
      dynamically merchandised to capture uplift.
    - >-
      Hard to attribute incremental revenue to onsite changes; many wineries
      rely on discounts instead of optimizing offers and merchandising.
    - >-
      Platform limitations (Commerce7, WineDirect, Shopify + wine apps) make
      true price testing and personalization cumbersome.
  solution:
    - >-
      Lightweight script + native connectors to Commerce7, WineDirect, Shopify,
      GA4, Klaviyo for data ingestion and on-site experiences.
    - >-
      AI merchandising that reorders collections and PDP recommendations based
      on price elasticity, inventory, and club/allocations.
    - >-
      Dynamic bundle builder that assembles 3/6/12-bottle packs to hit target
      AOV and margin; auto-rotates vintage or varietal focus.
    - >-
      Price and shipping-threshold testing engine that finds profit-maximizing
      list prices, case discounts, and free-ship thresholds by region/club.
    - >-
      Offer and promotion orchestration that time-boxes deals, caps redemptions,
      and prevents margin erosion.
    - >-
      Experimentation framework with holdouts, CUPED variance reduction, and
      profitability guardrails.
    - >-
      Weekly opportunity scans (e.g., long-tail SKUs, overstock, new releases)
      with 1-click tests.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard quantifying incremental net revenue, margin impact,
      significance, and cohort breakdowns (club vs non-club).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compliance- and inventory-aware AI that lifts winery DTC conversion and AOV
    10–25% in 90 days by optimizing merchandising, bundles, and price/threshold
    tests—deployed in days, measured with clean, auditable incrementality.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
