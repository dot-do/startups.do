  problem:
    - >-
      Operators rely on gut feel or static planograms; machine-level demand
      varies widely by site, season, and daypart, causing missed sales and
      excessive stales.
    - >-
      Existing vending software reports what sold but doesn’t prescribe exact
      SKU swaps, facings, and slot assignments under real-world constraints
      (coil width, capacity, temperature zones, planogram layout).
    - >-
      Manual planogram updates are slow (1–2 hours per bank), error-prone, and
      not continuously refreshed with telemetry data.
    - >-
      Price/pack decisions and SKU rationalization are not data-driven,
      resulting in low margin mix and underperforming SKUs occupying facings.
    - >-
      Route and warehouse teams lack simple, machine-specific picklists and slot
      maps tied to the latest planograms, leading to misloads and compliance
      drift.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven planogram engine that optimizes SKU mix, facings, and exact
      slot numbers per machine under physical and operational constraints.
    - >-
      Forecasting + price elasticity modeling at the machine level to predict
      sales by SKU, adjust prices/facings, and respond to seasonality/events.
    - >-
      Automated, printer- and mobile-ready planogram outputs with slot maps and
      picklists; one-click export to warehouse pre-kit systems.
    - >-
      A/B testing framework: split machines into control/test, measure
      incremental gross profit, stale rate reduction, and stockouts.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: weekly refreshes using latest telemetry,
      out-of-stocks, spoilage, and local demand signals.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: test adding/removing SKUs, contract requirements, and
      price changes before rollout.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase profit per machine by $10–$35 per month through AI-driven SKU
    swaps, facings, and slot assignments—no new hardware. Integrates with your
    telemetry to auto-generate machine-specific planograms, reduce stales by
    20–40%, lift sales 5–12%, and cut planogram build time by 80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-operator telemetry-trained demand and elasticity models plus a
    constraint solver tailored to vending physics and contracts; deep
    integrations with the top telemetry platforms and distributors; growing
    library of slot dimension templates and SKU performance benchmarks by
    micro-geo and venue type that new entrants lack.
