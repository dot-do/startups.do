  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers must collect, version, and distribute up-to-date Safety Data
      Sheets (SDS) and Technical Data Sheets (TDS) for thousands of SKUs from
      hundreds of suppliers; doing this manually often requires 10–30 minutes
      per document and results in outdated or missing SDS at shipping time.
    - >-
      Order shipments are delayed or put on hold while staff locate and email
      SDS bundles to customers, especially on first-time shipments or when SDS
      revisions occur; this can add 0.5–1.5 days to fulfillment for regulated
      materials.
    - >-
      Regulatory exposure: OSHA HazCom 2012/GHS, DOT/TDG shipping, WHMIS, and
      SARA 313 reporting require accurate, current documents; audit trails are
      fragmented across email, shared drives, ERPs, and local folders.
    - >-
      Supplier SDS/TDS are inconsistent (formats, languages, scanned PDFs); key
      data fields (hazard statements, PPE, storage/handling, UN numbers,
      pictograms) are error-prone to extract, creating risk for mislabeling and
      improper handling.
    - >-
      Version control and revision surveillance are weak; many distributors
      discover SDS updates only after a customer requests the new version or
      during audits, causing rework and reputational risk.
    - >-
      Existing generic document management systems don’t integrate tightly with
      distributor ERPs/WMS or auto-generate customer- and order-specific SDS
      bundles with correct branding, languages, and the latest versions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Centralized SDS/TDS library: ingest from supplier portals, email,
      EDI/FTP/API; deduplicate, OCR, classify by SKU and supplier; maintain
      version history and effective dates.
    - >-
      Coatings-tuned extraction: structured fields for HazCom/GHS (hazard
      classes, H/P statements, pictograms, signal word), transportation (UN,
      proper shipping name, packing group), composition, storage/handling, PPE,
      VOCs, flash point, and application instructions (for TDS).
    - >-
      Revision surveillance: monitor supplier sources and file hashes; alert and
      auto-replace when newer revisions are detected; configurable grace periods
      and customer notification workflows.
    - >-
      Order-aware bundling: generate customer-ready SDS packets on order
      creation/ship confirm (ERP integration), ensuring latest versions, correct
      languages, and customer branding; optionally include TDS and product data
      bulletins.
    - >-
      Compliance automations: rules engine for first-shipment SDS, annual
      re-issue on revision, jurisdiction-specific inclusions (OSHA vs WHMIS),
      and record-keeping to prove delivery (email, portal access logs).
    - >-
      Integrations: plug-ins for Epicor Prophet 21, Infor CloudSuite/SX.e,
      NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics 365, SAP B1; label/pack-slip systems
      (Loftware/NiceLabel); S3/SharePoint/Box.
    - >-
      Audit-grade traceability: immutable logs (what was sent, to whom, when,
      which version) with dashboards and exportable evidence packs for
      audits/incident reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    The coatings-specific SDS/TDS compliance engine that ingests supplier
    documents at scale, keeps them current, and auto-generates customer- and
    order-ready bundles directly from your ERP—reducing ship holds, audit risk,
    and manual effort by 70–90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A coatings-specific SDS/TDS ground-truth library and extraction models
    trained on supplier idiosyncrasies, plus deep ERP event integrations (e.g.,
    Prophet 21, NetSuite) that produce order-aware bundles
    automatically—reducing ship holds in a way generic document systems and
    broad EHS platforms don’t prioritize.

    Ops/compliance leaders at paint, varnish, and supplies merchant wholesalers
    (NAICS 424950) who need every order to ship with accurate, up-to-date
    SDS/TDS—without manual chasing.
  problem: >-
    External: Supplier SDS/TDS are scattered, inconsistent, and frequently
    updated; manual extraction and bundling waste hours and invite errors.
    Internal: Teams worry about audits, last‑minute customer requests, and
    shipment holds. Philosophical: Keeping people safe and compliant shouldn’t
    be a paperwork burden.
  guide: >-
    We understand coatings distribution workflows and HazCom/GHS obligations.
    Our team combines regulatory know‑how with AI data extraction to streamline
    SDS/TDS ops—offering clear implementation, validation workflows, and
    responsive support.
  plan: >-
    Process: (1) Connect suppliers and ERP/order data; (2) Ingest SDS/TDS,
    normalize and extract hazards/handling/storage/transport data, versioned and
    mapped to SKUs/customers; (3) Auto‑generate and deliver customer‑ready SDS
    bundles per order via portal/API/email, with audit trails and optional human
    review. Agreement: security‑first design, SLAs, accuracy checkpoints, and
    easy data export.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot with your top
    suppliers. Transitional: Get the SDS/TDS Readiness Checklist and a tailored
    ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    A single source of truth for SDS/TDS; compliant, on‑time shipments;
    audit‑ready documentation; hours saved per order; fewer support tickets;
    consistent customer experience; scalable as SKUs and suppliers grow.
  failure: >-
    Without this, distributors face fines and failed audits, shipment delays
    from missing documents, costly rework, lost accounts, and safety exposure
    that harms the brand.
