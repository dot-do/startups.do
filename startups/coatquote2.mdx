  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive via email/PDF/portals in inconsistent formats, requiring
      manual parsing that consumes 15–40 minutes per RFQ and delays responses.
    - >-
      Spec compliance is complex (VOC by state/county, LEED v4, MIL/OEM specs,
      hazmat shipping, packaging sizes) and errors create legal/brand risk.
    - >-
      Alternate/equivalent matching is tribal knowledge; mis-matches lead to
      rework, substitutions rejected by customers, or lost bids.
    - >-
      Inventory and lead-time checks are not embedded in quoting, causing quotes
      for out-of-stock items and delayed fulfillment.
    - >-
      Margin leakage from inconsistent pricing and missing customer-specific
      terms/rebates is common (1–3% GM impact).
    - >-
      Sales teams lack a single source of truth for approved alternates and
      compliance rules; onboarding new hires takes months.
    - >-
      Quote cycle times exceed customer expectations (often 24–72 hours),
      lowering win rates in time-sensitive jobs.
    - >-
      Limited analytics on RFQ throughput, win/loss reasons, and spec compliance
      prevent continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (ERP, PIM, pricing tools, spreadsheets) increase
      swivel-chair work and error rates.
    - >-
      Inadequate audit trails and approvals create risk in regulated markets and
      large public bids.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from email inboxes, portals, EDI, and file uploads (PDF,
      Excel, images); auto-deduplicate and thread by opportunity.
    - >-
      Parse line items and specs with domain-tuned AI (OCR + LLM + NER) to
      identify product, package size/finish/base, color system, and regulatory
      constraints.
    - >-
      Map items to distributor catalog with confidence scoring; propose approved
      alternates when exact matches are unavailable or non-compliant.
    - >-
      Check compliance against jurisdictional VOC limits, LEED v4 credits,
      OEM/MIL specs, and hazmat shipping constraints; flag exceptions with
      rationale.
    - >-
      Query ERP for real-time price, stock by branch/DC, lead-times, and
      customer-specific terms/rebates; compute margin-safe pricing using rules
      and guardrails.
    - >-
      Draft quotes with line-level notes, alternates, substitutions, and
      compliance statements; route for approval based on thresholds and risk.
    - >-
      Publish quotes back to ERP/CRM; generate branded PDFs and optional e-sign;
      write structured audit logs.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture win/loss and customer feedback to improve
      mappings, alternates, and pricing recommendations over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn unstructured RFQs into margin-safe, spec-compliant quotes with approved
    alternates in minutes—not days—boosting win rate and gross margin while
    reducing risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary equivalence and compliance dataset specific to
    paint/coatings distribution—built from real RFQs, quotes, customer
    approvals, and win/loss feedback—improves matching and alternates over time.
    Combined with deep ERP integrations and a coatings-specific rules engine
    (VOC/LEED/MIL/OEM), this creates switching costs and accuracy competitors
    without the dataset cannot easily replicate.
