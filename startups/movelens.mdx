  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 45–90 minutes per in-home survey including travel and
      scheduling, limiting throughput and driving high CAC during peak season.
    - >-
      Phone-based item lists miss bulky/hidden items, causing 10–25% variance in
      cubic-feet/weight estimates, leading to re-quotes, discounts, and customer
      dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Quote turnaround time (TAT) is slow (often 24–72 hours), hurting
      lead-to-booking conversion rates in a fast-responding competitive market.
    - >-
      Inconsistent estimator skill and documentation lead to disputes and higher
      claims; condition-at-origin is rarely captured at scale.
    - >-
      Office/commercial moves require precise inventories and asset tagging;
      manual surveying is error-prone and difficult to standardize across crews.
    - >-
      Scaling field surveys during May–September peak is costly and constrained
      by staffing; overtime and subcontracting reduce margin.
    - >-
      Van lines/brokers struggle with estimate consistency across multiple
      agents/locations; limited visibility into estimator performance metrics.
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance documentation (e.g., inventories, disclosures) is
      fragmented and not automatically packaged with quotes.
    - >-
      High no-show/low-intent leads waste estimator time; poor pre-qualification
      before scheduling surveys.
    - >-
      Environmental and cost pressures to reduce unnecessary truck rolls and
      estimator travel.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision processes customer-shot video/photos to detect
      furniture/appliances/boxes and estimate cubic feet and weight by room.
    - >-
      Automatic recognition of stairs, elevators, narrow doors, and long carries
      to suggest crew size, equipment, and truck count.
    - >-
      Narration capture with speech-to-text and OCR for special handling notes
      (e.g., crating, disassembly) and access constraints.
    - >-
      Auto-generated, editable inventory grouped by room; mover can
      add/remove/override items with search and templates.
    - >-
      Tariff/pricelist engine applies mover-specific pricing to produce an
      e-signable quote and booking link; taxes/surcharges handled.
    - >-
      Customer submits at their convenience via a guided link (no app download);
      option for live video co-pilot if desired.
    - >-
      Condition-at-origin photo snippets auto-attached to inventory for claims
      mitigation and dispute resolution.
    - >-
      One-click export to mover CRM/dispatch/TMS; API and white-label portal for
      enterprise networks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA for high-value/complex jobs to ensure accuracy and
      handle edge cases.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard tracking quote TAT, accuracy, booking rate uplift, and
      estimator productivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn a 5–10 minute smartphone walkthrough into a defensible, itemized
    inventory and e-signable quote in under 15 minutes—cutting estimator time by
    70%+ while improving volume/weight accuracy to within ±10% on typical HHG
    moves.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rapidly compounding, vertical-specific dataset of annotated move
    walkthroughs and verified outcomes (actual cube/weight and claims), coupled
    with deep integrations into moving CRMs/tariffs and estimator
    workflows—creating accuracy, workflow, and distribution moats competitors
    find hard to replicate.
