leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned fan/blower failures halt production lines, violate IAQ
      standards, and trigger emergency callouts; a single outage can cost
      $5k–$50k per hour in lost output and labor
    - >-
      Early-stage bearing wear, belt slip, motor electrical faults, and impeller
      fouling are hard to detect with route-based inspections; faults often
      surface only days before failure
    - >-
      Time-based maintenance leads to both premature replacements and late
      interventions, inflating parts and labor by 15–30%
    - >-
      Telemetry (VFDs, BAS/BMS, PLCs) is siloed; signals are not fused to
      indicate root cause or risk, and insights rarely flow into CMMS work
      orders
    - >-
      Growing technician shortage and high turnover reduce inspection frequency
      and diagnostic quality
    - >-
      Energy waste (5–15%) from misalignment, belt slip, filter loading, and
      airflow imbalance goes unquantified and unaddressed
    - >-
      Lack of standardized failure signatures across diverse fan/blower types
      delays troubleshooting and increases repeat visits
    - >-
      OEMs lack visibility into field performance and cannot monetize post-sale
      health or proactive service effectively
  solution:
    - >-
      Sensor-agnostic ingestion of VFD/BAS/PLC telemetry (current, torque,
      harmonics, speed/RPM, pressure differential, airflow, temperature) plus
      optional retrofit tri-axial vibration and acoustic sensors
    - >-
      Edge analytics on gateway for real-time anomaly scoring; cloud models for
      fleet learning and prognostics (remaining useful life estimates)
    - >-
      Pre-trained model templates for belt-driven vs direct-drive fans, overhung
      vs centerline impellers, filtration stages, and typical VFD configurations
    - >-
      Physics-informed diagnostics: order analysis for belt slip/misalignment,
      bearing defect detection (BPFO/BPFI/BSF), electrical signature analysis
      for motor faults, airflow anomaly detection vs fan curves, filter loading
      and impeller fouling
    - >-
      Health score and risk index per asset with estimated lead time to failure;
      fleet-level prioritization by criticality and consequence of failure
    - >-
      Auto-creation and routing of work orders in CMMS (Maximo, SAP PM,
      ServiceNow, Fiix, UpKeep) with recommended tasks, skill level, estimated
      duration, and parts BOM
    - >-
      BAS/BMS integration (BACnet/IP, Modbus TCP, OPC UA) for read/write of
      alarms and control adjustments when safe (e.g., derate speed to prevent
      catastrophic failure)
    - >-
      Dashboards and mobile alerts (email/SMS/Slack/Teams) with explainable
      diagnostics and spectral/temporal visualizations
    - >-
      OEM portal for aggregated field performance, warranty analytics, and
      design feedback
    - >-
      Security and device management: OTA updates, role-based access, SOC 2
      roadmap/ISO 27001 alignment
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific, physics-informed AI for fans/blowers that detects bearing,
    belt, motor, and airflow issues weeks early using existing telemetry;
    prioritizes by risk and automatically creates CMMS work orders. Typical
    outcomes: 40–60% fewer unplanned outages, 20% lower maintenance labor, 5–12%
    energy savings, ROI in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Physics-informed, fan/blower-specific AI trained on multi-OEM,
    multi-vertical datasets with explainable diagnostics; deep out-of-the-box
    integrations to VFDs, BAS/BMS, and CMMS enabling true auto-workflow;
    edge-first architecture for low bandwidth and IT-friendly deployments; OEM
    distribution and embedded options that reduce CAC and increase attach rate.
