    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4
  risks:
    - 'Access/paywalls for key databases (JSTOR, Artfacts, Artnet)'
    - Ambiguity in historical records leading to false matches
    - Citations may require manual verification
  dependencies:
    - >-
      User-provided subscriptions (e.g., JSTOR, Artfacts, Artnet/Artprice
      exports)
    - Library APIs access where applicable
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Provenance, literature, and exhibition histories are fragmented across
      catalogs raisonnés, auction catalogs, museum records, dealer archives, and
      periodicals with inconsistent metadata.
    - >-
      Manual research is slow (8–20+ hours per work) and expensive, delaying
      sales and consignments.
    - >-
      Dealers risk legal and reputational exposure (restitution claims, stolen
      art, import/export violations) without standardized due diligence and
      auditable citations.
    - >-
      Existing tools (registries, CMS, price databases) don’t compile a
      defensible dossier with confidence scoring, nor do they flag red flags or
      gaps automatically.
    - >-
      Smaller and mid-sized dealers lack in-house research staff; reliance on
      freelancers causes variable quality and turnaround times.
    - >-
      Buy-side (collectors, advisors) increasingly demand transparent
      provenance; sellers need standardized, professional outputs to support
      price realization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of artist/work data, scans/PDFs, and references;
      multilingual OCR and entity extraction across catalogs raisonnés, auction
      catalogs, museum databases, journals, and dealer archives.
    - >-
      Evidence graph that links claims (ownership, exhibition, publication) to
      cited sources with confidence scores and date ranges; deduplicates and
      reconciles entities (ULAN/VIAF/LCNAF) and work variants.
    - >-
      Risk and gap analysis: flags WWII-era gaps, suspicious chains of
      ownership, embargoed/litigation records, export restrictions,
      sanctions/AML exposure, and stolen art watchlists.
    - >-
      One-click standardized dossier outputs (PDF/Word) with footnoted
      citations, bibliography, exhibition/literature sections, and provenance
      chain timelines.
    - >-
      Workflow with human-in-the-loop review: assign to vetted researchers,
      version control, audit logs, and approval steps; supports internal policy
      templates.
    - >-
      Integrations: export to Artlogic, GallerySystems TMS, ArtBase; API for
      custom CMS and registries; reference manager export (RIS/BibTeX).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create defensible provenance and exhibition history dossiers 10x faster with
    source citations, evidence graphs, and confidence scores—reducing risk,
    standardizing outputs, and accelerating time-to-sale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, annotated corpus of provenance cases and evidence graphs
    co-developed with leading dealers and provenance researchers, plus
    integrations embedded in dealer CMS workflows and endorsements from art
    law/insurance partners—creating switching costs and trust that generic AI or
    price databases lack.
