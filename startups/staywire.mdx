leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Voluntary churn in wireline/broadband averages 12–25% annually;
      acquisition costs of $300–$600 per customer make retention ROI-critical.
    - >-
      Retention is reactive and channel-specific (call-center save desks) with
      little early warning or prioritized outreach.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across billing/BRM, CRM, care/ticketing, and network KPIs,
      preventing precise targeting and causing blanket discounts that erode
      margin.
    - >-
      Limited, manual A/B testing and weak causal measurement make it hard to
      prove uplift and secure budget.
    - >-
      Existing tools lack telco-specific uplift modeling and real-time triggers
      (e.g., service degradation, price increase), leading to late or misaligned
      offers.
    - >-
      Internal data science capacity is stretched; models decay and are not
      operationalized into orchestration with guardrails and compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Telco-tuned churn and uplift models ingesting billing/BRM, CRM, trouble
      tickets, NPS/CSAT, network events, plan/price changes, tenure, promo
      eligibility, and competitive footprint.
    - >-
      Next-best-retention action engine with economics guardrails (max discount,
      ARPU floor, segment budgets) and eligibility rules (contract status,
      device financing, credit risk).
    - >-
      Real-time orchestration (sub-60s latency) to trigger outreach via
      Salesforce/Adobe, Twilio/Sinch, Genesys/Five9/NICE, and in-agent consoles;
      APIs/webhooks for portals/apps.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box retention playbooks: price increase save, service
      degradation apology credit, speed upgrade trade-off, contract renewal
      loyalty bundle, win-back within 60 days, SMB multi-line save.
    - >-
      Experimentation layer: A/B/n, multi-armed bandits, geo/holdout testing,
      power calculator; causal lift measurement with standardized incrementality
      dashboards.
    - >-
      Pre-built integrations to Amdocs, Netcracker, CSG, Oracle BRM, SAP BRIM,
      Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics; telco data model and feature store
      templates.
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: consent/TCPA/GDPR handling, audit logs, role-based
      access, encryption, data residency controls.
    - >-
      Deployable as SaaS in VPC or private cloud; MLOps with monthly retraining,
      drift monitoring, and canary releases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce voluntary churn 15–30% within 90 days by predicting who will churn,
    when, and why—then triggering the highest-margin save action across email,
    SMS, agent, IVR, and portal, fully integrated with your BSS/CRM and measured
    with causal uplift and continuous A/B testing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A telco-specific uplift and economics optimization engine with pre-built
    integrations to major BSS/CRMs and contact centers, plus anonymized
    cross-carrier benchmarks of offer performance—enabling pilots to ROI in 90
    days and preventing margin leakage with automated guardrails that generic
    CDPs/ML platforms and in-house builds struggle to deliver.
