leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inspections are manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming (8–20
      staff-hours/week for a 300-slip marina).
    - >-
      Issues on docks/pilings/electrical pedestals are discovered late, causing
      safety incidents, guest complaints, and costly reactive repairs.
    - >-
      No standardized way to prioritize and schedule fixes by severity/risk,
      leading to backlog growth and missed SLAs during peak season.
    - >-
      Photo/video collected after storms or during rounds is rarely organized or
      compared over time; change detection is ad hoc.
    - >-
      Existing marina software focuses on reservations/billing; CMMS tools lack
      marina-specific asset models and vision-based detection.
    - >-
      Regulatory and insurer documentation (NFPA 303, NEC 555) is burdensome;
      evidence collection is fragmented and error-prone.
    - >-
      Maintenance labor is scarce; dispatching the right crew with the right
      parts is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Insurance claims and outages are expensive; executives lack quantified ROI
      and risk reduction metrics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Capture: Ingest video/photos from smartphones, fixed cameras, dock carts,
      drones, or action cams during routine rounds or post-storm sweeps.
    - >-
      Detect: Computer vision models identify defects on docks/pilings/pedestals
      (rot, loose boards, trip hazards, corrosion, missing caps, damaged
      cleats/fenders, GFCI/lighting issues, water leaks), classify severity, and
      geolocate to slip/asset ID.
    - >-
      Triage: Risk scoring ties severity to guest impact, electrical/fire risk,
      and regulatory mapping (NFPA 303, NEC 555) to set priority and due dates.
    - >-
      Schedule: Auto-create work orders, assign crews/contractors based on
      availability/skills/parts, and slot into calendar with SLA targets.
    - >-
      Verify: Require photo/video closure evidence; before/after comparisons and
      trend lines confirm remediation quality and prevent repeat issues.
    - >-
      Report: Compliance-ready reports, insurer packs, and operations dashboards
      tracking MTTD, MTTR, backlog, and cost savings.
    - >-
      Integrate: Two-way sync with marina management and CMMS tools; alerts via
      SMS/email/Slack/Teams; API and webhooks for custom workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, AI-powered dock infrastructure inspections that detect,
    prioritize, and automatically schedule maintenance, cutting unplanned
    outages and inspection labor while improving safety and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specialized defect dataset and models for marina infrastructure,
    coupled with closed-loop scheduling and insurer-aligned reporting. Early
    integrations with leading marina platforms and multi-site operator pilots
    create data network effects and switching costs that generic CMMS or vision
    tools lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Large marina operators (200+ slips) with multiple sites and centralized
      ops (e.g., Safe Harbor, Suntex, IGY, Westrec).
    - >-
      Municipal/port authority marinas and yacht clubs with public safety
      requirements.
    - >-
      Independent private marinas (100–500 slips) seeking labor efficiency and
      uptime.
    - >-
      Boat yards with dock infrastructure and electrical pedestals serving
      transient traffic.
    - >-
      Insurers and underwriters covering marinas seeking loss prevention data
      and discounts.
    - >-
      Maintenance contractors/divers offering inspection services who want
      value-added reporting.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to marina operators via targeted outbound to operations
      leaders and regional managers.

      ServiceTitan-like partners for contractors).
    - >-
      Drone service networks and local inspection contractors to bundle capture
      + AI analysis.
    - >-
      Insurance underwriters/brokers offering premium credits for clients
      adopting risk-reduction tech.
    - >-
