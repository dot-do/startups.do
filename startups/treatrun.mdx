  problem:
    - >-
      High variability in wood species, moisture content, and sapwood/heartwood
      ratio forces operators to overtreat to avoid assay failures, increasing
      chemical and energy costs by 8–25%.
    - >-
      Static recipes don’t adjust to charge makeup, preservative formulation, or
      ambient conditions, leading to longer-than-necessary cycles and
      underutilized cylinder capacity (10–20% lost throughput).
    - >-
      Assay and penetration failures (e.g., AWPA/EN351/CSA O80) cause costly
      re-treats, scrap, and customer claims; plants often see 2–8% re-treat
      rates.
    - >-
      Lack of real-time predictive control: PLC logic executes steps but doesn’t
      optimize vacuum/pressure/time setpoints to a target retention/penetration
      at minimal cost/time.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into run economics at the charge level; managers can’t
      quantify chemical usage per m3, energy per cycle, or ROI of process
      tweaks.
    - >-
      Skills gap and turnover: expert knowledge is tacit and operator-dependent,
      increasing variability and risk of non-compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven setpoint recommender that predicts and optimizes initial/final
      vacuum, pressure ramp, hold times, solution strength, and conditioning
      steps to achieve target retention/penetration at lowest chemical and time
      cost.
    - >-
      Closed-loop supervisory control that interfaces with PLC/SCADA to apply
      setpoints per charge; stays within user-defined safety/regulatory
      guardrails (no under-treatment allowed).
    - >-
      Charge-aware modeling: ingests species mix, dimensions, moisture content,
      sapwood/heartwood ratio, preservative concentration/temperature, and
      historical logs to tailor recipes.
    - >-
      Real-time digital twin simulates expected retention/penetration vs.
      time/pressure to avoid overrun and terminate cycles optimally.
    - >-
      Assay risk scoring and sampling plan recommendations to minimize re-treats
      and lab burden.
    - >-
      Audit-ready compliance logs with traceability of setpoints, overrides, and
      outcomes for AWPA/EN/CSA audits.
    - >-
      On-prem edge gateway for secure data collection and cloud model training
      with continuous learning across seasons/species.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Wood-treatment plant managers, operators, and QC leads who must consistently
    meet retention/penetration specs while maximizing throughput and margins.
  problem: >-
    Runs are unpredictable due to wood variability and weather; conservative
    recipes waste chemicals and time; missed specs trigger re-treats, scrap, and
    compliance risk.
  guide: >-
    Treatment Run Optimizer is an AI co-pilot for vacuum/pressure autoclaves
    that understands your standards and historical data, bringing predictability
    to retention/penetration while reducing waste and operator guesswork.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and import your retention/penetration specs. 2) Calibrate on
    recent runs to learn wood, chemical, and equipment behavior. 3) Before each
    charge, receive recommended vacuum/pressure/time setpoints and live
    adjustments to hit targets with minimal chemical use and cycle time.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and launch a two-week pilot on one cylinder to
    validate setpoints and ROI.
  success: >-
    Every run hits spec with confidence; chemical use and cycle time drop;
    throughput rises; fewer re-treats; operators get clear, auditable setpoints
    and post-run reports.
  failure: >-
    Keep over-treating to be safe, miss specs when conditions shift, burn budget
    on chemicals and energy, clog schedules with re-runs, and risk customer or
    regulatory fallout.
