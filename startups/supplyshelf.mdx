  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers juggle 5,000–50,000 SKUs with volatile, seasonal demand (e.g.,
      back-to-school spikes, calendar-year diaries) causing frequent stockouts
      and overstock.
    - >-
      Purchasing teams rely on spreadsheets or generic ERP modules that ignore
      MOQs, case-pack sizes, vendor minimums, and variable lead times—leading to
      suboptimal POs.
    - >-
      Long and inconsistent supplier lead times (imported items 6–12 weeks;
      domestic 2–4 weeks) are not forecasted, inflating safety stock or risking
      backorders.
    - >-
      Capital is tied up in slow-moving inventory (10–25% excess), while fill
      rates lag (typically 90–95% vs 97–98% target), hurting key account SLAs.
    - >-
      Promotion and contract pricing events are not systematically factored into
      forecasts, causing either missed sales or margin-dilutive clearance.
    - >-
      New items and cannibalization are guessed at, producing high initial buys
      and write-offs.
    - >-
      Planning is labor-intensive; a single planner can only manage 3,000–5,000
      SKUs effectively, delaying decisions and increasing errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from ERPs (e.g., Epicor Prophet 21, NetSuite, SAP
      Business One, Dynamics 365 BC, Sage 100/300) and EDI sales/PO history;
      daily updates.
    - >-
      Hierarchical AI forecasting at SKU-DC-week level with seasonality
      (back-to-school, tax season), holidays, promotions, and contract effects;
      bias correction and intermittent-demand methods for slow movers.
    - >-
      Lead-time forecasting using supplier/route history and variability, with
      dynamic safety stock to hit target service levels (e.g., 97–98%).
    - >-
      Purchase suggestion engine that respects MOQs, case packs, vendor
      minimums/MOV, truckload/pallet rounding, and multi-ship window
      constraints; auto-create POs for ERP approval.
    - >-
      ABC/XYZ segmentation and service-level policies by segment/customer
      importance; budget-aware buying with what-if simulations.
    - >-
      New-item forecasting via analogs/attribute matching; cannibalization
      alerts when similar SKUs overlap.
    - >-
      Dashboards for forecast accuracy (WAPE/MAPE), bias, fill rate, DOH, turns,
      and capital tied up; exception-based workflow that highlights only SKUs
      needing attention.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop overrides with reason codes; audit trail for planners
      and CFO sign-off.
    - >-
      Supplier scorecards: OTIF, lead-time drift, fill-rate trends, and
      cost-to-serve insights.
    - >-
      Deployment in 4–8 weeks; SOC 2-ready architecture; APIs/EDI for
      closed-loop PO creation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SKU-week forecasts that auto-convert into optimal, constraint-aware purchase
    suggestions—meeting target service levels while reducing working capital
    10–25% and improving fill rate 1–3 points—purpose-built for office supplies’
    seasonality, pack sizes, and vendor constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific models and constraints (BTS seasonality, case-pack logic,
    vendor MOVs), plus ready-to-deploy ERP/EDI connectors enabling 4–8 week
    time-to-value and closed-loop PO automation—reducing planner workload and
    capital simultaneously. Early network benchmarks provide privacy-preserving
    lead-time and service-level baselines unique to office supplies.

    office‑supplies wholesalers who want accurate SKU‑week forecasts and
    actionable purchase suggestions to hit service levels with less working
    capital and less manual work.

    - External: Volatile SKU demand, long/variable supplier lead times, strict
    MOQs, seasonality (back‑to‑school), promotions, and spreadsheet‑driven
    planning.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting, low trust in numbers, and time wasted
    building/adjusting POs.

    - Philosophical: Buying inventory shouldn’t be a gamble—every order should
    be defensible and data‑driven.
  guide: >-

    thousands of SKUs; respects MOQs, lead times, and service levels; integrates
    with common ERPs; secure and auditable.

    spreadsheets.

    - Confident orders aligned to seasons, promotions, and supplier calendars.

    - Happier customers and healthier cash flow.
