leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Siding contractors lose 2–6 labor hours per job navigating permits/HOA
      approvals, delaying install dates and cash flow.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction and HOA requirements vary widely (forms, drawings,
      signatures, fees, portals), causing rejections and resubmittals.
    - >-
      Small/mid-sized contractors lack dedicated permit coordinators; owners or
      PMs context-switch, reducing close rates and crew utilization.
    - >-
      Storm/replacement spikes overwhelm admin capacity; inconsistent packaging
      leads to lower first-pass approval rates (<70% in many markets).
    - >-
      Contractors’ CRMs/estimating tools (HOVER, EagleView, JobNimbus) don’t
      produce jurisdiction-ready submittal packages.
    - >-
      HOA subjectivity (color, profile, material rules) generates preventable
      rejections due to missing samples or misaligned guidelines.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven requirement engine maps address to jurisdiction and HOA rules
      and auto-fills official forms.
    - >-
      Auto-assembled drawing set (site plan, elevations, material schedule,
      colors) from HOVER/EagleView/CompanyCam and your scope.
    - >-
      Concierge review (human-in-the-loop) with SLA and resubmittal handling to
      hit first-pass targets.
    - >-
      Submission tracker: pays fees, uploads via municipal portals, mails HOA
      packets when needed; status + notifications.
    - >-
      “Redline Resolver” bot parses rejection notes and proposes exact
      corrections; 1-click regenerate and resubmit.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, jurisdiction-correct permit and HOA submittals for siding.
    24-hour turnaround (managed), 90%+ first-pass permit acceptance, 85% HOA
    first-pass, integrated with HOVER/EagleView/JobNimbus—so crews start sooner
    and office spends minutes, not hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, siding-specific acceptance dataset (jurisdiction +
    HOA) powering a knowledge graph and redline resolver, coupled with deep
    integrations (HOVER/CompanyCam/JobNimbus) that competitors in generic
    permitting lack. Network effects: each accepted package improves future
    first-pass accuracy in that micro-jurisdiction/HOA.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary ICP: Small–mid siding contractors (3–30 crews) doing 80–300
      jobs/year; limited or no in-house permitting staff.

      standardized submittals.

      material pull-through.

      AccuLynx) app listings and co-webinars.
