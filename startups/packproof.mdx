  title: Tech Pack QA & BOM Builder
  description: >-
    AI agent that reviews uploaded tech packs, flags missing details, and
    auto-builds a structured BOM with assumptions for quick costing and
    sourcing.
  targetUsers:
    - Technical Designer
    - Product Developer
    - Merchandiser

    - New tech pack uploaded to PLM/Drive
    - RFQ received via email
  inputs:
    - Tech pack PDF/Images
    - Sketches/Construction notes
    - Initial measurement chart
    - Proto/sample comments (if any)
  steps:
    - Ingest files via secure link/email intake
    - 'OCR and parse components, construction, stitches, trims'
    - 'Detect gaps (e.g., seam allowances, SPI, label placements, packaging)'
    - Assemble draft BOM with UOMs and supplier placeholders
    - Estimate fabric consumption from standard yield tables by fabric type/fit
    - Generate assumptions log and questions list
    - Route for optional human review and finalize outputs
  tools:
    - OpenAI GPT-4o (text+vision)
    - AWS Textract
    - Python/Pandas
    - Google Sheets/Excel API
    - Zapier/Make for intake
  outputs:
    - Clean tech pack summary (CSV/Excel)
    - Structured BOM (CSV/Excel)
    - Missing info checklist & assumptions
    - Ready-to-share RFQ packet (PDF)
  pricingModel:

  risks:
    - Ambiguous/low-quality tech packs cause wrong assumptions
    - Consumption is estimate without patterns
    - IP sensitivity of style data
  dependencies:
    - Access to PLM/Drive
    - Standardized BOM taxonomy
    - Style library for yield lookup
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Incomplete or ambiguous tech packs lead to 2–5 days of RFQ delays and 3–6
      rounds of email back-and-forth between brand PD/TD and factory costing
      teams.
    - >-
      Manual BOM creation takes 1–3 hours per style and is error-prone; missing
      trims, stitch types, or tolerances trigger rework and sample rejection
      rates of 5–10%.
    - >-
      Costing variance is high: initial quotes vs. final cost differ by 5–15%
      due to unclear specs (fabric GSM, shrinkage, finishes, packaging).
    - >-
      Lack of standardization across categories (knits, denim, outerwear) and
      regions causes inconsistent documentation; new hires need 2–4 weeks to
      learn “house rules.”
    - >-
      PLM/BOM tools exist but rely on manual data entry; QA checklists are
      static and not enforced at upload, allowing poor data quality into
      downstream systems.
    - >-
      Factories and vertically integrated manufacturers struggle to quickly
      triage large volumes of RFQs; English-only or unstructured formats (PDF,
      AI/PSD, Excel) slow intake.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI QA engine that parses PDFs/Illustrator/Excel tech packs, identifies
      missing or conflicting details (e.g., fabric GSM, stitch type per seam,
      label placements), and proposes fixes.
    - >-
      Auto-BOM builder that normalizes components (fabric, trims, packaging)
      into a structured schema, with cost-driving assumptions clearly labeled
      and editable.
    - >-
      Category-specific rulebooks (knits, wovens, denim, outerwear, activewear,
      intimates) that enforce completeness standards and tolerances at upload.
    - >-
      Supplier-ready exports to PLM/ERP (Centric, FlexPLM, WFX, Techpacker, SAP)
      and RFQ pack assembly in one click.
    - >-
      Version diffing and change impact analysis to highlight cost/lead-time
      implications per revision.
    - >-
      Lightweight cost estimator using regional labor rates, MOQs, waste
      factors, and yield assumptions for fast quote ballparks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy tech packs into production-ready, standardized specs in minutes.
    PackProof flags missing details, auto-builds a structured BOM with
    transparent assumptions, and exports to PLM/ERP—cutting RFQ cycle time by
    50–70% and reducing costing variance by 5–10%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific QA rulebooks and BOM ontology built with tech design SMEs,
    reinforced by a growing proprietary dataset from real brand/factory
    workflows. Tight PLM integrations and an assumption-transparency engine
    (with confidence scoring and audit logs) create switching costs and enable
    continuous model improvement unavailable to generic document AI or manual
    PLM workflows.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Product developers, technical designers, and production managers at
    cut-and-sew apparel brands and manufacturers who need complete specs and
    fast, standardized BOMs for costing and sourcing.
  problem: >-
    Incomplete or inconsistent tech packs force manual QA and hand-built BOMs,
    delaying costing, creating errors, driving rework, and straining vendor
    relationships.
  guide: >-
    We know how a single missing spec can blow a calendar. Built by apparel ops
    and AI experts, trained on industry standards and real BOM patterns, and
    focused on reducing QA time and quote variance.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload tech packs (PDF/XLSX/PLM export). 2) AI flags gaps, risks, and
    proposes assumptions. 3) Approve edits and export a structured, versioned
    BOM (CSV/PLM/API) for immediate costing.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 2-week pilot with 10 tech packs. Or request a sample QA/BOM report
    and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Factory-ready tech packs, standardized BOMs, faster and more accurate
    quotes, fewer sample rounds, tighter cost control, shorter calendars, and
    stronger vendor trust.
  failure: >-
    Teams stay stuck in manual checks, pay for preventable changes, miss buy
    windows, overbuy materials, lose margin, and erode vendor trust.
