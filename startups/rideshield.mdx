leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      24/7 incident load overwhelms safety teams: medium-to-large ride platforms
      receive 200–2,000 safety-related tickets/day across chat, email, phone,
      in-app forms; off-hours response times exceed 30–90 minutes, increasing
      harm and liability.
    - >-
      Manual triage is slow and inconsistent: first-pass classification averages
      6–20 minutes per case; policy mapping varies by agent and region, driving
      uneven decisions and rework.
    - >-
      High-severity under-triage risk: false negatives on severe cases (assault,
      DUIs, threats) expose platforms to regulatory fines, lawsuits, and
      reputational damage.
    - >-
      Evidence fragmentation: audio transcripts, GPS, trip metadata, chat logs,
      and prior reports live in different systems; assembling an evidence pack
      can take 20–45 minutes and often omits key context.
    - >-
      Language and localization gaps: cross-border operations see 30–60% of
      reports in non-English; translation delays slow action and create quality
      issues.
    - >-
      Cost pressure: safety operations are a major OPEX line item; BPO or
      in-house staffing scales linearly with trips, with limited automation.
    - >-
      Compliance exposure: GDPR/CCPA data handling, regulator-mandated
      reporting, and auditability are hard to meet with ad hoc processes.
    - >-
      Fraud/noise: 10–30% of “safety” reports are actually refunds/complaints;
      teams waste time sorting non-safety items.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified intake of safety reports from in-app forms, chat, email, and phone
      (ASR) with real-time translation and PII redaction.
    - >-
      Policy-aware severity classification and risk scoring mapped to each
      customer’s playbooks and jurisdictions.
    - >-
      Automated actions via API: temporary account freeze/safe-mode, geofenced
      restrictions, incident acknowledgement messaging, and queue routing to
      on-call humans for severity ≥3.
    - >-
      Automated evidence pack creation: stitch trip metadata (GPS, speed,
      timestamps), account history, comms transcripts, media attachments, prior
      incidents, and policy rationale; export to PDF/JSON with immutable audit
      hash.
    - >-
      Escalation workflows: notify duty manager/legal; push to case systems
      (Zendesk, Salesforce, ServiceNow) with priority and SLA; auto-schedule
      wellness checks where applicable.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop: post-resolution labels feed model retraining
      with bias/accuracy monitoring and region/policy versioning.
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: SOC 2 Type II/ISO 27001, GDPR/CCPA controls,
      data residency options, audit logs, and retention policies configurable by
      region.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-first, mobility-specific safety triage that acts in minutes, not hours:
    auto-classifies severity, freezes accounts per policy, compiles
    regulator-ready evidence packs, and escalates to the right human
    fast—cutting triage cost by 30–50% and reducing time-to-first-action by
    60–90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mobility-specific safety ontology and policy engine trained on
    cross-operator, multilingual incident data with regulator-aligned evidence
    packaging—combined with audited auto-freeze workflows and deep integrations
    to dispatch systems that general-purpose CX or T&S tools lack.
