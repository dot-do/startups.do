leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      R&D and technical consulting teams need rapid, reliable patent landscape
      and freedom-to-operate (FTO) triage to inform strategy without
      commissioning full legal opinions for every idea.
    - >-
      Existing patent search tools are either too generic (high noise, low
      recall for domain-specific queries) or too complex/expensive for
      mid-market consultancies and SMEs.
    - >-
      Manual keyword/classification searches miss semantically similar prior
      art; teams lack AI-driven clustering and risk signals to prioritize
      counsel time.
    - >-
      Legal budgets are strained: outside-counsel FTO can cost $10k–$50k per
      project and take weeks; teams need a 24–72 hour, sub-$5k triage step to
      decide whether to proceed.
    - >-
      Non-legal risk: teams need clear, auditable, and defensible non-legal
      workflows and red-flag criteria to avoid unauthorized legal practice while
      still producing actionable insights.
  solution:
    - >-
      Semantic, domain-tuned prior-art search across global patent corpora with
      high recall@N and transparent citations.
    - >-
      Automatic clustering and mapping of results to CPC/IPC, assignees,
      geographies, and timelines to reveal whitespace and competitor positions.
    - >-
      Rule-based and ML-driven red-flag identification (claims similarity,
      assignee litigiousness, legal status, family breadth) with adjustable
      thresholds per risk profile.
    - >-
      Standardized, non-legal FTO triage workflows and report templates with
      auditable rationale, disclaimers, and export to counsel.
    - >-
      Integrations with common research tools (CSV, PPTX, Confluence,
      SharePoint) and secure deployment options (VPC/on-prem).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-first, non-legal patent landscape and FTO triage in hours, not weeks:
    high-recall semantic search, auto-clustering, and red-flag scoring with
    transparent evidence, enabling consultants and R&D teams to prioritize
    designs and outside counsel spend while maintaining clear non-legal
    boundaries.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, audited benchmark suite and labeled corpus for claim-level
    similarity and red-flag triage across multiple technical domains, coupled
    with defensible non-legal workflows and governance. This enables faster,
    higher-recall triage with transparent evidence and reduces counsel
    rework—capabilities difficult for generalist tools to replicate without
    domain-specific labels and process IP.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Scientific and technical consulting firms, R&D leaders, and product
    strategists who need a clear, current patent landscape and early FTO red
    flags to de-risk product and market decisions.
  problem: >-
    External: Patent data is fragmented, time-consuming to search, and
    competitors file fast. Internal: Teams worry they’ll miss blocking claims
    and make costly moves. Philosophical: Smart innovation shouldn’t hinge on
    weeks of manual sifting or guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the uncertainty of navigating dense patent data under tight
    timelines. Our AI-assisted workflow and domain analysts deliver transparent
    clusters, similarity hits, and red-flag insights to guide strategy—clearly
    and quickly. Note: This is decision support, not a legal opinion.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Scope intake (tech, jurisdictions, timeframe). 2) AI search,
    clustering, and assignee mapping. 3) Red-flag screening with claim excerpts
    and heatmaps. 4) Review call with recommendations and next steps. Agreement:
    confidentiality by default; non-legal, non-opinion service; optional handoff
    package for counsel.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute scope call to start your scan this week.
    Transitional: Download a sample report and methodology brief; request a
    pilot on one focus area.
  success: >-
    You gain a fast, visual map of the art, key players, and risk hotspots;
    prioritized red flags; white-space and partnership cues; clearer go/no-go
    decisions; better-aligned R&D roadmaps; investor- and counsel-ready
    materials; reduced time and cost.
  failure: >-
    Avoid late-stage infringement surprises, wasted R&D in crowded claim areas,
    missed white-space, delayed launches, negative diligence findings, and
    reputation risk from weak IP awareness.
