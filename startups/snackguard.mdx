  problem:
    - >-
      Detecting quality drifts (oil degradation, seasoning variance,
      moisture/texture, seal integrity) hours or days late leads to
      scrap/rework, retailer chargebacks, and brand-damaging complaints.
    - >-
      Manual QA logs are sparse, inconsistent, and lagging; SPC charts are
      static and miss multivariate and intermittent issues.
    - >-
      OT data (PLCs/SCADA/historians), QA logs, and vision systems are siloed;
      no single view to trigger early holds, root-cause analysis, or
      recipe-aware baselines.
    - >-
      Net weight giveaway and underfill both slip through due to slow checks and
      threshold-only alarms; regulatory and customer penalties ensue.
    - >-
      Changeovers introduce high risk (allergen cross-contact, seasoning
      carryover, label mismatch); current checks are manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Existing vision systems catch hard defects but miss subtle drifts (e.g.,
      seasoning coverage, oil darkening) and lack trend awareness.
    - >-
      Complaint rates are not systematically tied back to process conditions;
      plants struggle to prevent recurrence and quantify COPQ.
    - >-
      Corporate wants multi-plant benchmarking and standardized SPC discipline,
      but plant-by-plant tools and data schemas block scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline: connectors to historians (OSIsoft/AVEVA PI,
      Ignition, Canary), PLCs via OPC UA/Kepware, QA/LIMS data, and vision
      systems (Cognex, Keyence).
    - >-
      Real-time SPC with classical rules (Western Electric/Nelson), EWMA/CUSUM,
      and multivariate anomaly detection (isolation forest, PCA/PLS, Bayesian
      change-point).
    - >-
      Snack-specific vision AI for seasoning coverage, color/oil darkening, seal
      integrity, inclusion/foreign matter, and pack geometry using edge-deployed
      models.
    - >-
      Recipe- and equipment-aware baselining that auto-adjusts control limits
      across SKUs, shifts, and environmental conditions.
    - >-
      Root-cause and drift attribution with feature importance, correlation to
      raw-material lots, and guided corrective actions; auto-generate CAPAs.
    - >-
      Alerting and workflows: Andon/Teams/SMS alerts, hold-and-release
      integration with MES/QMS, optional auto-adjust setpoints within
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Complaint triage: correlate consumer complaints/retailer returns with
      historical process states to prevent recurrence and quantify savings.
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: audit trails, model versioning, validation
      protocols, and electronic records supporting SQF/BRCGS audits.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: cloud + edge gateway with sub-second inference;
      on-prem for air-gapped plants; SOC 2/ISO 27001 aligned.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect and act on process drifts and defects early by fusing QA logs, OT
    sensor streams, and images into real-time SPC with snack-specific AI
    models—cutting COPQ by 20–40% and complaints by 25–50% within 90 days, while
    aligning with HACCP/FSMA and GFSI audit expectations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A library of snack-specific, multi-plant pre-trained models and SPC
    templates (seasoning, oil/color, seal quality, net weight) plus ready-made
    connectors and HACCP-aligned workflows that deliver measurable savings in
    weeks—not months—validated across multiple snack categories; combined with
    edge-capable, low-latency deployments and audit-ready governance.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant, Ops, and QA leaders in snack food manufacturing who need every run in
    spec—seasoning coverage, moisture/aw, net weight, and seal integrity—so
    customers stay happy and lines stay efficient.
  problem: >-
    Small drifts hide across QA logs, sensors, and images. Manual SPC and siloed
    data miss multivariate patterns, so defects surface late—causing rework,
    waste, chargebacks, and audit stress. Quality should be predictable, not a
    firefight.
  guide: >-
    We’re an AI + SPC team dedicated to food plants, with snack manufacturing
    know‑how. We deliver secure, IT‑friendly deployments and FSMA/GFSI‑ready
    practices that turn plant data into reliable early warning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate QA logs, line sensors, and vision systems. 2)
    Calibrate: Train and validate drift/anomaly models on historical runs and
    golden batches. 3) Go Live: Real‑time alerts with root‑cause hints, operator
    workflows, and dashboards; iterate with weekly CI reviews.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30‑minute demo and launch a low‑risk pilot on one line
    within 2 weeks. Secondary: Download the data readiness checklist and ROI
    worksheet.
  success: >-
    Proactive quality: stable processes, higher first‑pass yield, fewer
    complaints, faster investigations, stronger Cp/Cpk, and confident
    audits—across every shift and SKU.
  failure: >-
    Without early warning, you keep firefighting—scrap, rework, overtime, late
    CAPAs, missed shipments, retailer penalties, and potential recalls.
