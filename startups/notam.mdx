  title: NOTAM-to-Operational Impact Assistant
  description: >-
    Advisory engine that parses new NOTAMs and quantifies operational impact on
    runways, procedures, navaids, and sector flows; generates succinct shift
    briefs and suggested mitigations.

    - AIXM airport data
    - Local SOP/LOA library
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      NOTAM overload and ambiguity: Supervisors and TMU sift through dozens to
      hundreds of daily NOTAMs per facility; impacts to runways/procedures/flows
      are not explicit and require manual cross-referencing.
    - >-
      Slow, inconsistent shift briefs: Building a coherent, actionable briefing
      from NOTAMs, weather, and traffic constraints can take 10–20 minutes per
      shift and varies by individual experience.
    - >-
      Missed or late mitigations: Operational impacts (e.g., a glide slope
      outage that reduces arrival rate in IMC) may be identified late, causing
      unplanned miles-in-trail (MIT), sector overloads, or taxi gridlock.
    - >-
      Poor traceability: Facilities lack a standardized, auditable link between
      specific NOTAMs and actual capacity/flow decisions taken.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: NOTAM boards, IDS, weather, and TFMS/flight data are
      disjointed; controllers and TMU must mentally fuse them under time
      pressure.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize NOTAMs (AIXM 5.1), map to local assets (runways,
      taxiways, SIDs/STARs, approaches, navaids, sectors).
    - >-
      Impact engine quantifies capacity and flow effects (e.g., AAR/ADR deltas,
      sector complexity changes) using rules + ML calibrated per facility.
    - >-
      Context fusion with weather (IWXXM), scheduled closures, and traffic
      demand (TFMS/SWIM) to simulate scenarios and suggest mitigations (e.g.,
      runway config change, MIT values, reroute options).
    - >-
      Auto-generate succinct, role-specific shift briefs; highlight new/changed
      NOTAMs and what-to-do-next items.
    - >-
      Alerting and watch lists for high-impact NOTAMs; early warnings before
      effective times; deconfliction and conflict detection (overlapping
      closures/procedure dependencies).
    - >-
      Integrations with IDS/EDST/ATM decision-support tools via secure APIs;
      audit trail linking NOTAM -> decision -> outcome.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn raw NOTAMs into quantified, facility-specific operational impacts with
    recommended mitigations—auto-generating consistent, auditable shift briefs
    in minutes, improving predictability, safety margin, and throughput.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of NOTAM-to-impact labels and mitigation
    outcomes across diverse facilities, integrated into IDS/ATM vendor
    ecosystems and supported by a documented safety case and validation metrics,
    creating high switching costs and regulatory trust.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    ATC supervisors, traffic management coordinators, and ops managers at
    towers, TRACONs, and en-route centers (NAICS 488111) who want immediate,
    quantified NOTAM impacts on runways, procedures, navaids, and sector flows
    to keep operations safe, efficient, and predictable.
  problem: >-
    - External — Continuous stream of NOTAMs in inconsistent formats; unclear
    operational impact; manual cross-referencing across runways, procedures,
    navaids, and flows; late discovery drives last-minute reconfigs and delays.

    - Internal — Overwhelmed and time-pressed; worry about missing a critical
    restriction; low confidence in shift briefs during push periods.

    - Philosophical — Safety-critical teams deserve clear, actionable
    intelligence, not walls of all-caps text, so decisions are proactive and
    data-driven.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy — We’ve lived the midnight NOTAM drop and morning launch: navaid
    outages, runway closures, taxiway work, TFRs, and procedure notes that
    ripple across sectors.

    - Authority — Built by ATM engineers and former controllers/NOTAM
    specialists; uses AIXM parsing and FAA FNS feeds; validated with facility
    SMEs; secure, auditable outputs designed for 488111 environments.
  plan: >-
    - Process — 1) Connect your NOTAM feed and facility config (runways,
    procedures, sector map). 2) AI quantifies operational impacts and proposes
    mitigations. 3) Receive shift briefs, alerts, and export to existing tools.

    - Agreement — Start with a low-risk pilot on a subset of airports/sectors;
    read-only integration with admin controls; clear SLAs, data handling, and
    opt-out anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct — Schedule a live demo and launch a 30-day pilot.

    - Transitional — Download a sample shift brief and request a free NOTAM
    impact audit for the last 30 days.
  success: >-
    - Confident, consistent shift briefs focused on true impacts.

    - Earlier mitigations for configs, staffing, and reroutes with fewer
    surprises.

    - Shared situational awareness across tower/TRACON/center and TMU.

    - Reduced briefing and coordination time; less rework and radio congestion.

    - Defensible, auditable decision support that strengthens safety and
    compliance.
  failure: >-
    - Missed or late-discovered NOTAM effects cause last-minute config changes,
    sector overload, and delays.

    - Inconsistent shift briefs and handoffs create confusion and extra
    workload.

    - Erosion of stakeholder trust and elevated operational risk.
