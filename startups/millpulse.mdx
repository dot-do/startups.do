leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Paper mills experience high unplanned downtime from rotating equipment
      (pumps, refiners, fans, motors, gearboxes) due to undetected degradation
      and late interventions.
    - >-
      Existing vibration programs are often route-based and reactive; process
      and electrical data are underused, causing missed early warnings and false
      alarms.
    - >-
      Reliability teams are overloaded; raw alerts from disparate systems lack
      prioritization and clear, actionable next steps.
    - >-
      Mills struggle to justify predictive maintenance ROI because alerts are
      not tied to risk, production impact, or recommended actions and work
      orders.
    - >-
      Integration across DCS/PLC, historians, CMMS, and sensor systems is
      complex, slowing adoption and value realization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy edge gateway to ingest vibration (continuous or route-based), motor
      current, and process tags via OPC UA/Modbus/MQTT/PI Web API.
    - >-
      Fuse signals with physics-informed ML models and asset libraries for
      pumps/refiners/fans/motors/gearboxes; auto-baseline per grade/run state.
    - >-
      Calculate asset-level Risk of Failure (0–100) and Estimated
      Time-to-Intervention (ETTI) with confidence bands; update every 5–15
      minutes.
    - >-
      Generate prioritized triage queue by area/line, with recommended actions
      (inspect, balance, alignment, bearing change) and links to likely failure
      modes.
    - >-
      Integrate with CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo/eMaint) to auto-create work orders with
      spare parts/BOM suggestions and target windows (planned outages).
    - >-
      Deliver explainable alerts (what changed, which signals contributed) via
      web/mobile and route to Teams/Slack/email; track action outcomes to learn.
    - >-
      Run 8–12 week pilot on one process area, prove reductions in nuisance
      alarms and early catches, then scale plant-wide and to sister mills.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven triage that continuously fuses vibration, motor current, and
    process data to rank risk of failure and recommend clear, CMMS-ready
    actions—cutting unplanned downtime 15–30% on monitored rotating assets
    within 6–9 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific, physics-informed models and multi-signal fusion tuned for
    pulp/paper duty cycles, plus outcome-linked action playbooks integrated to
    CMMS; growing proprietary dataset of labeled paper-mill failures and
    process-context events that generalist PdM tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Reliability and maintenance leaders at paper mills who must keep pumps,
    refiners, fans, motors, and gearboxes running without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External — critical rotating equipment fails unpredictably and condition
    data (vibration, motor current, process tags) is noisy and siloed. Internal
    — teams drown in alarms and work orders, guessing priorities and missing
    early warnings. Philosophical — keeping fiber moving shouldn’t depend on
    luck or heroics; it should be predictable.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill fire drills and the pressure of 24/7 production. Our team
    blends mill veterans and certified condition-monitoring experts with AI that
    turns raw signals into clear risk and actionable recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect — securely ingest vibration, current, and process data from
    existing sensors and historians. 2) Calibrate — map assets, learn baselines,
    and set risk thresholds with your team. 3) Triage & act — get a daily ranked
    risk list with recommended actions (inspect, align, balance, lubricate,
    replace), evidence, and follow-up tracking.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute demo; start a 90‑day pilot on a critical area to prove
    value.
  success: >-
    Maintenance focuses on the right machines at the right time; fewer surprises
    and safer shifts; clear, defensible priorities; improved OEE and energy use;
    reduced overtime and emergency spend; tribal knowledge captured in
    actionable playbooks.
  failure: >-
    Unplanned outages keep disrupting production; alarms and work orders pile
    up; bearings and seals fail unnoticed; emergency repairs, overtime, and lost
    tons erode margins; talent burns out and know-how walks out the door.
