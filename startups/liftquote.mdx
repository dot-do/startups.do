leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ intake is messy and time-consuming: quotes take 1–5 business days to
      draft due to manual parsing of PDFs/emails, spreadsheets, drawings, and
      specs.
    - >-
      High labor cost and bottlenecks: quoting engineers spend 3–8 hours per
      RFQ, limiting throughput and slowing response times that hurt win rates.
    - >-
      Specification errors and omissions: missed constraints (CMAA class, span,
      headroom, environment, duty cycle) cause rework, change orders, and margin
      leakage (1–3% per order).
    - >-
      Inconsistent clarifying questions: sales teams forget to ask critical
      questions (power, crane service class, runway condition, controls,
      below-the-hook devices), causing delays and misquotes.
    - >-
      Pricing and lead-time inaccuracies: outdated price lists and vendor lead
      times cause over/under quoting, missed revenue, and on-time delivery
      issues.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: insufficient checks against OSHA/ASME/CMAA requirements
      lead to costly redesigns and reputational harm.
    - >-
      Poor data reuse: lessons from win/loss and historical quotes aren’t
      systematically captured to improve speed, accuracy, and margin over time.
    - >-
      RFQ triage is ad hoc: high-value projects don’t get prioritized, small
      opportunities consume bandwidth, and SLAs slip without visibility.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from email inboxes, portals, and CRMs; normalize files (PDF,
      DOCX, XLSX, images); OCR and classify into opportunity types (new crane,
      modernization, hoist-only, runway/system).
    - >-
      Extract structured requirements: capacity, span, lift, headroom, CMAA
      class, duty cycle, environment (temp, dust, hazardous), power, speeds,
      controls, below-the-hook, site constraints, certifications.
    - >-
      Parametric configuration engine: propose crane/hoist architectures
      (single/double girder, top-running/under-running), trolley selection, end
      trucks, drives, electrification (festoon/conductor bar), controls, and
      options guided by CMAA 70/74 and OEM rules.
    - >-
      BOM generation with cost build-up: consume supplier catalogs and internal
      costing (steel, fabrication, machining, paint, assembly, FAT, install,
      freight) including labor standards and overhead/margin guardrails.
    - >-
      Pricing and lead-time engine: apply price lists, discount structures,
      regional multipliers, and supplier lead times; flag risky components and
      long poles.
    - >-
      Clarifying questions module: produce a prioritized question set by
      confidence gaps (power supply, runway condition, duty, ambient conditions,
      below-the-hook devices, site access), track responses, and update the
      quote.
    - >-
      Compliance and feasibility checks: verify span/headroom constraints, wheel
      loads/runway assumptions, safety devices, and documentation requirements
      to reduce rework and risk.
    - >-
      Quote document builder: create customer-ready proposals with technical
      description, BOM summary, exclusions, options, pricing, and terms; push to
      CRM/ERP/CPQ for workflow and approvals.
    - >-
      Analytics and triage dashboard: rank RFQs by value/fit/urgency, track SLA
      timers, visualize hit rate and margin by segment, and surface
      continuous-improvement insights.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP (Epicor/Infor/ECI/SAP/NetSuite), CPQ, CRM
      (Salesforce/HubSpot), PLM/CAD (SolidWorks/DriveWorks), and supplier
      portals to sync catalogs and lead times.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Draft compliant, priced crane/hoist quotes in under 60 minutes with 90%+
    field-extraction accuracy, built-in CMAA/ASME checks, current vendor lead
    times, and auto-generated clarifying questions—cutting quote cycle time by
    70%, reducing errors, and improving win rate and margin.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, domain-specific configuration and rules engine trained on
    anonymized crane/hoist RFQs and win/loss outcomes; continuously improving
    catalogs and lead-time data via OEM/dealer partnerships; deep integrations
    into industry ERPs/CPQs and CAD; and a curated clarifying-question knowledge
    base that captures institutional know-how—hard for generalist CPQ or
    horizontal AI tools to replicate.
