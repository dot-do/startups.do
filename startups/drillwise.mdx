    - Hole tolerances and plating allowances
    - 'Router bit availability, min web/bridge'
  steps:
    - Parse tool tables and classify PTH/NPTH/slots

    overall: 8.5
  risks:
    - Over-aggressive tool merging causing OOT holes
    - 'Missing special processes (reaming, countersink)'
    - Router path not reflecting fixture constraints
  dependencies:
    - Hole tolerance policy and plating targets
    - Router/drill machine constraints
    - Fixture/holding approach
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Excessive drill/router tool counts increase tool changeovers and cycle
      time by 5–20% per panel without improving quality.
    - >-
      Manual NC program cleanup in CAM (Genesis/InCAM/UCAM/CAM350) is
      time-consuming (15–60 minutes per job) and inconsistent between
      programmers and shifts.
    - >-
      Tolerance-unsafe consolidation attempts risk scrap due to violated
      finished-hole size, plating allowance, or minimum annular ring
      requirements.
    - >-
      Routing paths are often suboptimal (long non-cut travel, redundant passes,
      inefficient entry/exit), adding 20–90 seconds per panel on routers/mills.
    - >-
      Machine kinematic constraints (accel/jerk, spindle life, stick-out, drill
      stack heights) are not modeled during CAM prep, reducing achievable feed
      rates.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop feedback from drill/router logs prevents continuous
      improvement; shops cannot quantify tool-count decisions’ impact on OEE and
      cost.
    - >-
      Fragmented formats (Excellon, Sieb & Meyer, NC code variants) and machine
      post differences cause errors and rework at the press/shop floor.
  solution:
    - >-
      Import and normalize NC drill/route data (Excellon, Sieb & Meyer,
      machine-specific NC, IPC-2581) and link to CAM job rules and stack-up.
    - >-
      Tolerance-aware tool consolidation engine: clusters hole diameters within
      class rules, finished-hole tolerances, plating compensation, and annular
      ring constraints; generates a validated tool table.
    - >-
      Routing path optimizer: minimizes non-cut travel, optimizes plunge points,
      orders profiles, and sets tab routes to reduce cycle time without
      violating keep-outs or tab requirements.
    - >-
      Machine-specific post and digital twin: simulates kinematics (spindle
      accel/decels, drill peck strategies, retracts) to predict cycle time and
      verify no dwell/collision issues.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingests drill/router logs (actual cycle time, tool
      life, breakage events) to refine consolidation thresholds and feeds/speeds
      per material/tool class.
    - >-
      Automatic DRC checks: annular ring, breakout risk, backdrill conflicts,
      via class rules, layer registration; produces an auditable compliance
      report for QA.
    - >-
      One-click publish to shop floor: generates per-machine NC with version
      control, traveler annotations, and rollback; integrates with MES/ERP job
      travelers.
    - >-
      Optional on-prem appliance or VPC for ITAR/controlled data; APIs and
      plug-ins for Genesis/UCAM/CAM350 to fit existing workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven NC drill/route rationalization that safely consolidates tool
    tables and shortens machine cycle time by 8–15% per panel, guaranteed
    tolerance compliance (finished-hole, plating allowance, annular ring), and
    seamless handoff to existing CAM and drill/router machines — delivering
    payback in under 60 days for most sites.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A tolerance-first optimization engine that fuses finished-hole/class rules,
    plating allowances, annular ring and breakout checks with machine-specific
    kinematics — trained on cross-fab logs — producing measurable cycle-time
    reductions with an auditable compliance report. Deep integrations with
    dominant CAM tools and validated posts create high switching costs and
    defensible performance deltas.
