leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Preparers spend 1–3 hours per return on intake (organizers, emails,
      chasing docs), lowering effective hourly rates and compressing busy-season
      capacity.
    - >-
      Clients often submit incomplete or misclassified documents, causing 2–6
      follow-ups and cycle-time delays of 1–3 weeks.
    - >-
      Prior-year returns are underutilized; firms rarely use them to
      pre-populate personalized checklists at scale due to manual effort.
    - >-
      Document security and compliance risks exist in email-based intake (GLBA,
      IRS Pub 4557/1075) and non-auditable workflows.
    - >-
      Existing portals/organizers are static, not dynamic; they don’t adapt to
      each client’s life changes or detect missing items from last year.
    - >-
      Managers lack real-time visibility into intake bottlenecks by preparer,
      entity type, or client segment to rebalance work.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automatically parse prior-year returns (e.g., 1040 + Schedules, 1065,
      1120S, K-1s) to create a personalized organizer and dynamic document
      checklist per client.
    - >-
      Securely request documents via branded portal, email, and SMS with
      adaptive reminders; clients can upload from mobile or desktop.
    - >-
      Classify and extract documents (W-2, 1099, 1098, 5498, K-1, brokerage
      statements, receipts) to the right client, entity, and tax year; detect
      duplicates and stale-year docs.
    - >-
      Identify missing items from last year’s sources (e.g., expected K-1s,
      1099-INT payers) and automatically chase with clear, plain-language asks;
      support bilingual (EN/ES) messaging.
    - >-
      Provide preparer dashboards with real-time intake status, bottleneck
      alerts, and SLA-driven queues; deliver auditable trails for compliance.
    - >-
      Integrate with practice/tax software and e-sign to push organized
      documents and request e-file authorization (e.g., Form 8879).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut intake effort per return by 60%+ and shorten cycle time by 7–10 days
    using an AI-driven organizer and dynamic checklist that auto-requests,
    classifies, and chases missing documents—securely and at scale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A tax-specific AI workflow engine trained on millions of tax pages and payer
    patterns that maps prior-year line items to expected documents and
    proactively chases gaps—combined with deep integrations into major
    tax/practice ecosystems and a compliance-first architecture built for GLBA
    and IRS 4557/1075 expectations. The resulting dataset of
    payer/entities-to-documents and reminder efficacy becomes a compounding
    moat.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
