leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Owners/ops managers spend 3–8 hours/week per location on ordering, counts,
      and invoice matching.
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts of key SKUs (flour, butter, yeast, chocolate) 1–3
      times/month, causing lost sales and rushed supplier runs.
    - >-
      COGS leakage from over‑ordering and spoilage (perishables) of 2–6% of
      ingredient spend.
    - >-
      Manual counts are error‑prone; on‑hand accuracy often <80%, leading to bad
      reorders and waste.
    - >-
      Invoices and POs often don’t match (unit conversions, price changes, short
      ships); 2–4% of lines have discrepancies that go unnoticed.
    - >-
      Multi‑unit bakeries lack visibility into store‑level usage vs. commissary
      output; transfers aren’t captured well.
    - >-
      Recipe/BOM changes (seasonal menus) are not reflected quickly in
      forecasts, causing misaligned par levels.
    - >-
      Vendors have variable lead times and pack sizes, making reorder timing and
      substitutions hard to manage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate POS sales and recipe/BOMs to auto‑decrement ingredient inventory
      in real time (by yield and loss factors).
    - >-
      Predictive par and reorder points per SKU using vendor lead times,
      seasonality, and planned production.
    - >-
      One‑click, vendor‑ready PO drafts with pack/size conversion and preferred
      substitutes.
    - >-
      Invoice capture (email/EDI/mobile scan) that auto‑reconciles to PO with
      price/quantity/pack variance flags.
    - >-
      Exception workflow for shorts/overages, credits, and returns; push clean
      bills to accounting.
    - >-
      Shelf‑life and waste signals (first‑expire, first‑out; bake‑to‑par
      suggestions) to reduce spoilage.
    - >-
      Multi‑store and commissary support with transfers and inter‑location
      allocation.
    - >-
      Analytics: stockout rate, on‑hand accuracy, COGS variance, supplier
      performance, and recipe margin impact.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never run out, never over‑order: bakery‑smart AI maintains rolling inventory
    from your recipes and sales, auto‑drafts POs that vendors can fill as‑is,
    and reconciles invoices to the penny—cutting stockouts and COGS waste by
    10–20% within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A bakery‑specific SKU/pack/UOM mapping and yield/loss factors library that
    improves accuracy out of the box; deep integrations with common bakery
    POS/recipe systems; growing dataset of vendor lead times and price trends
    enabling superior forecasts and auto‑reorder suggestions. Early partnerships
    with key distributors create switching costs and defensibility.

  character: >-
    Retail bakery owners and production managers who want reliable ingredient
    availability, lean inventory, and fewer 5am surprises.
  problem: >-
    - External: Disconnected POS, BOMs, and invoices create blind spots that
    cause stock‑outs, overbuying, and wasted prep.

    - Internal: The stress of guessing counts and firefighting rush orders
    instead of focusing on production and customers.

    - Philosophical: Bakers should craft great products—not manage spreadsheets
    and chase vendors.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand how vendor minimums, variable lead times, and
    early‑morning bakes amplify the cost of a single missed ingredient.

    - Authority: Built by food‑ops and data veterans; integrates with popular
    POS/accounting systems and supplier catalogs; designed specifically for
    retail bakeries.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect your POS sales, recipes/BOMs, vendor catalogs, and
    AP/invoice inbox.

    - Step 2: Our AI maintains a rolling ingredient inventory from sales and
    BOMs, flags lows, drafts POs, and reconciles invoices to POs and deliveries.

    - Step 3: You review/approve; we auto‑send POs, alert on variances and price
    drift, and keep an auditable trail.

    - Agreements: Clear approvals, transparent logs, flexible rollout—no
    long‑term contract.
