leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manually creating paper space layouts, viewports, and title blocks for
      30–200+ sheet sets consumes 4–16 hours per project, delaying submittals
      and tying up senior drafters.
    - >-
      Inconsistent client standards (layers, naming, scales, title block
      attributes) cause rework and RFIs; misaligned sheet indices and revision
      tracking increase errors and QA time.
    - >-
      Batch publishing (PDF/DWG) and transmittal packaging is fragmented across
      tools (SSM, eTransmit, Bluebeam, scripts), leading to missed xrefs, wrong
      plot settings, and incomplete deliverables.
    - >-
      Last-minute design changes force repetitive renaming/re-numbering and
      viewport re-scaling across many sheets; high risk of outdated details on
      final PDFs.
    - >-
      Multi-CAD environments (AutoCAD/Civil 3D/Revit/MicroStation) lack a
      unified workflow; teams rely on brittle LISP/Dynamo scripts that are hard
      to maintain.
    - >-
      Compliance requirements (ISO 19650 naming, NCS/AIA, DOT/USACE standards,
      client-specific layer/plot styles) are difficult to enforce consistently
      at scale.
    - >-
      Distributed/offshore drafting teams face version control and approval
      gaps; no audit trail for who published what, when, and with which
      standards.
    - >-
      Security constraints (air-gapped networks, strict owner-operator policies)
      limit cloud-only solutions; on-prem requirements are common in
      infrastructure/utilities/gov projects.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven layout engine analyzes model space/Revit views and auto-places
      scaled viewports with optimal arrangement, alignment, and legends per
      template rules.
    - >-
      Template- and rules-based title block population (attributes/parameters),
      sheet numbering, naming, and ISO 19650/NCS/AIA compliance validation.
    - >-
      Automated sheet index creation with discipline-based grouping, page
      sequencing, and revision history blocks; auto-updates on changes.
    - >-
      Batch publishing to PDF/DWG (and optional DWFx), including plot styles,
      layer states, and color tables; automated file naming, stamping, and
      bookmarks.
    - >-
      One-click transmittal packages: zipped PDFs/DWGs, xrefs, fonts/CTBs/STBs,
      readme, cover letter, and metadata (client, revision, project).
    - >-
      Change detection and re-publication: differences highlighted, updated
      sheets flagged; automatic comparison thumbnails for QC.
    - >-
      Integrations: Autodesk Platform Services (APS/Forge), AutoCAD/Revit
      plug-ins, ACC/BIM 360, Bluebeam, Procore, SharePoint, OneDrive; CLI + REST
      API.
    - >-
      On-prem publishing agent for secure networks (leveraging local CAD
      licenses), plus cloud service for flexible scaling.
    - >-
      Role-based approvals and e-sign-off before publish; full audit log with
      who/when/with-which-template; rollback and repro.
    - >-
      Usage analytics and ROI dashboard: time saved, error rate, rework avoided,
      publish success rates by project/team.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Push-button, standards-compliant sheet sets from model to transmittal:
    60–80% faster assembly, 30–50% fewer publishing errors, and a full audit
    trail. Cross-CAD (AutoCAD/Civil 3D/Revit), on-prem or cloud, with automatic
    title block population, sheet indices, revision management, and batch
    PDF/DWG publication.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-CAD AI layout engine and a growing, vetted standards/template library
    tied to measured publish outcomes, plus an on-prem agent for air-gapped
    networks. Early partnerships with Autodesk VARs and marquee pilot accounts
    create a data and distribution moat that DIY scripts and point tools cannot
    match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    CAD managers, BIM leads, and drafting teams who need consistent, on‑time
    plan sets and want to stop babysitting layouts and publishing.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual sheet setup (paper space layouts, viewports, title blocks,
    indices) and publishing (PDF/DWG + transmittals) is slow and error‑prone.
    Internal: Deadline pressure and QC anxiety before issue. Philosophical:
    Experts shouldn’t waste hours on tasks AI can do consistently and traceably.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the late‑night publish crunch and the pain of rework.
    Authority: Drafting‑focused AI tuned for DWG workflows, standards‑aware,
    human‑in‑the‑loop reviews, audit‑ready outputs and logs.
  plan: |-
    Process:
    1) Connect standards/templates and sample sheets
    2) Select model sources and target sheet set
    3) Set rules for naming, scales, title blocks, indices
    4) Review AI preview of layouts/viewports/title data
    5) Approve to build sheets and publish PDFs/DWGs with transmittals
    Agreement:
    - Secure, no lock‑in; works with your DWGs
    - Versioned outputs and rollback
    - QC report and change log provided

    data, traceable transmittals, fewer RFIs and rework, faster submittals,
    happier clients, and scalable capacity without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
