leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned elevator/escalator outages cause brand damage and SLA penalties;
      entrapments drive costly emergency callouts and regulatory scrutiny.
    - >-
      Technician scarcity and high turnover make it hard to interpret controller
      logs and trend data; tribal knowledge is not scalable.
    - >-
      Manual log reviews and route-based inspections miss early failure signals
      (doors, brakes, traction, handrail speed differential), leading to repeat
      visits and parts swaps.
    - >-
      Manufacturers face warranty costs from early-life failures and lack
      real-time fleet health visibility across models/regions.
    - >-
      Mixed fleets and legacy controllers create data silos; integrations to
      CMMS/BMS are brittle and time-consuming.
    - >-
      Service managers lack measurable, predictive KPIs to optimize inventory
      and dispatch; decisions are reactive rather than data-driven.
  solution:
    - >-
      Lightweight edge agent plugs into controller bus (CANopen Lift,
      RS-485/Modbus, proprietary serial) and optional sensors (current clamp,
      accelerometer, door operator encoder, escalator handrail speed sensor).
    - >-
      Cloud service ingests logs, error codes, event sequences, cycle counts,
      vibration/current signatures; runs anomaly detection, Remaining Useful
      Life (RUL) models, and rule-based safety checks.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts are generated with estimated lead time, confidence
      score, likely root cause, parts/bill-of-materials, and step-by-step
      checklist mapped to model and site.
    - >-
      Two-way CMMS integration (SAP PM, IBM Maximo, ServiceNow, UpKeep)
      auto-creates and updates work orders; mobile app supports photos,
      validation, and closes the label loop for model improvement.
    - >-
      Fleet dashboard benchmarks units by model/site/region, tracks SLA risk,
      and forecasts parts demand by SKU.
    - >-
      Security and compliance by design: read-only data path, role-based access,
      data residency options, IEC 62443-aligned hardening; no control commands
      issued.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce entrapments and downtime across your fleet with physics-informed AI
    that reads controller logs and sensor signals, predicts failures 3–21 days
    in advance, and auto-creates actionable work orders with parts lists—no
    control changes, safety-first, and deployable across mixed fleets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Firmware-level log decoding partnerships and an expanding, uniquely labeled
    failure dataset tied to technician-validated outcomes enable
    higher-precision, earlier predictions than generic PdM platforms.
    Physics-informed models and guided checklists close the loop from alert to
    fix, and a safety-first, read-only architecture eases regulatory and
    customer approval.
  customerSegments:
