  problem:
    - >-
      Control rooms lack accurate short-term visibility (2–72 hours) of linepack
      and nodal pressures, leading to conservative operations, fuel overuse, and
      avoidable OFOs/curtailments.
    - >-
      Constraint conditions (compressor limits, valve outages, temperature
      impacts, simultaneous nominations) are identified too late; advisories are
      reactive, not proactive.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: physics simulators, spreadsheets, and SCADA trend views
      don’t produce actionable, ranked setpoint/nominations guidance with
      quantified risk.
    - >-
      Financial leakage from imbalance penalties and excess compressor fuel
      burn; limited ability to validate ROI of operating decisions in real time.
    - >-
      Operational risk: inconsistent decision-making across shifts; lack of
      standardized, auditable advisories that align with procedures and
      regulatory expectations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML forecasts: transient hydraulic digital twin calibrated
      with ML state estimation and bias correction; updates every 5 minutes to 1
      hour.
    - >-
      Constraint detection and ranking: forecasted breaches of MAOP/MOP, station
      limits, suction/discharge bands, temperature-dependent constraints, and
      linepack minima/maxima with probability and lead time.
    - >-
      Advisory engine: generates feasible, ranked compressor setpoint and
      nomination adjustments; simulates outcomes; presents expected
      savings/risks and compliance checks.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: controllers/planners test nominations, outage scenarios,
      weather swings; instant KPIs and constraint impact deltas.
    - >-
      Closed-loop readiness: optional move from advisory-only to supervised
      auto-tuning of station setpoints under MOC and alarm/override policies.
    - >-
      Operational integration: read-only historian/SCADA ingestion,
      scheduling/nominations APIs (NAESB/EDI where applicable), weather feeds,
      compressor maps; on-prem or VPC deployment.
    - >-
      Explainability & audit: rationale, sensitivity, and traceability for each
      advisory; shift handover reports and post-event back-casts for continuous
      improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline gas control teams and schedulers at natural gas transmission
    operators who must deliver nominations safely, reliably, and efficiently.
  problem: >-
    Shifting nominations, variable supply and demand, and tight pressure limits
    create uncertainty; without short-term visibility, teams risk pressure
    violations, curtailments, imbalance penalties, lost throughput, and excess
    compressor fuel use.
  guide: >-
    Linepack Forecast and Constraint Advisor combines physics-based pipeline
    models with AI to forecast linepack, pressures, and constraints, delivering
    practical advisories for nominations and compressor setpoints. Built by
    pipeline optimization experts who understand gas control and SCADA/EMS
    workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect SCADA, nominations, compressor, and weather data. 2) Calibrate
    and validate short-term forecasts. 3) Deliver 6-72 hour forecasts and
    actionable advisories via dashboard and API, with alerts integrated into
    existing workflows.
  callToAction: Request a demo and start a 60-90 day pilot on your priority corridor.
  success: >-
    Early warning of constraints, higher delivery reliability, improved
    throughput, reduced compressor fuel and related emissions, and confident
    day-ahead and intraday decisions backed by clear, auditable recommendations.
  failure: >-
    Without it, operators fly blind into intraday swings, leading to pressure
    excursions, costly over-compression, imbalance charges, avoidable
    curtailments, and unhappy shippers.
