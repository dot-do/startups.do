  problem:
    - >-
      Angel’s share (evaporation) and proof drift are highly variable by
      warehouse, floor, row, season, and barrel attributes, making yield and
      readiness forecasts unreliable.
    - >-
      Rotation and warehouse placement decisions are driven by rules of thumb,
      not quantified ROI, causing unnecessary loss, flavor inconsistency, and
      labor inefficiency.
    - >-
      Distilleries lack a unified view of barrel-level weight/proof history,
      environmental data, and sensory notes; data is siloed across ERP,
      spreadsheets, and sensor vendors.
    - >-
      Inventory and production planning (bottling windows, SKU readiness,
      finishing programs) suffer from forecast error, tying up working capital
      and risking out-of-stock or over-aged barrels.
    - >-
      Compliance and risk exposures (TTB recordkeeping, leakage, warehouse
      structural risk, hot spots) are reactive rather than predicted, leading to
      write-offs and insurance issues.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI models forecast per-barrel weight loss, proof trajectory, and a
      Maturation Readiness Index (MRI) to identify optimal bottling windows
      (e.g., 6–24 months ahead).
    - >-
      Digital twin of warehouses (floor/row/position) that models microclimates
      and simulates the effect of moving barrels (what-if scenarios for
      placement, rotation cadence, venting, humidification).
    - >-
      Task engine that generates weekly prioritized movement/rotation plans with
      predicted yield impact and labor-hour estimates.
    - >-
      Anomaly and leak detection from weight/proof trends and environmental
      data; early alerts with risk scores.
    - >-
      Blend and finishing planning support (e.g., identify candidates for
      finishing by cask profile and projected trajectory).
    - >-
      Data connectors to ERP/Distillery systems (e.g., Whiskey Systems, Ekos,
      Orchestrated/Aptean, NetSuite), lab/proofing systems, weighbridges/scales,
      and IoT sensors (Vaisala/Monnit/Ellab).
    - >-
      Compliance-ready barrel history with immutable audit trails; export to
      TTB-required reports.
    - >-
      Executive dashboard quantifying yield saved (LAA), cycle-time reduction,
      consistency metrics, and financial impact.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Head distillers, warehouse managers, and ops leaders at whiskey/rum/brandy
    distilleries who want predictable maturation, higher yield, and confident
    bottling decisions.
  problem: >-
    Angel’s share variability, warehouse microclimates, and proof drift make
    outcomes unpredictable; teams rely on gut feel, risk missed release windows,
    inconsistent flavor, and lost revenue.
  guide: >-
    We understand craftsmanship and the cost of evaporation. Our
    distillery-trained AI analyzes historical fills, warehouse conditions, and
    sensor logs to forecast loss, maturation, and readiness with proven
    accuracy—trusted by producers and transparent in method.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect barrel inventory, fill/proof data, and warehouse maps—or use our
    importer. 2) Receive forecasts for weight/proof loss, maturation trajectory,
    and bottling readiness plus rotation and rack/warehouse placement
    recommendations. 3) Act with alerts, monitor outcomes, and iterate via
    monthly optimization reviews. Start with a 90-day pilot under a clear
    data-privacy agreement.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and launch a 90-day pilot. Transitional: Download the
    maturation ROI calculator and sample forecast report.
  success: >-
    Maximize yield and ABV compliance, hit flavor targets on time, lock
    predictable release calendars, optimize warehouse capacity and rotations,
    reduce angel’s share losses, and improve cash flow with data-backed
    decisions.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing; lose proof and gallons to avoidable evaporation; tie up
    capital in over- or under-matured barrels; miss release dates; blend to
    cover inconsistency; waste warehouse space and labor.

    - 'Sales, inventory, and compliance plans hinge on uncertain readiness.'
  solution:
    - 'Barrel-level forecasts for weight, proof, ABV, and volume by date.'
    - Maturation progression scoring to target desired flavor development.
    - Bottling readiness predictions aligned to your specs and windows.
    - 'Rotation and placement recommendations by warehouse, rick, and tier.'

    - ERP/BI connectors and CSV/API export for planning and reporting.
    - Web dashboard and mobile-friendly views for floor teams and managers.
    - 'Role-based access, audit trail, and data retention controls.'
  steps:
    - Connect inventory and sampling data; map warehouses and layouts.
    - >-
      Set targets: proof range, maturation profile, bottling windows,
      constraints.
    - 'Run baseline forecast to see yield, proof drift, and readiness timelines.'
    - Review optimizer’s placement/rotation plan and accept or adjust.
    - Generate work orders; monitor alerts as conditions and samples update.
