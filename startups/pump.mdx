  problem:
    - >-
      Pipeline operators must meet nominated throughput while staying below
      MAOP, suction limits, and surge constraints; current operations rely on
      fixed pump schedules and conservative DRA rules, driving excessive energy
      and chemical spend.
    - >-
      Energy is the second-largest controllable OPEX item for pipelines;
      electricity usage is often 20–60 MW per trunkline with limited real-time
      optimization across stations.
    - >-
      DRA is frequently overdosed due to uncertainty in batch properties and
      shear degradation; dosing is set at static ppm targets rather than
      cost-optimal, throughput-compliant levels.
    - >-
      Control rooms lack a unified tool that co-optimizes pump setpoints,
      station configurations, and DRA dosing against real-time hydraulics, batch
      interfaces, and ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Existing hydraulic simulators are not designed for continuous, closed-loop
      advisory with M&V and do not capture changing product slates,
      elevation/temperature effects, and DRA performance in near real-time.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance constraints (MAOP, NPSH margin, slack-line
      avoidance, surge risk) make manual optimization risky, pushing operators
      to conservative settings with hidden costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy a physics-informed, real-time optimization engine that co-optimizes
      pump schedules, VFD speeds, series/parallel configurations, and DRA ppm to
      minimize $/bbl under hard constraints (MAOP, suction pressure/NPSH, surge,
      slack-line, temperature).
    - >-
      Continuously ingest SCADA/historian data (e.g., OSIsoft PI) for pressures,
      flows, power, temperatures; batch tracker data for API/viscosity; and DRA
      injection/stock. Autocalibrate a digital twin per segment to maintain
      model fidelity (<2% flow and <3% pressure error on rolling 7-day windows).
    - >-
      Advisory outputs every 1–5 minutes: station-level setpoints (rpm,
      start/stop), valve positions, recommended DRA ppm by injection site,
      expected cost/bbl and constraint margins; includes explanations and
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Scenario and day-ahead planning: evaluate nominations, ambient forecasts,
      and tankage plans to produce next-day schedules with expected costs,
      sensitivity to product mix, and risk flags.
    - >-
      Built-in M&V: compare against baseline control periods normalized for
      ambient and batch properties; provide finance-grade savings reports (kWh
      and $ per 1,000 bbl-km; DRA ppm per 1,000 bbl).
    - >-
      Integration and change management: read-only advisory phase (60–90 days)
      with controller acceptance tracking, then optional closed-loop setpoint
      write-back through approved APC/SCADA interlocks; full audit trail and
      rollback.
    - >-
      Safety-by-design: hard guardrails on pressures/flows, surge-check
      transient screening on candidate setpoints, and automated lockouts if
      sensor quality degrades or model uncertainty grows beyond thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Meet nominated throughput at the lowest combined energy and DRA cost—safely
    and compliantly—via real-time, physics-informed AI advisory integrated with
    SCADA. Typical savings: 5–12% electrical energy and 10–30% DRA usage
    reduction with zero constraint violations, verified by built-in M&V.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A unified, safety-first optimizer that co-optimizes energy and DRA using
    validated, physics-informed models with real-time uncertainty control,
    coupled with finance-grade M&V and deep integrations to SCADA/EPMS and DRA
    skids. Access to proprietary dosing-response datasets via chemical supplier
    partnerships and proven case studies establishes switching costs and
    credibility competitors lack.

  problem: >-
    - Villain: Escalating power prices and chemical waste hidden in complex
    hydraulics.

    - External: Dynamic batches, viscosity swings, pump curves, MAOP and power
    caps, station constraints—making manual setpoint and DRA decisions
    suboptimal.

    - Internal: Teams are forced to guess and firefight, never confident they’re
    running at minimum cost.

    marginal cost, with transparent reasoning.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure of keeping linefill moving while
    staying inside pressure, power, and nomination limits—shift after shift.

    Define constraints/objectives 3) Calibrate digital twin 4) Optimize pump
    schedules, setpoints, DRA dosing 5) Deliver advisories via HMI/API and track
    outcomes.

    enforced, auditable recommendations, no-autonomy default, clear KPI
    baselines and change management.
