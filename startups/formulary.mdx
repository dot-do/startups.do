  problem:
    - >-
      High patient copays and non-formulary rejections lead to abandoned
      prescriptions (often 15–30% abandonment for >$100 copays), lost pharmacy
      revenue, and poor adherence.
    - >-
      Pharmacy staff spend 3–10 minutes per problem claim researching
      plan-preferred alternatives, manufacturer copay cards, or patient
      assistance programs (PAPs), hurting workflow and wait times.
    - >-
      Existing tools are fragmented (PBM portals, manufacturer hubs, discount
      sites, ePA portals) and not embedded in the pharmacy workflow, resulting
      in low utilization.
    - >-
      Pharmacies face compliance risks when assisting with savings (e.g.,
      federal program exclusions, anti-kickback rules, data privacy) and need
      audit trails and policy guardrails.
    - >-
      Manufacturers and PAPs change program rules frequently; pharmacies lack
      up-to-date, actionable guidance at the point of sale.
    - >-
      Specialty and high-cost brand therapies require complex benefit triage and
      enrollment steps that are manual and error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Point-of-sale agent monitors claim adjudication messages in real time to
      flag high patient-pay, non-formulary, step-therapy, prior auth, or
      DAW-driven cost issues.
    - >-
      AI-driven alternative engine suggests plan-preferred equivalents and
      therapeutically appropriate lower-cost options mapped by GPI/NDC, Orange
      Book equivalence, and plan-specific formulary tiers.
    - >-
      Automated enrollment into eligible commercial copay programs, manufacturer
      hubs, and PAPs; generates or retrieves copay cards; pre-fills forms; and
      triggers required consents with e-sign/text.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails enforce exclusions for federal health care programs
      and state-specific rules; maintains audit trails and consent artifacts.
    - >-
      Workflow-native: one-click from the pharmacy dispensing/POS screen;
      printable/textable savings info for patients; task routing to techs vs.
      pharmacists.
    - >-
      Analytics and ROI dashboard: tracks abandonment reduction, time saved per
      claim, acceptance rates, and revenue impact; benchmarking across stores.
    - >-
      Optional ePA assist: pre-populates ePA with formulary alternatives and
      clinical rationale; nudges prescribers with templated change requests via
      fax/Direct messaging where permitted.
    - >-
      Security and privacy: HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, BAAs, role-based
      access, immutable logs, and data minimization with pharmacy system
      integrations via secure APIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automatically detects high copays and non-formulary claims at the point of
    sale, proposes clinically and plan-preferred alternatives, and completes
    eligible savings/enrollment steps—reducing abandonment, saving staff time,
    and improving adherence with full compliance and auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Embedded, real-time POS integration that unifies formulary alternatives,
    copay/PAP enrollment, and ePA into a single click with compliance guardrails
