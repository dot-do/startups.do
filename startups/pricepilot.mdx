leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Pricing is manual, infrequent, and anchored to broad guidebooks (J.D.
      Power/NADA, Black Book) rather than live local comps—leading to missed
      gross on fast movers and aged inventory that ties up floorplan.
    - >-
      Dealers lack continuous visibility into local competitor price moves and
      listings; monitoring is ad hoc (RVTrader/RVT searches) and time-consuming.
    - >-
      Days-on-market (DoM) is long for many used RV segments (often 90–150
      days), with floorplan interest and depreciation eroding gross by
      $10–$30/day/unit.
    - >-
      Seasonality, regional demand shifts, and event-driven spikes (holiday
      weekends, weather) are not systematically incorporated into pricing
      decisions.
    - >-
      Price changes don’t reliably propagate across DMS and marketplaces,
      causing stale prices and inconsistent shopper experience.
    - >-
      Managers can’t easily quantify pricing ROI (gross lift, DoM reduction,
      aging mix) or enforce pricing strategy (e.g., target gross, aging ladders)
      across teams/rooftops.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate compliant local comp data
      (year/make/model/trim/floorplan/mileage/condition, price history, DoM)
      from marketplaces and partners; normalize to RV-specific attributes.
    - >-
      Model local demand and seasonality per class (Class A/B/C, Fifth Wheel,
      Travel Trailer, Toy Hauler), factoring regional trends, holidays, weather,
      and campground activity proxies.
    - >-
      Compute nightly price recommendations per VIN: balance target gross,
      likelihood-to-sell, and aging strategy (discount ladders) with confidence
      intervals.
    - >-
      Auto-sync accepted price updates to DMS and listings (RV Trader, RVT,
      website) with audit trails; optional auto-approve rules for low-risk
      changes.
    - >-
      Competitor comp monitor: track defined local comp sets; alert on price
      drops, new arrivals, and undercut opportunities vs your price-to-market%.
    - >-
      A/B testing of pricing rulesets; attribution to sold outcomes; dashboards
      on gross lift, DoM reduction, and aging mix improvement.
    - >-
      Mobile workflows for approvals, exception handling, and store-level
      guardrails (min gross, min/maximum discount bounds).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Nightly, VIN-level price recommendations that maximize front-end gross while
    hitting target turn, using real-time local comps, days-on-market,
    seasonality, and your target gross—plus automated push to DMS and listing
    sites, and competitor move alerts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop outcomes data and integrations across multiple DMS/marketplaces
    create a proprietary dataset that improves local elasticity and seasonality
    modeling over time; dealership network effects sharpen comp relevance.
    RV-specific attribute normalization and floorplan-cost-aware strategies are
    embedded into the models and workflows, making it hard for horizontal
    repricers to match performance or dealer usability.
  customerSegments:
    - Independent single-rooftop RV dealers (50–300 units in stock).
