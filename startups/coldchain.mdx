  problem:
    - >-
      Temperature excursions in poultry supply chains are detected late or
      inconsistently, leading to product loss, safety risk, and preventable
      shrink.
    - >-
      Claims are often denied due to incomplete or non-compliant documentation
      (missing calibrated logger data, chain-of-custody, time–temp analysis,
      photos, BOL/POD), reducing recovery rates.
    - >-
      Manual review of trip logs is time-consuming (30–90 minutes per shipment)
      and error-prone, delaying claim submission beyond carrier/supplier SLA
      windows (24–72 hours).
    - >-
      QA, logistics, and claims teams rely on disparate systems (logger portals,
      TMS/WMS, email) with no unified workflow or audit trail, increasing
      administrative cost and legal exposure (FSMA, HACCP).
    - >-
      Lack of poultry-specific shelf-life impact modeling results in over- or
      under-claiming, damaging supplier/carrier relationships and profitability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of trip temperature logs (PDF, CSV, native) from major
      logger/telematics providers with calibration verification and tamper
      detection.
    - >-
      AI-driven excursion detection with poultry-specific thresholds (fresh:
      32–39°F/0–4°C; frozen: ≤-18°C/0°F) and time–temperature integration to
      quantify shelf-life loss and economic impact.
    - >-
      One-click claim pack generation: claim letter, time–temp graphs, GPS
      trace, BOL/POD, photos, carrier contract/SLA references, product specs,
      calibration certificates, and root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Workflow and SLA management: assign owners, track deadlines (e.g., submit
      within 48 hours of delivery), versioned audit trail, and secure external
      sharing links for carriers/suppliers/insurers.
    - >-
      Predictive alerts during transit (optional real-time) to enable corrective
      action and reduce claim frequency.
    - >-
      Analytics: excursion rate by lane/carrier/product, claim
      acceptance/recovery trends, heatmaps, and supplier/carrier scorecards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From logger to paid claim in under 2 hours. Automated, compliance-grade
    temperature excursion detection and claim pack generation tailored to
    poultry, improving recovery by 20–40%, cutting review time by 70%+, and
    reducing shrink with defensible, data-driven documentation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking poultry temperature profiles to claim
    outcomes and shelf-life loss—allowing highly accurate, defensible decisions;
    pre-built, partner-approved claim templates that speed acceptance; and deep
    integrations across leading logger and TMS ecosystems that reduce
    time-to-value and switching friction.
