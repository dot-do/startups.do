  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned die failures in copper extrusion and wire drawing cause
      unplanned downtime (1–3 hours/incident) and expensive scrap, with little
      early warning.
    - >-
      Die life is highly sensitive to speed, billet temperature, lubrication,
      and bearing alignment; operators lack real-time, data-driven setpoint
      guidance to minimize wear while hitting throughput targets.
    - >-
      Surface defects (chatter, scoring, die lines) are often detected late,
      causing rework/scrap and masking upstream root causes.
    - >-
      Maintenance schedules are calendar/throughput-based rather than
      condition-based, leading to both premature die changes and overrun to
      failure.
    - >-
      Data exists (press logs, SCADA, quality data, die refurbishment reports)
      but is siloed and not harmonized to learn die wear patterns across alloys,
      geometries, and presses.
    - >-
      Existing vision systems detect defects but do not estimate remaining
      useful life (RUL) of dies or translate insights into actionable setpoint
      recommendations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-deployed computer vision models monitor extrudate/wire surface and
      die face to detect wear signatures and defects; fused with machine/quality
      logs to estimate die RUL with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Closed-loop advisory engine recommends actionable setpoint changes (e.g.,
      reduce speed by 5–8%, increase billet temp by 10–15°C, adjust bearing gap
      by 0.02–0.05 mm) to slow wear and improve surface finish.
    - >-
      Physics-informed + data-driven models incorporate alloy, geometry,
      lubricant regime, and die material to generalize across presses/lines with
      minimal cold-start data.
    - >-
      Die Passport: digital history per die (geometry, steel, refurb cycles,
      loads, temps, past performance) to personalize RUL estimates and optimize
      refurbishment timing.
    - >-
      Operator-facing HMI and mobile app: real-time alerts with reason codes;
      one-click accept/override; A/B run support for safe experimentation.
    - >-
      Integration with SCADA/MES (OPC UA, Modbus/TCP, MQTT) and quality systems
      to align recommendations with production orders and alloy schedules.
    - >-
      Root-cause analytics: correlates defects to upstream conditions (heater
      zones, bearing wear, lube flow) and quantifies impact on die wear per
      parameter.
    - >-
      Cybersecure, low-latency edge inference (50–200 ms) with on-prem or hybrid
      cloud MLOps; fail-safe design that never forces control without operator
      approval (or optional supervised closed-loop).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict die remaining useful life and optimize press/drawing parameters
    (speed, billet temperature, lubrication, bearing alignment) in real time to
    extend die life 20–40%, reduce defect scrap 20–30%, and cut unplanned
    die-related downtime 30–50% — without sacrificing throughput.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing corpus of labeled die wear and surface defect data tied to process
    and die refurbishment outcomes across multiple plants and alloys, combined
    with physics-informed models that enable accurate RUL and safe,
    high-acceptance recommendations from day one. Digital Die Passports create
    lock-in and continuous improvement that general-purpose vision or analytics
    tools cannot match.

    Plant managers, process engineers, and maintenance leads in copper rolling,
    drawing, extruding, and alloying (NAICS 331420) who need to hit throughput
    and surface-finish targets while controlling die costs.
  problem: >-
    External: unpredictable die wear causes chatter/scratches, scrap, and
    unplanned changeovers; Internal: teams are forced to run blind and reactive
    under delivery pressure; Philosophical: you shouldn’t have to sacrifice die
    life to meet production targets.
  guide: >-
    We understand copper line realities—heat, load, lubrication, and bearing
    interplay—and we’ve built AI that sees wear before it bites. Proven computer
    vision + log analytics with pilots showing +30–50% die life, −15–25% scrap,
    and fewer stops; references available.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: connect cameras and ingest PLC/SCADA logs; 2) Calibrate: 2–4
    weeks model learning and threshold tuning; 3) Go live: real-time
    remaining-life predictions and speed/temperature/bearing recommendations in
    HMI with alerts and maintenance scheduling. Start on one line, fixed-price
    pilot, secure on‑prem or VPC.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute line assessment and book a 60‑day pilot.

    operations team.
  failure: >-
    Burning dies early, chasing surface defects, costly scrap and downtime,
