leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier COAs arrive in mixed formats (PDF scans, spreadsheets, emails)
      causing slow, error-prone manual data entry and delays in lot acceptance
      decisions (often 4–24 hours per truck/train).
    - >-
      Suboptimal binning and blending decisions increase raw barley cost per
      tonne and risk of out-of-spec malt batches; decisions are often rule-based
      rather than optimized across constraints (capacity, specs, risk,
      schedules).
    - >-
      Quality and risk are difficult to quantify at decision time; variability
      in DON, protein, moisture, and germination leads to unanticipated failures
      or conservative over-spend on high-grade barley.
    - >-
      Traceability and auditability are fragmented across ERP/LIMS/Excel, making
      it hard to prove compliance, perform vendor scorecards, or run what-if
      analyses.
    - >-
      Limited ability to simulate plant-specific yield impacts (e.g., steep
      losses, extract, color) from barley attributes leads to missed
      opportunities to accept borderline lots for cost savings without quality
      compromise.
    - >-
      Inventory and bin utilization are suboptimal (e.g., variety segregation,
      mixed crop years), causing silo bottlenecks and higher working capital.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated COA ingestion and normalization from PDFs, images, XLS, email,
      and EDI with confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop QA.
    - >-
      Plant-specific optimization engine (MILP/stochastic) that assigns lots to
      bins and proposes finished-malt blends to meet multi-customer spec
      portfolios at minimum cost and risk.
    - >-
      Risk-aware constraints and objective functions (e.g., DON tail risk,
      protein variance, moisture limits, variety segregation, silo capacity,
      cleaning/transition losses, minimum run sizes).
    - >-
      Process-aware yield modeling that translates COA inputs to plant outcomes
      (extract, color, beta-glucan, steep loss) using historical data and
      ASBC/EBC methods.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if tools (e.g., tighter customer specs,
      weather-driven DON spikes, price changes) with side-by-side cost/risk
      comparisons.
    - >-
      Vendor scorecards and acceptance thresholds that adapt to supplier
      performance; negotiated pricing decision support.
    - >-
      Full audit trail and traceability: COA source to bin to malt lot to
      customer shipment; change logs for QA/compliance.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to ERP/MES/LIMS (SAP, Infor M3, Dynamics, Odoo), lab
      portals, and data lakes.
    - >-
      Alerts and workflows: exceptions, low-confidence parses, spec excursions,
      silo nearing constraints, contract utilization.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn unstructured barley COAs into optimized, auditable lot acceptance,
    binning, and blending plans that hit malt specs at the lowest total cost and
    risk—reducing raw material spend 1–3%, cutting decision time by 80–90%, and
    lowering out-of-spec incidents by 30–60%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary cross-supplier dataset linking COAs to true plant outcomes and
    customer specs, enabling more accurate risk and yield models than generic

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, quality, and procurement leaders at malt plants who must accept
    barley lots and build blends that meet customer specs at the lowest cost and
    risk.
  problem: >-
    External: Variable barley lots and COAs (protein, moisture, germ, DON,
    plumpness) arrive in many formats; manual binning/blending to hit malt
    targets (extract, DP, FAN, color, beta-glucan) is slow and error-prone.
    Internal: Teams overblend to be safe, lose yield and margin, and lack
    confidence. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to gamble specs and brand
    trust because data is messy.
  guide: >-
    Barley Lot Acceptance and Blending Optimizer is your AI guide. We understand
    malt operations and spec pressure, and bring proven optimization models,
    high-accuracy COA parsing, and malt-domain expertise. Secure, compliant, and
    integrates with LIMS/ERP to fit your workflow.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect COAs and lab/ERP data (email/PDF/XLS/API). 2) Configure specs,
    bins/SKUs, costs, and risk limits. 3) Review AI accept/reject flags and
    optimal binning/blends; approve and export to operations. Ongoing: scenario
    simulations, alerts, and audit-ready reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 4-week pilot on your last 3–6
    months of COAs. Transitional: Get a free variability, cost, and risk
    baseline report.
  success: >-
    Consistent spec hits; lower cost per tonne; faster lot acceptance; fewer
    rejections and downgrades; higher yield and throughput; better inventory
    utilization and supplier grading; auditable, traceable decisions.
  failure: >-
    Without it: spec misses and rework; excessive safety blending and higher
    costs; manual errors; production delays; inventory write-offs; supplier
    disputes and avoidable margin loss.
