leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable bed-level CPUE leads to 10–25% of trip time spent
      searching/experimenting with tows, lowering margins and increasing fuel
      burn.
    - >-
      Over-harvesting high-yield beds causes stress and future depletion,
      driving seasonal closures and quota cuts.
    - >-
      Skipper knowledge is siloed; co-ops and fleets struggle to coordinate
      weekly bed rotation that balances yield, bycatch, and sustainability.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity (rotating closures, size limits, protected habitats)
      makes planning risky; accidental non-compliance triggers fines/grounds
      closures.
    - >-
      Data exists (e-logbooks, VMS/AIS, surveys, ocean data) but is fragmented;
      few tools convert it into bed-level, week-ahead tactical guidance.
    - >-
      Fuel is 20–40% of trip cost in many fleets; unnecessary tows/long transits
      inflate cost per kg landed.
  solution:
    - >-
      Spatiotemporal CPUE forecasts per bed (1–4 week horizon) with 50/80%
      confidence bands, updated daily from logs, AIS/VMS, ocean/biophysical
      data.
    - >-
      Weekly rotation planner that allocates effort across beds to maximize
      expected kg/hour subject to rules (closures, minimum sizes), co-op
      policies, and bed-stress caps.
    - >-
      On-vessel and shoreside apps (offline-capable) showing ranked bed
      recommendations, tow start windows, and fuel/time trade-offs.
    - >-
      Co-op coordination mode: de-conflicts fleets to avoid crowding, sets
      bed-level effort caps, and shares aggregate (not individual) intel to
      maintain trust.
    - >-
      Compliance overlays: dynamic closures, habitat layers, bycatch risk
      forecasts; alerts if planned tow risks non-compliance.
    - >-
      Learning loop: post-trip easy feedback (actual CPUE, size distribution)
      retrains models; per-vessel calibration for gear and skipper effects.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase CPUE 8–15% and cut fuel per kg 10–20% by forecasting bed-level
    productivity 1–4 weeks ahead and auto-generating a compliant weekly rotation
    plan that spreads effort, protects stressed beds, and boosts sustainable
    yield.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    First mover with co-op-level coordination plus compliance-aware rotation
    optimization, powered by a growing proprietary dataset of bed-level labeled
    tows and stress indices; trusted pilot results and embedded onboard
    workflows create switching costs and a data network effect.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Wild shellfish fleets and co-ops (scallops, clams/quahogs,
      oysters, cockles) in US/Canada, UK/EU, NZ/AU.
    - >-
      Secondary: Shellfish aquaculture farms managing lease beds that require
      rotational harvest planning.
    - >-
      Tertiary: Processors/marketers contracting fleets and seeking stable
      landings; fishery managers and co-management bodies interested in bed
      health indicators.

    - >-
      Partnerships with e-logbook vendors and marine electronics dealers to
      bundle BedWise within existing onboard workflows.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Shellfish fishery managers, fleet owners, and coop leaders who want
    predictable, sustainable harvests by bed
  problem: >-
    External CPUE swings, bed over-stress, and mistimed openings cause wasted
    trips and closures. Internal planning feels like guesswork. Philosophical
    sustainability should not require roulette
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit targets without harming stocks and provide
    an AI that forecasts CPUE by bed and recommends weekly rotations to maximize
    yield and reduce bed stress, trained on seasons of CPUE, tides, temperature,
    and effort data
  plan: >-
    Step 1 Connect logbooks, VMS, and environmental feeds. Step 2 Receive weekly
    CPUE forecasts by bed with a rotation plan. Step 3 Fish the plan, log
    results, and let the model adapt
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot. Upload the last two seasons. Receive your first
    rotation plan by Friday and align crews to the recommended beds
  success: >-
    Higher CPUE per hour, steadier landings, fewer closures, lower fuel and
    labor waste, verified sustainability, and better margins
  failure: >-
    Without it you face boom-bust trips, stressed beds, emergency closures,
    compliance risk, and lost revenue and reputation
