  problem:
    - >-
      Price mismatches between shelf tags and POS pricebook create compliance
      risk (state weights and measures fines $100–$1,000 per incident) and erode
      margin through undercharges.
    - >-
      Out-of-stocks on fast-moving SKUs (beverages, tobacco, salty snacks,
      energy drinks) drive lost sales; typical on-shelf availability gaps in
      c-stores run 6–12% during peak hours.
    - >-
      Planogram non-compliance (especially tobacco wall, beverage coolers, and
      promotional endcaps) leads to lost vendor rebates, poor customer
      experience, and missed upsell opportunities.
    - >-
      Managers lack time and tools to manually audit shelves; current audits are
      infrequent, subjective, and take 30–60 minutes per aisle.
    - >-
      Existing solutions are either too expensive (robots, ESLs) or generic
      (manual audit apps) and don’t integrate with c-store pricebook/back-office
      systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile app to capture shelf/cooler/tobacco photos with guided prompts and
      automatic stitching for bays and doors.
    - >-
      Computer vision and OCR to detect SKUs, facings, facings count, tag
      prices, promo labels, and empty slots; specialized models for cooler doors
      and tobacco walls.
    - >-
      Real-time cross-check with store pricebook (PDI/NCR) to flag tag-to-POS
      mismatches and missing/expired promos.
    - >-
      Planogram ingestion (Blue Yonder/JDA, PDF images from distributors) to
      assess compliance by bay/door and produce exception lists.
    - >-
      Out-of-stock detection with severity ranking and automated reorder
      suggestions matched to preferred distributor SKUs.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: assign issues to staff, set SLAs, verify with
      follow-up photos; store- and chain-level dashboards.
    - >-
      Scorecards for compliance and vendor rebates; exportable evidence packs
      for audits and chargeback disputes.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations to back-office (PDI Enterprise, NCR RPOS),
      distributor ordering (EDI), and task management tools (Zipline, Reflexis).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Photo-driven shelf audits built for fuel c-stores: in 5 minutes, managers
    capture aisles and get precise, actionable flags for price mismatches,
    out-of-stocks, and planogram issues—integrated with the store’s pricebook
    and distributor planograms—delivering 1–3% sales uplift and measurable
    compliance gains without new hardware.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific CV/OCR models and labeled datasets for high-variance c-store
    environments (coolers, tobacco), plus embedded integrations with PDI/NCR and
    distributor planograms that competitors lack—creating data network effects
    and switching costs as accuracy improves per store and category.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Multi-store operators (MSOs) with 10–1,000+ fuel c-stores seeking
      consistent execution across locations.

      low-cost way to maintain price accuracy and availability.

      Category captains/CPGs (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Red Bull, Frito-Lay, Altria)
      co-funding execution audits tied to rebates and resets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Gas station convenience store managers who need shelves and coolers to match
    price files and planograms without walking every aisle.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Constant price changes, vendor resets, and manual spot checks.

    - External: Price mismatches, out-of-stocks, wrong facings and facings
    counts, missing labels.

    - Internal: Frustration and lost confidence due to low visibility across
    shifts and stores.

    shouldn’t consume scarce labor.
  guide: >-
    We understand c-store operations where small teams juggle forecourt,
    register, vendors, and resets. Our AI is purpose-built for c-stores, trained
    on shelf and cooler photos, and integrates with POS/back-office price files
    and planograms. Used by operators like you, with fast turnaround and
    measurable accuracy.
  plan: >-
    - 1. Snap and upload aisle and cooler photos from any phone.

    - 2. AI compares images to price files and planograms; flags price
    mismatches, out-of-stocks, misplacements, and priorities.

    - 3. Fix issues and mark complete; dashboards and exception reports update
    automatically for store and HQ.

    - Agreement: No hardware or downtime, simple district rollout, secure data
    handling, pilot-friendly terms.
