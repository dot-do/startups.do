  title: Dynamic Dock/Appointment Rescheduler
  description: >-
    Monitors ETAs and traffic; books or reschedules dock appointments
    automatically to reduce detention for local runs.
  targetUsers:
    - Dispatchers
    - Customer service reps
    - Local fleet managers
  triggers:
    - New load with appointment needed

    - Customer dock delay posted
  inputs:
    - Load details and preferred windows
    - Live GPS/ETA
    - Receiver portal credentials or email contacts
    - Detention rules
  steps:
    - Watch ETAs vs appointments; predict lateness
    - Query receiver portals for slots; propose best-fit time
    - Auto-reschedule or draft email/call script
    - Confirm changes with shipper/receiver; update TMS and driver
    - Log actions for audit and accessorials

    - OpenDock/PortTMS/Appointment APIs (where available)
    - Traffic/ETA (Google/Mapbox)
    - Email (Gmail/Outlook API) and templated RPA
    - Twilio voice/SMS (if phone scheduling)
    - TMS API
  outputs:
    - Confirmed appointment times
    - Customer/driver notifications
    - Detention reduction report
  pricingModel:

  risks:
    - Receiver portals may lack APIs (need email/phone RPA)

  problem:
    - >-
      Local specialized freight carriers lose 45–120 minutes per stop due to
      late/early arrivals and rigid dock schedules, driving detention costs
      ($50–$100/hour) and missed turns.
    - >-
      Dispatchers waste 1–3 hours/day/dispatcher on portal logins, emails, and
      phone tag to make or change appointments.
    - >-
      ETA predictions in TMS/ELD are not dock-aware (don’t account for site
      congestion, check-in process, HOS, live/unload duration), causing
      avoidable misses.
    - >-
      Shippers/DCs suffer from uneven dock utilization and unplanned peaks,
      increasing labor overtime and yard congestion.
    - >-
      Existing appointment systems are static and not integrated with real-time
      traffic and fleet ETAs; rescheduling is mostly manual and after the fact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous ETA engine combines ELD/GPS, traffic, weather, HOS, and
      historical dock wait times to predict arrival to the gate and to the door.
    - >-
      Autonomous appointment agent books/reschedules across portals, APIs,
      email, and voice calls with documented audit trails.
    - >-
      Multi-stop re-optimizer reorders stops within constraints (HOS, time
      windows, service priorities) and submits new appointment proposals
      automatically.
    - >-
      Exception workflows escalate to human-in-the-loop concierge for
      hard-to-reach facilities and special requirements (hazmat, escorts,
      lumpers).
    - >-
      Dock analytics surface site-specific best times and required lead times to
      minimize wait; feedback loop improves predictions and success rates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce detention and missed appointments for local specialized runs by
    autonomously booking and rescheduling dock slots using real-time ELD/GPS
    ETAs, traffic, and dock behavior data—delivering 30–40% fewer detention
    minutes, +10–15% on-time performance, and +0.1–0.3 extra turns per truck per
    day.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    DockFlex AI combines dock-aware ETAs from direct ELD data with a growing
    library of facility-specific playbooks and an autonomous multi-channel
    rescheduler (API, portal automation, email, and voice). The accumulating
    feedback loop—appointment outcomes, wait times, and best-contact protocols
    per site—creates a data moat and higher automation rates over time that
    generic TMS modules and pure ETA vendors lack.

  character: >-
    Operations managers and dispatchers at local specialized-freight carriers
    who need to keep trucks moving and hit tight dock windows.
  problem: >-
    External: Traffic shifts and changing ETAs lead to missed or suboptimal dock
    appointments and costly detention. Internal: Dispatchers are stuck juggling
    calls and portals—feeling blind, reactive, and stressed. Philosophical:
    Minutes lost at the dock shouldn’t cost drivers and shippers money.

    We understand the chaos of local runs where a 15-minute slip can snowball.
    Our AI monitors live traffic, ETAs, and facility calendars, integrating with
    your TMS/ELD and dock portals so appointments flex with reality, not
    paperwork.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Link TMS/ELD/telematics and facility accounts, set rules and
    windows. 2) Monitor + decide: AI predicts ETA changes and selects the best
    available slots within your constraints. 3) Act + confirm:
    Auto-book/reschedule, notify drivers and facilities, and log every change.
    Assurances: You set approvals, retain control, and get a full audit trail
    with secure data handling.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on a high-impact local route. Transitional: Get a
    quick ROI estimate and integration checklist.
  success: >-
    Reduced detention hours and fees, higher on-time performance, more turns per
    truck/day, happier drivers and facilities, fewer phone calls, calmer
    dispatch, and higher revenue per day.
  failure: >-
    Persisting detention and missed docks, idle trucks and overtime, strained
    shipper/receiver relationships, stressed drivers, and lost loads.
