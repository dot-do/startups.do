leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone collection of COAs, sanitation logs, BOLs, and
      temperature records leads to scramble before SQF/HACCP/USDA-FSIS audits.
    - >-
      Missing or mismatched documentation (e.g., BOL/lot/COA linkage) delays
      shipments to large customers (Sysco/US Foods/Walmart) and risks
      chargebacks.
    - >-
      Siloed data across email, paper binders, ERP, EDI portals, and IoT
      temperature systems increases compliance risk and labor costs.
    - >-
      Limited QA staff must build dozens of customer-specific document packs
      weekly; typical pack assembly time is 2–4 hours each.
    - >-
      Reactive compliance (finding gaps days later) instead of proactive
      monitoring causes non-conformances and costly CAPAs.
    - >-
      Inconsistent checklists and version control across sites leads to audit
      findings and repeat issues.
    - >-
      Difficulty proving traceability and cold-chain control quickly during mock
      recalls or regulator spot-checks.
    - >-
      High onboarding friction for suppliers to send standardized COAs and
      sanitation attestations.
    - >-
      Lack of immutable audit trail and e-signature controls weakens
      defensibility during audits and investigations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion: auto-capture COAs, sanitation logs, BOLs, temp records,
      and supplier attestations via email, EDI/SFTP, API, mobile scan, and IoT
      integrations.
    - >-
      AI extraction and validation: OCR + meat-specific entity extraction
      (establishment numbers, species, cut codes, lot/serials, kill/pack dates,
      temp thresholds).
    - >-
      Smart linkage: reconcile COAs to lots/SKUs and BOLs; verify against ERP
      orders/invoices; flag mismatches in real time.
    - >-
      Checklist automation: build customer- and scheme-specific checklists (SQF
      codes, USDA-FSIS HACCP/SSOP/9 CFR 416/417) and track completion per pack.
    - >-
      Temperature chain assurance: ingest/harmonize logger/telematics data;
      auto-check hold/transport thresholds; attach excursions and CAPAs.
    - >-
      Pack assembly: one-click binder generation (PDF/portfolio + indexed
      evidence); secure portal sharing with customers/auditors.
    - >-
      Proactive gap alerts: reminders to suppliers for missing COAs; SLA timers;
      dashboard for overdue or at-risk packs.
    - >-
      Audit mode: immutable WORM storage, e-signatures, change logs, and
      evidence timelines; exportable audit trails.
    - >-
      Analytics: completeness rate, extraction accuracy, cycle-time, first-pass
      acceptance, non-conformance trends.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Assemble audit- and customer-ready compliance packs in minutes—not hours—by
    automatically collecting, validating, and linking meat-industry documents
    and temperature data to lots, with auditor-verified checklists and an
    immutable audit trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, auditor-validated dataset and rules tuned specifically for meat
    wholesalers (estab numbers, primal/subprimal mappings, cold-chain
    thresholds), prebuilt retailer/customer checklist templates, and deep
    integrations with common ERP/IoT stacks—creating high switching costs and
    superior first-pass acceptance rates.

      3) Generate: one-click customer/audit document packs with built-in checklists; flag gaps, assign tasks, and export PDF/zip.
    - Agreement Plan:
      - Keep your current forms—no rip-and-replace.
      - Clear data ownership and export-anytime.
      - Fast onboarding and team training.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a 14-day pilot or book a 20-minute demo.
