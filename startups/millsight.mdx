leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on looms, shearing lines, latex backing, and
      compressors causes 3–8% OEE loss and $1,000–$4,000 per hour in lost
      throughput and labor.
    - >-
      Historian data (motor current, temp, vibration proxies, runtime) is
      collected but not analyzed for early failure signatures; insights are
      retroactive, not predictive.
    - >-
      Maintenance teams are lean; manual trend checks across hundreds of motors
      are impractical and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Generic anomaly tools create too many false alarms in textiles due to
      recipe changes, yarn variability, and shift-to-shift behaviors.
    - >-
      Critical failures (bearings, belts, clogged cooling, misalignment, VFD
      issues) often show subtle current/heat patterns 2–24 hours prior but go
      undetected.
    - >-
      No closed loop to CMMS; alerts rarely become prioritized, data-backed work
      orders with defined inspections/spare parts.
    - >-
      Compressed air and motor inefficiencies go unnoticed; energy spend is
      10–20% higher than necessary in many mills.
    - >-
      Adoption risk: mills need value in <90 days with no new sensors and
      minimal IT/OT disruption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an edge agent that securely connects to existing historians (PI,
      Ignition, FactoryTalk, Wonderware) and PLC tags to stream motor current,
      temperature, vibration proxies, runtime/cycle counts, pressures, and
      speeds.
    - >-
      Learn per-asset fingerprints using robust anomaly detection (autoencoders
      + change-point + Isolation Forest) adapted to shift patterns, recipes, and
      ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Provide asset health scores, early warnings, and explainable features
      (e.g., phase imbalance in current, rising RMS, thermal drift) tuned for
      looms, shearing, latex lines, and compressors.
    - >-
      Integrate with CMMS (Maximo, Fiix, eMaint, SAP PM) to auto-create
      prioritized work orders with standardized inspection steps and spare BOM
      suggestions.
    - >-
      Energy and air module: detect compressor leaks, unload/idle inefficiency,
      motor overload; quantify kWh savings opportunities.
    - >-
      Operator and maintenance workflows: mobile-friendly alerts,
      snooze/acknowledge, feedback loop to label true/false alerts for continual
      learning.
    - >-
      Quarterly model refresh and reliability review: failure post-mortems,
      thresholds tuning, and targeted PM changes.
    - >-
      On-prem or VPC deployment options with role-based access and audit trails
      for air-gapped mills.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut unplanned downtime 20–30% in 90 days without adding sensors by turning
    existing historian logs into asset-specific early warnings (median 1–4 hours
    lead time) with targeted inspections, <3% alert false-positive rate, and
    direct CMMS work orders.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Textile-specific models and playbooks trained on historian patterns unique
    to looms/shearing/latex lines; rapid integration without new sensors; OEM/SI
    partnerships and early references in major carpet hubs enabling fast,
    low-risk pilots and quick proof of value.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers and maintenance leads at carpet and rug mills who must keep
    looms, shearing lines, latex backing, and compressors running without
    surprises.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned stops and off-quality caused by hidden motor current,
    temperature, vibration-proxy, and runtime anomalies that manual trending
    misses; historian data is noisy and underused. Internal: Tired of
    firefighting, overtime, and scrap when issues could have been seen earlier.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t be blindsided by failures when the machines
    already tell you they’re in distress.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand mill cadence, narrow margins, and how a single line
    down can wreck schedules and quality. Authority: Built by manufacturing data
    engineers with deep historian experience; uses industry-standard anomaly
    detection on motor current, temperature, vibration proxies, and runtime;
    integrates with common historians (PI, Wonderware, Ignition, SQL) and
    existing alerts/CMMS.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect read-only to your historian and define assets/tags. 2)
    Train and validate models on your history; tune thresholds with your team.
    3) Go live with prioritized alerts, root-cause clues, and weekly health
    reports to email/Teams/CMMS. Agreement: Clear data-security and access
    controls; transparent pricing; start with a small-scope pilot and expand on
    results.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery and start a 60-day pilot.
    Transitional: Download a sample health report and the “12 tags that predict
    loom downtime” checklist.
  success: >-
    Fewer unplanned stops; early warning on bearings, misalignment, overheating,
    and compressor inefficiency; steadier quality and less scrap on looms,
    shearing, and latex backing; optimized maintenance timing; reduced overtime;
    confident schedules; a clear ROI path from existing historian data.
  failure: >-
    Keep flying blind; reactive breakdowns on critical assets; missed orders and
    rush costs; wasted yarn and latex; rising energy from struggling
    compressors; safety risks; eroding customer trust.
