  problem:
    - >-
      Hidden grain loss from suboptimal combine settings routinely costs
      0.5–2.0% of yield per field, often unnoticed until post-harvest analysis.
    - >-
      Operator skill and field conditions vary hour-to-hour (moisture, slope,
      residue load, crop variety), making manual tuning slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Mechanical anomalies (bearing wear, belt slip, chopper imbalance, sieve
      overload) are detected late, leading to unplanned downtime during critical
      harvest windows.
    - >-
      Existing OEM loss monitors and automation are siloed by brand, often
      heuristic-based, and rarely provide cross-fleet benchmarking or quantified
      ROI per field.
    - >-
      Farm managers lack a unified, actionable view across mixed-brand fleets to
      understand loss hot-spots, operator performance, and machine health in
      real time.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize combine CAN/ISOBUS telemetry (rotor speed, concave,
      fan, sieve, ground speed, header speed/height, engine load, grain flow,
      return volume, loss sensors, moisture, slope, temps, vibration).
    - >-
      AI models estimate instantaneous and rolling loss risk by component
      (header, rotor, separation, shoe) using crop and condition context;
      provide confidence scores.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection (supervised + unsupervised) for early signs: bearing
      vibration patterns, belt slip (speed deltas vs load), sieve overload
      (return vs loss), chopper imbalance (vibration harmonics), engine/drive
      anomalies (temp and load correlations).
    - >-
      Action recipes: “Increase fan +50 rpm,” “Tighten concave 2 mm,” “Reduce
      ground speed 0.3 mph,” “Raise header 1.5 cm on slope,” prioritized by
      ROI/minute and safety constraints.
    - >-
      Operator UX: in-cab mobile app and browser with low-latency alerts (<5 s),
      haptic/voice prompts, offline caching; fleet dashboard for managers with
      per-field benchmarking and automated end-of-day harvest report.
    - >-
      Calibration workflows: optional drop-pan test and sample weigh-ins to
      align model to each machine/crop; continuous learning tightens
      recommendations during the season.
    - >-
      Integrations: JDLink/Operations Center, AFS Connect, CLAAS TELEMATICS,
      AGCO Connect via APIs where available; CSV/API export to farm management
      tools.
    - >-
      Edge option: small plug-in telematics module for older/air-gapped
      machines; stores and syncs when back on network.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, cross-brand AI that converts raw combine telemetry into
    quantified loss and anomaly alerts with step-by-step corrective actions,
    cutting harvest losses by 0.5–1.0 percentage points and reducing unplanned
    downtime by 10–20%, delivered on the devices operators already use.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-brand, crop-specific dataset of labeled loss and anomaly events tied
    to precise corrective actions, collected through multi-OEM pilots and
    calibration protocols; proprietary normalization of settings across brands;
    closed-loop learning that links recommendation, operator action, and
    measured outcome to continuously outperform OEM heuristics.
