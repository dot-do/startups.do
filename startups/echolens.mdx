  problem:
    - >-
      Consulting teams waste 30–50% of project hours manually coding and
      summarizing unstructured feedback from surveys, support tickets, and call
      transcripts.
    - >-
      Insights arrive too late (2–6 weeks) to influence decisions, pilots, or
      quarterly business reviews, reducing perceived value and upsell potential.
    - >-
      Inconsistent, subjective coding across analysts leads to low
      reproducibility and client skepticism in executive readouts.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (Qualtrics/Medallia surveys, Zendesk/ServiceNow tickets,
      CCaaS call transcripts, HR pulse surveys) prevents holistic root-cause
      analysis and prioritization.
    - >-
      Difficulty moving from themes to quantified drivers and prioritized
      actions tied to KPIs (NPS/CSAT, churn, AHT, adoption, eNPS, attrition).
    - >-
      Limited multilingual coverage and domain adaptation (financial services,
      healthcare, telecom, B2B SaaS) weakens global program insights.
    - >-
      Compliance/privacy risk when moving PII and sensitive employee data across
      vendors without strong controls (GDPR/CCPA, DSAR readiness, DLP).
    - >-
      Scaling analysis across dozens of concurrent client projects strains
      margins, senior reviewer bandwidth, and quality assurance.

      seed terms and ontology import (industry templates included).
    - >-
      Aspect-based sentiment and emotion classification with calibration for
      survey scales (e.g., map free-text to NPS/CSAT drivers).
    - >-
      Root-cause and driver analysis linking themes to KPIs using interpretable
      models (GBMs/GLMs with SHAP), lift analysis, and counterfactual what-ifs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    A consulting leader who must turn messy customer and employee feedback into
    clear, client-ready recommendations that drive measurable change.
  problem: >-
    External: Disparate surveys, tickets, and transcripts make insight mining
    slow and error-prone. Internal: Teams worry they’re missing patterns and
    root causes. Philosophical: Decisions should be led by the voices of
    customers and employees—not anecdotes.
  guide: >-
    We’re consultants and data scientists who’ve synthesized millions of
    feedback records for mid-market and enterprise clients. We understand the
    pressure to deliver credible, fast insights and provide secure, transparent
    AI you can explain to stakeholders.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your data securely; 2) AI mines themes, sentiment, and root
    causes; 3) Receive prioritized actions, dashboards, and enablement; 4) Track
    impact and iterate.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery call. Transitional: Get a free sample
    insight pack using your data (NDA-ready).
  success: >-
    Deliver evidence-backed recommendations in days; reveal root-cause maps;
    prioritize high-impact fixes; lift CSAT/EX; reduce churn/attrition; win and
    expand accounts with a scalable insight engine.
  failure: >-
    Continue guessing from anecdotes, burn weeks on manual coding, miss systemic
    issues, erode client confidence, and leave value—and revenue—on the table.
