leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Underground utility conflicts are routinely missed during preconstruction
      because utility sheets are dense, inconsistent across utilities, and
      spread across dozens of plan PDFs, causing late RFIs, redesign, and field
      delays.
    - >-
      Site prep contractors lack a fast, standardized way to translate plan
      utility information into constructible trench sequences, shoring
      requirements, and potholing priorities that align with safety (OSHA
      Subpart P) and schedule.
    - >-
      Manual review in Bluebeam/CAD takes 8–20 hours per project and still
      misses crossings, abandoned lines, or easement constraints; this leads to
      change orders (1–3% of site package value) and schedule slips (1–5 days).
    - >-
      Utility strikes and near-misses are costly and dangerous; CGA estimates
      annual US impacts in the tens of billions. Even one strike can cost
      $25k–$200k in direct costs plus schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE) results often arrive late or are not
      integrated into constructible trench sequences, leaving field crews to
      improvise.
    - >-
      Estimators and PMs struggle to justify potholing scope without quantified
      risk; owners and GCs push back without a data-backed prioritization of
      targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated parsing of utility sheets (PDF/digital) to identify existing and
      proposed utilities, elevations, materials, and conflicts (crossings,
      parallel proximity, clearances).
    - >-
      Probabilistic depth inference and tolerance bands using plan notes,
      typical sections, and regional standards to highlight likely conflict
      zones.
    - >-
      Constructible trench sequencing engine that groups runs by utility type,
      depth, traffic control zones, and production rates to minimize rework and
      crossings.
    - >-
      Shoring recommendations mapped to OSHA Subpart P with library of soil
      types, trench depth, and slope/shield options; outputs bill of shoring and
      daily setup guidance.
    - >-
      Potholing target prioritization that ranks verification points by impact
      probability and consequence; generates a potholing plan with quantities
      and suggested methods (vac, hand, daylight).
    - >-
      Integration of SUE/GPR results and as-builts to update conflict map and
      re-sequence automatically as new info arrives.
    - >-
      Export to Civil 3D, MicroStation, CAD layers, and Procore/Autodesk Build
      with issue markers and RFI templates.
    - >-
      Field-ready views (mobile) with GPS reference, conflict callouts, and
      daily work plans for foremen.
    - >-
      Audit trail and QA: precision/recall metrics per plan set, reviewer
      overrides, and stamped summary by PE (optional service).
    - >-
      Turnaround SLA: 24–48 hours for typical 10–30 sheet utility packages; rush
      option under 12 hours.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that parses utility plans into a constructible work plan: detects
    conflicts, optimizes trench sequences, recommends shoring by soil/depth, and
    prioritizes potholing targets in under 24 hours—cutting RFIs by 20–40%,
    avoiding 1–2% in sitework change orders, and reducing utility hit risk by
    30%+ on first year deployments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving dataset linking detected conflicts to verified
    field outcomes (from SUE, potholing, and as-built reports), combined with a
    trench sequencing optimizer calibrated to real contractor production rates
    and a shoring ruleset aligned to OSHA and manufacturer data. Early insurer
    partnerships that reward usage with premium credits create a sticky economic
    moat and make displacement difficult.

  character: >-
    A site preparation contractor who must plan safe, clash‑free trenching and
    deliver on time and budget.
  problem: >-
    Villain: fragmented utility data, messy PDFs, and late locates. External:
    hidden conflicts cause strikes, RFIs, rework, and schedule slips. Internal:
    teams feel blind and forced to guess trench sequences and shoring.
    Philosophical: crews shouldn’t risk safety or profit because information is
    buried in plans.
  guide: >-
    We understand the stress of digging near live utilities with incomplete
    information. Utility Conflict Finder and Trenching Plan uses AI to parse
    utility plans, flag conflicts, and propose trench sequences, shoring needs,
    and potholing targets so you can plan with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload utility plans and scope. 2) Receive a conflict map with proposed
    trench sequence, shoring needs, and potholing targets. 3) Review, adjust,
    and export to your bid, schedule, and field package.

    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo for your next bid. Transitional: Download a
    sample conflict report.
  success: >-
    Zero surprises in the trench, safer crews, fewer RFIs and change orders,
    faster production, predictable schedules, stronger bids, and happier owners.
  failure: >-
    Missed conflicts, utility strikes, stop‑work delays, claims and fines, blown
    schedules, and lost profit.
