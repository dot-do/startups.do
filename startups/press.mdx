leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Energy spend is one of the top variable costs; plants lack forward-looking
      kWh/part estimates to optimize schedules and avoid peak demand charges
    - >-
      Press overloads and near-misses cause unplanned downtime, accelerated die
      wear, and safety risks due to inaccurate load assumptions
    - >-
      Process planning often relies on expert heuristics; suboptimal press
      selection and parameter settings lead to higher scrap, longer setup, and
      lower OEE
    - >-
      Limited visibility of the tonnage curve over stroke before a run;
      engineers cannot test ‘what-if’ scenarios quickly
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across PLCs, historians, MES, and spreadsheets; it is
      hard to turn it into actionable predictions for planned jobs
    - >-
      Rising variability in material properties, billet temperature,
      lubrication, and die condition makes static process sheets unreliable
    - >-
      Energy and sustainability targets (ISO 50001, Scope 2) require measurable,
      per-part energy baselines and continuous improvement
    - >-
      Expert workforce shortages make it difficult to scale best practices
      across shifts, cells, and plants
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest planned run inputs: part geometry (CAD or features), alloy/grade,
      billet size and temperature, lubrication, reduction schedule, target
      throughput, and available presses
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models predict tonnage vs stroke and kWh/part; flag
      overload risk windows versus press capacity/energy constraints
    - >-
      Recommend optimal press, ram speed, blow count, dwell, reduction per blow,
      billet temperature window, and lubrication strategy
    - >-
      Run ‘what-if’ simulations to evaluate alternate presses, cycle times, and
      process parameters; quantify energy, load, OEE, and die-life impact
    - >-
      Integrate with scheduling/MES to align runs to low-tariff windows and
      minimize demand peaks; export machine-ready parameter sets and limits
    - >-
      Edge gateway connects to PLC/SCADA/historian for closed-loop monitoring;
      compares predictions to live data to auto-tune models over time
    - >-
      Generate per-part energy baselines, load compliance reports, and audit
      trails for ISO 50001 and customer PPAP documentation
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predicts tonnage curve and kWh/part pre-run and recommends press and
    settings to cut energy 5–12%, eliminate 50–80% overload near-misses, reduce
    setup time 10–20%, and extend die life 5–15%—with <8% error on peak tonnage
    and <8% error on kWh/part for qualified use cases.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-OEM dataset of labeled load and energy profiles combined
    with proprietary physics-informed ML models and prebuilt integrations
    enables accurate pre-run predictions and prescriptive settings at low data
    volumes—hard for generic EMS or FEA-only competitors to replicate. OEM
    distribution and embedded scheduling/energy optimization further entrench
    adoption.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Forge shop managers, process/manufacturing engineers, and schedulers at iron
    & steel forges who want to plan runs that hit throughput, quality, and
    energy targets—without trial-and-error.
  problem: >-
    External: Uncertain press loads and kWh/part, mismatched press selection,
    manual estimates, costly trials, volatile energy prices, and tight delivery
    windows. Internal: Pressure to commit without data, fear of damaging
    presses/dies, and constant firefighting from late changes. Philosophical:
    Planning a heat shouldn’t be guesswork—heavy industry deserves predictive
    clarity.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know every heat carries real risk—settings that are slightly off
    can cost time, money, and equipment health. Authority: Our team blends
    forging, metallurgy, and AI. The Forecaster learns from your press curves
    and historical runs to predict tonnage curves and kWh/part, then recommends
    press and settings. Validated against past jobs, integrates with ERP/PLCs,
    and built privacy-first.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: historical press data + ERP; upload part/route. 2)
    Forecast: tonnage curve, kWh/part, optimal press & settings; review
    constraints/sensitivities. 3) Execute & learn: publish to work instructions,
    monitor actual vs. forecast, auto-refine. Risk-free: pilot on one job, keep
    your data, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and pilot your next run. Transitional: Get
    a free backtest on a past job, download a sample forecast report, or use the
    ROI/energy savings estimator.
  success: >-
    Confident plans with accurate load and energy predictions; right press,
    first time; fewer overstress events and changeovers; improved throughput;
    more reliable quotes; on-time delivery with lower kWh/part; clear ESG energy
    intensity reporting; stronger margins.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing loads and energy, leading to mis-press events, equipment wear,
    blown energy budgets, scrap and rework, missed delivery dates, lost bids,
    and avoidable emissions.
