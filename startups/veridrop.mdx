  title: Proof-of-Delivery (POD) Validation & Fraud Detection
  description: >-
    Automated inspection of POD photos/signatures/geotags to verify delivery,
    detect tampering, and flag anomalies for review.
  targetUsers:
    - Ops quality teams
    - Finance/claims
    - Client success
  triggers:
    - POD image/signature uploaded
    - Client dispute raised
  inputs:
    - POD photo or signature
    - Timestamp/GPS/EXIF
    - Order recipient details
    - Driver/device ID
  steps:
    - 1) Retrieve POD assets via webhook
    - 2) OCR recipient names and parse EXIF/GPS
    - '3) Check scene consistency (address markers, time-of-day)'
    - 4) Compare to order metadata; compute trust score
    - '5) Flag anomalies (duplicates, edits, mismatched GPS)'
    - 6) Route to human reviewer; finalize disposition
  tools:
    - AWS Textract/Google Vision
    - OpenCV/EXIF parsers
    - Rekognition/Image hashing
    - S3/Cloud Storage
    - TMS webhooks
  outputs:
    - POD trust score and pass/fail
    - Annotated review report
    - Dispute pack for clients
  pricingModel:
    - Per-POD processed
    - Tiered monthly bundles
    - Optional chargeback recovery bounty

  problem:
    - >-
      High rate of false or disputed deliveries (1–3% of orders) leads to
      credits/chargebacks, re-deliveries, and lost NPS.
    - >-
      Manual review of POD photos/signatures is slow and inconsistent; ops teams
      spend 10–20 hours/week per 1,000 deliveries on disputes.
    - >-
      Drivers sometimes reuse old photos, use stock images, or spoof GPS; simple
      EXIF checks miss sophisticated tampering.
    - >-
      Existing ePOD systems validate “presence” (a photo exists) but not
      authenticity, location congruence, or chain-of-custody.
    - >-
      Signature collection lacks liveness checks and authenticity scoring;
      forged scribbles pass as proof.
    - >-
      Geotags and timestamps can be spoofed; no cross-sensor validation
      (barometer, magnetometer, Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, cell) to confirm
      location/time.
    - >-
      Lack of auditable, standardized evidence for insurance/regulatory needs
      increases claim friction and payouts.
    - >-
      Integration complexity: ops leaders need a drop-in SDK/API that adds
      verification without replatforming.
  solution:
    - >-
      Drop‑in mobile SDK and REST API that capture photos/signatures with
      cryptographic signing, device attestation, and secure metadata; sends
      artifacts for scoring in <500 ms P95.
    - >-
      AI models analyze image authenticity (copy‑move, splice, resampling),
      detect photo reuse via perceptual hashes, validate geotag/time vs route
      plan and sensor fusion; produce a 0–100 risk score with reasons.
    - >-
      Signature liveness and authenticity scoring; optional historical matching
      per recipient or consignment.
    - >-
      Rules engine + webhooks to auto-approve low risk, require extra step for
      medium risk (2nd photo or driver note), and route high risk to review
      console.
    - >-
      Ops console for human-in-the-loop review, bulk triage, and evidence packs
      exportable to customers/insurers.
    - >-
      Analytics: driver risk profiles, hotspot locations/times, SKU/category
      fraud trends; A/B testing to quantify impact on disputes and CS tickets.
    - >-
      Prebuilt integrations with popular ePOD/TMS/route platforms to minimize
      engineering lift; onboarding in days not months.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real‑time, forensic‑grade POD verification that proves “this package was
    delivered here, then, by this device” and flags anomalies before they become
    disputes—reducing delivery credits/chargebacks by 30–60% and cutting
    investigation time by 70–90%, with explainable AI and a defensible audit
    trail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-network fraud intelligence and a growing proprietary dataset of
    tampered and authentic POD artifacts; secure capture SDK that
    cryptographically binds image/signature to time, location, and device;
    explainable risk scoring tuned for last‑mile use cases; and embedded
    distribution via ePOD/TMS partners and insurers that raises switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Local messenger and same‑day delivery operators (ops managers, dispatchers,
    owner‑operators) who need reliable, defensible proof of delivery without
    slowing routes.
  problem: >-
    External: fake/altered photos, forged signatures, spoofed geotags. Internal:
    hours lost to disputes and manual checks. Philosophical: honest operators
    shouldn’t lose revenue or trust because PODs can be faked.
  guide: >-
    We understand last‑mile pressure and tight client SLAs. Our AI verifies POD
    photos, signatures, and geotags, detecting tampering and anomalies with
    explainable checks and an easy, workflow‑friendly interface.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect via API or upload PODs. 2) Set validation rules and thresholds
    (geofence, time window, tamper tests). 3) AI scores and flags anomalies for
    quick review; results sync back to your systems with a feedback loop to
    improve over time.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot with your own PODs or book a 15‑minute demo.
    Transitional: Get the POD Fraud Playbook and sample validation rules.
  success: >-
    Fewer chargebacks and disputes, faster approvals and payouts, audit‑ready
    evidence for clients, stronger trust and SLA compliance, reduced manual
    review, better driver coaching, protected margins.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing revenue leakage from fraud and errors, manual review overload,
    missed SLAs, client churn, and elevated compliance and insurance risk.
