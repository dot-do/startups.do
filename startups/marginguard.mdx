  problem:
    - >-
      Margin leakage from manual price overrides and inconsistent discounting by
      reps leads to 200–500 bps gross margin erosion.
    - >-
      Volatile supplier costs (steel, asphalt, PVC, aluminum, glass) cause
      outdated price matrices; dealers react slowly, compressing margins or
      losing quotes.
    - >-
      Channel inconsistency: walk-in/counter, outside sales, phone quotes, and
      eCommerce all run different pricing playbooks, confusing customers and
      harming trust.
    - >-
      Slow approval cycles: managers spend hours daily reviewing quotes with no
      standard guardrails; quotes expire or go cold.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true profitability after freight, rebates, and
      handling; reps price on cost alone rather than landed/net cost.
    - >-
      eCommerce growth outpaces pricing governance—no dynamic rules to protect
      margins online while remaining competitive.
    - >-
      Product family complexity (thousands of SKUs with long-tail demand) makes
      maintaining price lists and floors unmanageable in spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Existing ERP pricing modules are rigid; enterprise price-optimization
      tools are too costly/complex for mid-market dealers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest historical transactions, costs, rebates, freight and
      customer/product hierarchies from ERP; normalize landed cost and classify
      product families.
    - >-
      Generate AI-driven price recommendations at the intersection of product
      family × customer segment × channel with elasticity-aware uplift targets.
    - >-
      Enforce real-time guardrails and approvals in quoting and eCommerce: hard
      floors, soft floors with manager approval, and customer-specific
      exceptions.
    - >-
      Continuously monitor cost changes and competitive signals; auto-reprice
      matrices and publish safe online price bands.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards for margin leakage, override behavior, win-rate vs.
      recommendation, and channel price consistency.
    - >-
      Deliver a playbook-driven rollout: 2–4 week pilot in 1–2 branches, A/B
      test guardrails, then scale network-wide with training and change
      management.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Stop margin leakage and speed quotes with an AI-driven pricing engine
    purpose-built for building material dealers—pre-integrated to your ERP,
    enforcing smart margin floors by channel, customer, and product family in
    4–8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built for building material dealers with preconfigured product
    family taxonomies, guardrail templates, and ERP-native integrations,
    enabling a 4–8 week time-to-value and measurable ROI guarantees—faster and
    lighter than enterprise suites, yet stronger governance than generic CPQ or
    spreadsheets.
