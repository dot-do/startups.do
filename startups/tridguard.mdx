leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual QC of Closing Disclosures (CDs) and settlement statements is slow
      (15–30 minutes per file) and error-prone, driving re-disclosures, curative
      work, and strained lender relationships.
    - >-
      Fee miscalculations (title premiums, endorsements, recording, transfer
      taxes) and TRID tolerance breaches trigger cure payments, refunds, and
      post-close corrections; baseline error incidence is estimated at 2–5% of
      files.
    - >-
      State-mandated disclosure requirements and filed rate/fee rules change
      frequently across 50 states and DC; keeping rule libraries current is
      costly and inconsistent across branches/agents.
    - >-
      Current Title Production System (TPS) rule checks are limited to static
      validations; they do not fully reconcile TRID sections, state disclosures,
      municipal fees, and filed rates against a single source of truth.
    - >-
      Regulatory exams (CFPB/MBA/DOI) and investor diligence require auditable
      evidence of pre-close QC and post-close sampling; many carriers lack
      consistent, defensible digital audit trails.
    - >-
      High-volume periods (seasonality/cycle swings) exacerbate staffing needs;
      scaling QA teams +/- 30–50% is costly and time-consuming.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated CD/TRID engine that ingests MISMO v3.4/3.5 data or PDFs,
      reconciles Sections A–J, calculates TRID tolerances, and flags cures prior
      to consummation.
    - >-
      Filed rate and fee verification: cross-checks title premiums/endorsements
      against carrier rate manuals, promulgated rates, and filed service fees by
      state/county.
    - >-
      State-mandated disclosure validation: ensures presence, content accuracy,
      and placement of state-specific disclosures (e.g., TIRSA/NYS DFS notices,
      Florida per-line items, Texas promulgated endorsements).
    - >-
      Exception management workflow: assigns, comments, and resolves flags;
      provides root-cause codes for operational feedback loop.
    - >-
      Regulatory-grade audit trail: immutable evidence files with versioned CDs,
      calculation artifacts, and decision logs for DOI/CFPB exams and lender
      audits.
    - >-
      Deployment options: API for TPS integration (SoftPro, RamQuest, ResWare,
      Qualia), batch SFTP for legacy workflows, and a web console for manual
      uploads; sub-5 second response for digital files, <60 seconds for OCR
      PDFs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Zero-lag, auditable CD/TRID compliance QC for title carriers: 2-minute
    automated review, 98%+ precision on fee and tolerance checks, real-time
    state disclosure validation, and a regulator-ready audit trail—reducing
    cure/refund exposure and manual review costs by 60–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deeply versioned, regulator-auditable evidence generation tied to each CD
    decision, combined with filed-rate/endorsement logic co-developed with
    leading underwriters and embedded TPS integrations—creating switching costs
    and compliance defensibility competitors lack.
