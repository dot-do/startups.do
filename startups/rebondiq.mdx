leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High, variable scrap streams (mixed densities, chemistries, colors) make
      consistent rebond recipes hard to plan, causing off-spec lots and rework.
    - >-
      Binder is the largest controllable consumable in rebonding; plants
      typically run 8–12% binder by weight to stay safe, leaving 5–15% savings
      on the table.
    - >-
      Manual mix planning and fixed press schedules lead to long changeovers,
      uneven cure, and 5–15% lost throughput.
    - >-
      Scrap bales accumulate and age, creating inventory carrying costs,
      moisture variability, and quality drift that are not captured in planning.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true yield, cost per cubic meter, and CO2e avoided
      prevents plants from prioritizing the most profitable and sustainable
      runs.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across scales, grinders, presses, lab QA, and ERP; no
      single source of truth to optimize end-to-end.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration layer that ingests bale weights, scrap attributes,
      grinder throughput, moisture, density, lab QA, binder lots, and press
      cycles from PLC/MES/ERP.
    - >-
      Blend optimizer that selects scrap mixes and binder rates to meet target
      density/IFD/CR while minimizing binder cost and changeovers; includes
      “what-if” simulation and guardrails for safety/spec.
    - >-
      Press schedule optimizer that sequences runs to minimize color/chemistry
      changeovers, align with curing times, and balance energy and throughput.
    - >-
      Closed-loop binder dosing guidance using real-time scrap characteristics
      (moisture, particle size distribution) and press temperature to control
      cure profile.
    - >-
      Quality prediction and early-warning models for density/IFD variance and
      delamination risk; triggers on-line adjustments or quarantines lots.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware planning that prioritizes aging bales and aligns
      production with sales/OTIF, reducing scrap inventory days by 20–40%.
    - >-
      Edge gateway for plants without modern MES, with optional
      vision/weight/moisture sensors to classify scrap and track bale genealogy.
    - >-
      Dashboards and KPIs: yield, binder kg/m3, cost per m3, OEE, schedule
      adherence, CO2e avoided; automated COA/traceability.
    - >-
      Secure cloud plus on-prem edge; APIs and connectors for SAP, Infor, QAD,
      Microsoft Dynamics, Ignition SCADA, and OPC-UA PLCs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn trim/grind scrap into planned, profitable rebond output. Cut binder
    5–12%, increase press throughput 8–15%, and reduce off-spec by 30–50% with
    AI-driven mixing, dosing, and scheduling. Payback in under 6 months at
    typical plant scale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization that ties recipe, dosing, and press schedule into
    one system, trained on cross-plant datasets and validated with binder
    suppliers and OEMs. As deployments grow, the dataset and tuned models become
    defensible and hard to replicate.

  character: >-
    Foam plant leaders in NAICS 326150 who want predictable, profitable rebond
    from trim/grind scrap.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable scrap streams, binder costs, and press bottlenecks make rebond
    planning guesswork—wasting material, time, and margin. It shouldn’t be hard
    to keep scrap out of landfill and still hit spec.
  guide: >-
    An AI planning partner built for urethane and other foam (except
    polystyrene). We understand shop-floor realities and data constraints,
    combining process know-how with optimization and secure integrations.
  plan: >-
    3 steps: 1) Assess scrap streams and targets; 2) Connect data (scales,
    grinders, ERP) and calibrate; 3) Generate optimized mixes, binder usage, and
    press schedules—run, monitor, and continuously improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute plant assessment, or request the rebond planning
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Scrap becomes scheduled feedstock; mixes hit density/firmness targets;
    binder use is optimized; presses run fuller and on time; traceability
    improves; sustainability and margin goals are met.
  failure: >-
    Scrap piles grow, binder and virgin usage stay high, presses idle or miss
    windows, quality drifts, and landfill fees and lost margin continue.
