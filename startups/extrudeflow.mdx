  problem:
    - >-
      Production planners in unlaminated plastics film and sheet plants spend
      2–6 hours per day in Excel juggling orders, machine constraints, and
      tribal rules; schedules are fragile and hard to update when rush orders
      arrive.
    - >-
      Changeovers (resin, color, width/gauge, die/screw/tooling) consume 10–25%
      of available line time in typical plants; each major changeover can take
      1–6 hours and scrap 200–1,000 kg of resin.
    - >-
      On-time delivery is volatile: many plants run 75–90% OTD with frequent
      expedite freight to hit dates, raising logistics costs by 5–15% on late
      orders.
    - >-
      Constraints are complex and dynamic (tooling availability, minimum
      campaign sizes, corona/treatment, co-extrusion layer compatibility,
      operator qualifications, maintenance windows), making manual optimization
      infeasible at scale.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MES scheduling modules are generic; they don’t model
      changeover matrices or family sequencing well, leading to more setups than
      necessary and increased lateness.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and quality holds require rapid re-optimization;
      current tools/documents cannot re-run a feasible, plant-realistic schedule
      in minutes, leading to line idling or suboptimal sequencing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Domain-specific optimization engine (mixed-integer/constraint programming)
      tuned for extrusion sequencing with explicit changeover costs for resin,
      color, width/gauge, tooling, and treatment steps.
    - >-
      Auto-generated changeover matrix builder that infers setup times/scrap
      from BOM/specs and learns from historical run and QC data; supports manual
      overrides by planners.
    - >-
      ERP/MES connectors (SAP, Oracle, Epicor, DELMIAworks/IQMS, Infor, Plex) to
      ingest orders, routings, inventory/tooling, maintenance; write-back of
      confirmed schedules and priorities.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization on events (hot order, machine down, quality
      hold) with soft/hard locks to preserve stable portions of the schedule.
    - >-
      Scenario planning sandbox: compare “as-is” vs campaign strategies,
      hot-order insertion, weekend overtime, or alternative line assignments
      with quantified impacts on changeovers, OTD, and scrap.
    - >-
      Operational KPI cockpit: on-time/late forecast, changeover hours, expected
      scrap, line utilization, schedule adherence; alerts when constraints
      cannot be met.
    - >-
      90-day pilot playbook: data extraction and mapping, rules/changeover
      workshop, baseline KPI capture, parallel-run, and go-live with quantified
      ROI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
