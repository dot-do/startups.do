  problem:
    - >-
      Lead response time is too slow: median first response from teams is often
      15–60 minutes; best-in-class needs <60 seconds to maximize contact rate.
    - >-
      Agents and ISAs miss after-hours/weekend leads; 35–50% of portal leads
      arrive outside business hours.
    - >-
      Qualification is inconsistent; critical questions (timeline, financing,
      representation, location, price range) are not captured or synced to CRM.
    - >-
      Manual data entry and fragmented lead sources create operational drag and
      poor attribution.
    - >-
      No reliable process to instantly book appointments and round-robin across
      teams without back-and-forth.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (TCPA/A2P 10DLC/Do-Not-Call/quiet hours) are poorly
      managed across ad hoc texting solutions.
    - >-
      Teams lack visibility into which sources and scripts drive booked
      appointments and closed deals.
  solution:
    - >-
      Sub-60-second, multi-channel first touch (SMS-first with email/voice
      fallback) triggered from all major lead sources.
    - >-
      Adaptive real estate–specific conversation flows capturing timeline,
      location, price range, financing, current representation, and property
      interest.
    - >-
      Automated calendar booking with round-robin rules, agent availability, and
      live call transfer for hot leads.
    - >-
      Real-time CRM sync and enrichment (source, campaign, property context,
      tags, notes, score), plus deduplication.
    - >-
      Lead scoring and routing based on smart rules
      (price/timeline/financing/source quality/language).
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails by default: TCPA consent capture, opt-out handling,
      quiet hours by timezone, A2P 10DLC registered senders, DNC checks.
    - >-
      Analytics showing speed-to-first-touch, contact rate, qualification rate,
      appointments booked, show rate, and source ROI.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop escalation: handoff to ISA/agent when signals indicate
      confusion, urgency, or high deal value.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every lead into a conversation within seconds: AI qualifies in real
    time, enriches context, and books appointments directly to the right
    agent—24/7—while syncing clean data to your CRM and preserving compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A tuned, MLS-aware conversation engine with proven scripts by lead source,
    plus prebuilt deep integrations to top real estate CRMs and
