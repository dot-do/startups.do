leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Caseworkers spend 30–50% of their workweek on documentation, reducing time
      with children and families.
    - >-
      Notes are often incomplete or misaligned with state policy/CCWIS
      requirements, causing QA rework, corrective action plans, and audit risk.
    - >-
      Frequent policy updates and jurisdictional differences make it hard for
      staff to keep notes compliant without constant training.
    - >-
      Unstructured notes make supervision, handoffs, and court preparation
      inefficient; information is hard to find.
    - >-
      High staff turnover and heavy caseloads create inconsistent documentation
      quality and institutional knowledge loss.
    - >-
      PII is frequently over-shared in notes and attachments, creating privacy
      and breach risk.
    - >-
      Existing dictation tools lack child welfare-specific structure, compliance
      checks, and data residency controls needed by public agencies.
    - >-
      Mobile field work, multi-lingual visits, and time pressure lead to delayed
      or missing notes, impacting safety and service decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile and web dictation that converts visits into structured,
      state-aligned case notes mapped to CCWIS and local policy templates.
    - >-
      Real-time completeness and policy checks that prompt for missing facts
      (e.g., safety factors, consent status, mandated fields) before submission.
    - >-
      Automatic PII detection and configurable redaction aligned to HIPAA-like
      safeguards where applicable, state confidentiality rules, and agency
      policy.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-aware policy packs maintained by GuardianNotes with change
      alerts; supervisors can add local rules and templates.
    - >-
      Seamless export to existing case management systems via APIs/flat files
      (e.g., Casebook, Northwoods Traverse, Bonterra Apricot/ETO,
      Salesforce/Microsoft).
    - >-
      Offline-first mobile app with on-device encryption and optional on-device
      STT; background sync to GovCloud/private cloud.
    - >-
      Audit-ready provenance and version history: who captured what, when, and
      how (voice/text), with supervisor review workflows.
    - >-
      Multilingual support: transcribe and translate interviews; notes finalized
      in English with original language artifacts attached, per policy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Policy-aware dictation and note structuring for Child and Youth Services
    that turns voice or rough notes into complete, compliant, and redacted case
    notes—cutting documentation time by 40%+ while reducing audit and privacy
    risk. (Advisory only; not legal advice.)
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    library built with agency SMEs; deep integrations with leading case
    management systems; privacy-by-design architecture for government

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Child and Youth Services caseworkers and supervisors who want fast,
    defensible, policy-aligned case notes so they can focus on families.
  problem: >-
    External: scattered voice memos and rough notes, evolving policies, manual
    redaction, and high caseloads. Internal: anxiety about missing details, late
    notes, and audit risk. Philosophical: families deserve accurate, timely,
    privacy-protecting records.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of documentation under scrutiny. Our AI service,
    built with child welfare practitioners and security best practices, turns
    voice or rough notes into structured, policy-aligned case notes, runs
    missing-info checks, and redacts PII—backed by transparent logs and
    controls.
  plan: >-
    1) Capture: Dictate or upload notes; select your agency policy templates. 2)
    Structure & Check: AI organizes notes to your format, flags missing elements
    and compliance gaps, highlights risks, and auto‑redacts PII. 3) Review &
    Export: You edit and approve; export to your case system with an audit trail
    and version history. Data is encrypted; no training on your data without
    explicit approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a secure demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download the
    policy‑aligned note checklist and view sample redactions.
  success: >-
    Notes completed in minutes, consistently structured and compliant; fewer
    corrective actions; clean redactions; faster submissions; clearer narratives
    for courts and supervisors; reclaimed hours for client work; lower stress
    and burnout.
  failure: >-
    Persistent backlogs, inconsistent notes, privacy exposure, audit findings,
    court challenges, delayed services, and less time for families.
