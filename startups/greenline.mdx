leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Technicians spend 20–40% of repair time searching manuals, wiring
      diagrams, and past cases; information is fragmented across PDFs, portals,
      and local drives.
    - >-
      High season downtime is costly; inconsistent troubleshooting causes low
      first-time-fix rate and extended MTTR (mean time to repair).
    - >-
      Wrong or incomplete parts orders drive 10–25% returns, restocking fees,
      and lost machine uptime.
    - >-
      Dealers struggle to onboard new technicians quickly; ramp time to
      proficiency often exceeds 6–9 months.
    - >-
      OEM hotlines are overloaded; response times during peak season can exceed
      1–2 hours, delaying fixes.
    - >-
      Policy compliance (warranty, returns eligibility, order value limits) is
      difficult to enforce consistently during phone/email orders.
    - >-
      Manual order entry into DMS/ERP is error-prone; serial-number based
      supersessions and substitutions are missed.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multimodal retrieval-augmented copilot trained on service manuals,
      troubleshooting trees, and wiring diagrams; answers step-by-step with
      citations and highlights on diagrams.
    - >-
      Policy-aware parts ordering: validates serial number, warranty status,
      substitution/supersession, inventory, price, and order limits;
      auto-creates quotes/pick tickets in DMS/ERP for approval.
    - >-
      Interactive troubleshooters: symptom-based flows that adapt using
      telematics/diagnostic codes; logs steps completed for audit/warranty.
    - >-
      VIN/SN decoding and model variant awareness; recommends likely failure
      parts (BOM) with probabilities based on historical outcomes.
    - >-
      Returns and warranty guardrails: reason codes, eligibility checks, and RMA
      initiation within policy.
    - >-
      Offline-tolerant mobile and web apps with caching for poor connectivity;
      optional voice mode for hands-busy environments.
    - >-
      OEM/dealer helpdesk triage: deflects FAQs, enriches tickets with repro
      steps and logs, and routes complex cases with full context to L2/L3.
    - >-
      Analytics: parts attach rate, first-time-fix, return rates, technician
      usage, and knowledge gaps to inform training and stocking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI copilot that understands OEM manuals, wiring diagrams, and parts
    catalogs; guides technicians through diagnostics; and places
    policy-compliant parts orders directly in the dealer’s DMS—reducing MTTR,
    wrong-part returns, and support load while increasing parts revenue and
    first-time-fix rate.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A policy-aware parts and troubleshooting knowledge graph grounded in OEM
    source content and serial-number variants, connected to DMS ordering with
    closed-loop outcomes. Over time, proprietary feedback data (what fixed the
    issue, which parts returned, seasonal/region patterns) compounds to improve
    recommendations in ways generic copilots and static portals cannot.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      OEMs (Agricultural and off-road machinery manufacturers) needing to scale
      dealer technical support and parts revenue.
    - >-
      Dealer groups (multi-location farm equipment dealers) aiming to improve
      technician productivity and parts margin.
    - >-
      Independent service shops where policy allows (focus on diagnostics +
      guidance, limited ordering).
    - >-
      Parts managers and service advisors coordinating quotes, pick tickets, and
      warranties.
    - >-
      OEM and dealer helpdesk teams seeking case deflection and faster
      escalations.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct enterprise sales to OEMs for white-label and dealer network
      rollout; target top 5 OEMs by region first.
    - >-
      Partner with dealer associations (e.g., North American Equipment Dealers
      Association and EU counterparts) for webinars and pilot recruitment.
    - >-
      Co-sell and integrations with DMS/ERP vendors; placement in their
      marketplaces and joint reference implementations.
    - >-
      Field marketing at Agritechnica, CONEXPO/CON-AGG, World Ag Expo; live
      demos with dealer case studies.
    - >-
      Pilot-led land-and-expand: 8–12 week paid pilots with 3–5 dealer groups
      (50–200 tech seats each); convert to multi-year contracts based on ROI.
    - >-
      Content-led growth: how-to videos, ROI calculators, troubleshooting
      playbooks, and wiring diagram tips.
    - >-
      Customer success motions: quarterly business reviews with KPIs, stocking
      recommendations from insights, and upsell to AR/voice modules.
  revenueStreams:

    Dealer principals, service managers, and field technicians in farm machinery
    OEM networks who want faster, error‑free repairs and policy‑compliant parts
    ordering to keep growers running.
  problem: >-
    Complex equipment and scattered information slow diagnosis; parts catalogs
    and policies are hard to navigate; peak‑season pressure makes mistakes
    costly—downtime shouldn’t cost a harvest.

    authority as an AI assistant grounded in OEM service manuals, wiring
    diagrams, and parts catalogs, with secure, policy‑aware ordering and
    enterprise integration.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect manuals, wiring diagrams, parts catalogs, and policies; 2) Run a
    focused pilot with priority use cases and dealers; 3) Roll out with
    training, KPIs, and DMS/ERP integration—enable one‑click, policy‑compliant
    parts orders.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 4‑week pilot to see faster fixes and
    accurate orders on real machines.
  success: >-
    Higher first‑time fix rates, accurate parts the first time, shorter
    diagnostics, reduced downtime, compliant warranty/parts orders, captured
    tribal knowledge, 24/7 support, happier growers, and stronger service
