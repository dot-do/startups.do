  problem:
    - >-
      Job shops and contract manufacturers in NAICS 332999 rely on
      Excel/whiteboards or ERP’s infinite-capacity modules, leading to
      unrealistic promise dates and frequent firefighting.
    - >-
      Rush orders and disruptions (machine downtime, missing material, absent
      operators) cause daily re-plans that take 2–6 hours, and still produce
      infeasible schedules.
    - >-
      Setup/changeover times, skill constraints, tooling/fixture availability,
      and secondary ops (weld/paint/assembly/subcontracting) are not modeled
      accurately, resulting in excess WIP, overtime, and expediting.
    - >-
      Supervisors need clear, real-time dispatch lists by workcenter; instead,
      operators wait for instructions, causing idle time and priority confusion.
    - >-
      OTD performance is volatile (typical 70–90%), with premium freight and
      overtime masking schedule inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Schedulers lack scenario planning (what-if) and end up over-promising or
      under-utilizing capacity, impacting margins and customer trust.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with existing ERP/MES (jobs, routings, BOMs, calendars, due
      dates) and optionally machine/IoT signals (MTConnect/OPC-UA) within 2–4
      weeks.
    - >-
      Model true shop constraints: finite machines and crews, skill matrix,
      alternate routings, setup families, batching, tooling/fixture
      availability, maintenance windows, subcontract lead times, and shift
      patterns.
    - >-
      Run AI-guided optimization (hybrid CP-SAT + heuristics) to build a
      feasible, priority-aligned schedule with freeze windows and promised due
      dates.
    - >-
      Publish real-time dispatch lists to supervisors/operators by workcenter
      (web/mobile/kiosk), including setup notes, tooling requirements, and
      next-jobs queue.
    - >-
      Auto-reschedule on disruptions (machine down, scrap, late material) within
      defined rules; notify planners of conflicts and trade-offs.
    - >-
      Provide what-if scenario planning (rush order insertion, overtime, second
      shift, subcontract vs in-house) with KPI impact preview before committing.
    - >-
      Deliver KPI dashboards: OTD, schedule adherence, WIP days, utilization,
      average lateness, setup hours, expedite cost, planner time saved.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Metal-fab-specific finite-capacity scheduling that generates a feasible plan
    and live dispatch lists in minutes, continuously adapts to shop-floor
    changes, and improves OTD by 8–15 points while cutting expedite and planner
    time—without replacing your ERP.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A metal-fabrication–specific constraints library and solver heuristics tuned
    on thousands of real shop-floor operations, plus certified ERP connectors
    that enable a 2–4 week time-to-value and reliable live
    dispatching—capabilities generic APS tools and ERP schedulers struggle to
    deliver without long, costly customization.

  character: >-
    Operations and scheduling leaders at high‑mix/low‑volume fabricated metal
    product manufacturers (NAICS 332999) who want a reliable finite‑capacity
    schedule that keeps machines and crews synchronized and orders on time.
  problem: >-
    External: High‑mix routings, sequence‑dependent setups, shared
    machines/crews, vendor steps, and maintenance; ERP/MRP plans assume infinite
    capacity; hot jobs and change orders break the plan. Internal: Constant
    firefighting, overtime and expediting, and no single source of truth; the
    floor gets conflicting priorities. Philosophical: With the data you already
    have, your shop deserves a feasible, trusted schedule.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the job‑shop reality of lasers, brakes, weld, paint,
    assembly, and outsource loops. Authority: Domain experts in finite‑capacity
    optimization for metal fab with proven deployments that lift OTD and cut
    WIP; secure, supported, and measurable.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Integrate ERP/MES and map machines, crews, calendars, setups,
    tooling, materials, maintenance, and vendor constraints.

    - Calibrate: Build a digital twin, validate standards with leads, and agree
    on dispatch logic and priority rules.

    - Go live: Optimize continuously; publish shift‑level dispatch lists to each
    workcenter; update with real‑time feedback and weekly reviews.

    - No‑risk: 30‑day pilot with clear ROI targets, secure deployment, training,
    and an easy exit ramp.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo; Start a 30‑day pilot. Transitional: Get the
    Finite‑Capacity Scheduling Playbook for Metal Fab.
  success: |-
    - On‑time delivery and accurate promise dates
    - Higher throughput without extra overtime
    - Lower WIP and shorter lead times
    - Clear, trusted dispatch lists at every cell
    - Stable schedules that absorb hot jobs and changes
    - Calmer planners, aligned crews, happier customers
  failure: |-
    - Late orders, expediting, and margin erosion
    - Overtime burn and burnout
    - Bottleneck whiplash and idle time waiting on crew/material/tooling
    - Spreadsheet chaos and finger‑pointing
    - “Infinite‑capacity” plans no one trusts
