  problem:
    - >-
      Airports and border agencies face unpredictable passenger surges at
      security and immigration, causing SLA breaches, long queues, and
      penalties.
    - >-
      Staffing plans are built with spreadsheets and static curves, leading to
      over/under-staffing by 10–25% on peak days.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across AODB, flight status, airline load factors,
      sensor counts, and eGate eligibility; few tools unify this into lane-level
      forecasts and staffing.
    - >-
      Operational constraints (union rules, certifications, breaks, minimum
      manning per lane/eGate bank) are hard to encode and maintain in manual
      rosters.
    - >-
      Disruptions (late arrivals, cancellations, irregular ops) are not
      reflected quickly in staffing plans, causing avoidable queues and
      overtime.
    - >-
      Limited ability to simulate scenarios (e.g., add two eGates vs. open
      another manned lane) and build ROI-backed business cases.
    - >-
      Executives lack reliable, comparable KPIs (MAPE, SLA breach minutes, cost
      per passenger) to track continuous improvement and defend budgets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion and forecasting: Combine flight schedules (AODB), real-time
      status (OAG/Cirium), airline load factors, nationality mix, eGate
      eligibility, and sensor counts to forecast passengers at each
      checkpoint/immigration desk per 5–15 minutes.
    - >-
      Prescriptive staffing recommendations: Convert forecasts to lane/desk
      opening plans and staff assignments with integer optimization, including
      breaks, skill tags (e.g., secondary screening), and minimum/maximum
      staffing rules.
    - >-
      Real-time replanning: Auto-update plans within 2–5 minutes of disruptions
      (late inbounds, gate changes) and push adjustments to supervisor tablets
      and WFM systems.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and what-if: Simulate service-level outcomes and
      staffing costs for alternative gate allocations, lane mixes, or eGate
      availability; support capex ROI for additional eGates/lanes.
    - >-
      SLA guardrails and alerts: Track live wait times vs targets (e.g., 95%
      under 10 minutes at security; 80% under 30 at immigration) and trigger
      recommended actions before breach.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations: Pre-built connectors to AODB/AMS (Amadeus, SITA),
      flight data (OAG/Cirium), queue sensors (Xovis, Veovo), WFM (UKG/Kronos,
      Quinyx), and access control for roster execution.
    - >-
      Auditability and compliance: Explainable forecasts, change logs, and
      policy libraries for labor rules, ensuring union and regulator compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Guarantee passenger wait-time SLAs at the lowest staffing cost with an
    integrated forecast-to-roster engine that predicts arrivals at 5–15 minute
    intervals and recommends lane-by-lane staffing, auto-adjusting in real time
    to disruptions while honoring labor and certification constraints.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop system that combines multi-source passenger forecasts with
    prescriptive lane/roster optimization and real-time replan, backed by a
    growing, cross-airport dataset of show-up curves and performance outcomes;
    pre-built integrations and labor-compliance libraries reduce time-to-value
    and switching costs. Outcome-based pricing aligned to SLA reductions further
    differentiates from analytics-only tools.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Airport operators (operations control centers, terminal managers,
      security checkpoint managers) at medium to mega hubs (1–70M pax/year).
    - >-
      Secondary: Government border agencies operating immigration checkpoints
      and eGates at international airports.
    - >-
      Security staffing providers/outsourcers (e.g., G4S, Securitas, ICTS)
      responsible for checkpoint staffing under SLAs.
    - >-

      (Europe, Middle East, LATAM) and hubs with complex transfer flows
      (NA/EU/Asia).
    - >-
      Early adopters: Airports with existing queue sensors
      (Xovis/Veovo/CrowdVision) or WFM systems (UKG/Kronos, Quinyx) and

      Direct enterprise sales to airport operators and border agencies with an
      8–12 week paid pilot playbook and outcome-based pricing.

  character: >-
    Airport operations leaders (terminal managers, checkpoint supervisors,
    immigration coordinators) who must keep queues short, meet SLAs, and control
    labor costs.
  problem: >-
    Unpredictable arrival surges create bottlenecks and SLA risk; manual
    scheduling relies on guesswork; staff burn out while passengers endure long,
    frustrating waits.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of queue-time KPIs, regulatory scrutiny, and
    union constraints. Our airport-ops and data science team builds AI that
    integrates with AODB, flight schedules, sensors, and rosters to forecast
    demand and recommend right-sized staffing.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: flights/AODB, historical throughput, e-gate counts,
    rosters, disruptions. 2) Forecast: passenger arrivals by checkpoint/lane in
    15–30 min intervals; test scenarios. 3) Act: receive lane-by-interval
    staffing recommendations honoring SLAs and constraints; publish to rosters;
    monitor and adjust with live alerts.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot at one checkpoint.
    Transitional: Download a sample forecast and readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Predictable wait times and SLA compliance; fewer overtime hours; balanced
    rosters and happier agents; efficient lane utilization; higher passenger
    satisfaction; defensible, data-driven plans.
  failure: >-
    Persistent long lines; missed SLAs and possible penalties; costly overtime
    and ad-hoc crisis staffing; staff burnout; negative passenger sentiment and
    reputational harm.
