  problem:
    - >-
      MAP violations on Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Google Shopping, and independent
      Shopify stores cause chronic price erosion (2–10% below MAP), harming
      margins and authorized dealer relationships.
    - >-
      Manual monitoring is labor-intensive (often 10–40 hrs/week) and misses
      violations during evenings/weekends and promo periods.
    - >-
      Evidence gathered by hand (screenshots without timestamps, missing
      shipping/tax details) is often rejected by marketplaces or fails to
      persuade violators.
    - >-
      Toy/hobby catalog complexity (bundles, multi-packs, limited editions,
      preorders, MAP holidays) leads to high false positives/negatives using
      generic tools.
    - >-
      Unauthorized sellers exploit loopholes (coupons, hidden-in-cart pricing,
      shipping manipulation, geolocation differences), making enforcement
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      No single source of truth for authorized resellers; staff lack confidence
      to escalate, and there’s no auditable trail of actions.
    - >-
      Slow time-to-detection and time-to-first-notice allow violators to win the
      buy box and trigger race-to-the-bottom pricing.
    - >-
      Limited legal resources and unclear escalation paths lead to stalled cases
      and repeat offenders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on marketplace monitoring across Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Google
      Shopping, Etsy, Target+, and Shopify stores, with anti-bot resilience and
      geo-aware pricing checks.
    - >-
      AI SKU-matching that understands UPC/GTIN/ASIN/MPN, variants,
      bundles/multi-packs, preorders, and policy exceptions to reduce false
      positives.
    - >-
      Evidence-grade capture: timestamped screenshots (UTC-synced), price
      breakdown (item, shipping, taxes), coupon code detection, buy box status,
      and cryptographic hash for tamper-evidence.
    - >-
      Automated notices: templated emails/portal submissions (Brand Registry,
      eBay VeRO, Walmart Brand Portal), reseller identification, throttling, and
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Escalation workflows: reminders, second/third notices, C&D templates via
      partner counsel, and retailer escalation playbooks; SLA tracking for
      responses.
    - >-
      Authorized reseller management: import/maintain authorized lists, detect
      mismatches, and flag suspected gray-market sources.
    - >-
      Dashboards and reporting: margin-at-risk, time-to-compliance, violation
      heat maps, repeat offender leaderboard, and ROI summary.
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP/PIM (e.g., NetSuite, Acumatica, SkuVault), CRM
      (HubSpot/Salesforce), Slack/MS Teams alerts, and SSO (Okta/Azure AD).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native MAP monitoring and enforcement built for toy & hobby complexity
    (bundles, preorders, MAP holidays). Detects violations within 30 minutes,
    captures evidence-grade records, and automates notices and
    escalations—restoring compliant pricing and dealer trust with measurable ROI
    in 30–60 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specialized SKU/bundle matching and a curated seller identity graph
    for toy & hobby that dramatically reduces false positives and accelerates
    enforcement, combined with an evidence chain-of-custody pipeline
    marketplaces accept—driving faster, repeatable compliance outcomes
    competitors struggle to match.
