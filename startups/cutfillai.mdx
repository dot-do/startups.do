  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 8–20 hours per bid manually extracting quantities and
      scope from 100–600 page civil plan sets and specs, limiting bids submitted
      per month and delaying responses to GCs.
    - >-
      Manual takeoffs for earthwork (contours, TINs, strip/spoil, shrink/swell,
      haul) and sitework items (utilities, curb/gutter, paving, erosion control)
      are error-prone; 1–3 missed scope items per bid is common, eroding margin
      by 2–5%.
    - >-
      Plan revisions force near-complete rework; version diffing is manual and
      risky, leading to change-order disputes and absorbed costs.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced estimators increases backlog; firms cannot staff
      up quickly during peak seasons, hurting hit rates and revenue.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (Bluebeam, AGTEK/Trimble, HCSS HeavyBid, spreadsheets)
      require double-entry and lose context; no system-of-record for
      assumptions, factors, or spec-driven obligations.
    - >-
      GCs/Owners are demanding faster turnarounds and clearer scope breakdowns;
      poor scope clarity increases RFI churn and bid exclusions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or ingest plan sets/specs (PDF, TIFF, DWG) from
      Procore/Autodesk/Box; auto-classify sheets, parse legends, scales, match
      plan/profile/cross-sections.
    - >-
      Earthwork engine builds a 3D TIN from existing/proposed contours, spot
      elevations, sections; computes cut/fill by phase, topsoil strip/respread,
      shrink/swell, over-excavation, and haul distances with selectable methods
      (average end area, grid, TIN).
    - >-
      Automated takeoff for key sitework items: demolition/clearing, erosion
      control, excavation/backfill, utilities (sanitary, storm, water with
      trench volumes and bedding), curb/gutter, sidewalks, asphalt/concrete
      areas and tonnage, signage/striping, fencing.
    - >-
      Spec and notes miner extracts CSI 31–33 requirements, alternates, testing,
      temporary works, permits, and constraints to build a scope checklist and
      bid item list; links each item to sheet/spec citations.
    - >-
      Revision and delta detection highlights changes in contours, utilities,
      details, addenda; regenerates affected quantities; maintains an audit
      trail of what changed.
    - >-
      Risk and scope gap flags: missing details, mismatched plan/spec,
      conflicting elevations, unusual shrink/swell assumptions, utility
      crossings; confidence scoring per quantity.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: optional estimator review workflow with side-by-side
      plan evidence; one-click corrections train the model for that customer.
    - >-
      Exports: CSV, Excel, HCSS HeavyBid items, AGTEK/Trimble surfaces, Autodesk
      Takeoff, Procore budget lines; include assumption sheets and RFI draft
      list.
    - >-
      Project templates with company factors (crew productivity, waste,
      shrink/swell defaults) and local material densities; scenario comparisons
      for alternates/phasing.
    - >-
      API for partners and enterprise integrations; SSO, SOC 2-ready data
      handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From plan set to bid-ready earthwork volumes and sitework scope in hours,
    not days—AI that understands civil drawings and specs, flags scope gaps,
    tracks revisions, and exports directly to HeavyBid/AGTEK/Autodesk. Reduce
    takeoff time by 60–80% and missed-scope risk by 50%+ while documenting every
    assumption.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, proprietary dataset of annotated civil/site plan
    sets and spec-to-scope mappings combined with physics-informed terrain
    modeling and customer-specific calibration (shrink/swell, densities). Tight
    integrations with HeavyBid/AGTEK and human-in-the-loop QA create a learning
    loop competitors without domain data or estimator workflows cannot
    replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Site preparation contractors (estimators and PMs) who need fast, accurate
    quantities and clear scopes from civil plans to bid more work with
    confidence.
  problem: >-
    External: Dense plan sets, manual takeoffs, and scattered specs cause slow
    bids and missed scope. Internal: Stress on bid day, fear of errors, not
    enough time or staff. Philosophical: Accurate quantities and clear scopes
    should be instant and accessible to every estimator.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve felt the pressure of tight deadlines and risky assumptions.
    Authority: Built by civil engineers and former estimators; trained on
    thousands of site-prep plan sets; proven accuracy with human-in-the-loop QA
    and secure workflows.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan: 1) Upload plans and specs, 2) AI extracts quantities and scope
    items, 3) Review, adjust, and export to your estimating tools. Agreement
    Plan: Transparent pricing, NDA + data security, support and onboarding
    included.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free trial or book a live demo. Transitional: Download a
    sample deliverable and ROI checklist.
  success: >-
    Faster, defensible bids; standardized scopes; fewer surprises; protected
    margins; more wins with the same team; estimators focused on strategy
    instead of tracing lines.
  failure: >-
    Missed items, blown margins, late proposals, burnout, rework and disputes,
    and losing to competitors who bid faster with better visibility.
