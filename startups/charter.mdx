  title: Charter Quote & Feasibility Agent
  description: >-
    Parses RFQs, checks airport/airspace feasibility, estimates costs, and
    returns a ready-to-send quote with itinerary and assumptions.
  targetUsers:
    - Air charter operators
    - Cargo charter providers
    - Helicopter charter/scenic ops

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual quote turnaround: Typical RFQ-to-quote time is 20–45 minutes
      per request, often spanning multiple systems (email, Avinode/Schedaero,
      EFBs, airport directories). Delays materially reduce win rate.
    - >-
      Feasibility risk and rework: Runway, performance, NOTAM/TFR,
      slots/curfews, customs/CIQ, duty-time and MEL checks are fragmented and
      error-prone, causing last-minute trip cancellations or costly re-routes.
    - >-
      Margin leakage: Fuel burn, winds, nav/route charges, FBO/handling,
      overnights, deicing, and tax rules (e.g., U.S. FET/segment fees, EU
      charges) are inconsistently modeled; quotes frequently underprice by
      3–10%.
    - >-
      Scaling constraints: Growing RFQ volume requires headcount; smaller
      operators cannot quote 24/7; brokers expect sub-15-minute responses.
    - >-
      Lack of auditability: Assumptions (e.g., alternates, minimum turn times,
      crew swaps) are not standardized, making QA, training, and regulatory
      audits harder.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ ingestion: Parse emails, PDFs, Avinode/Schedaero messages to
      extract itinerary, pax counts, dates, time windows, luggage, preferences,
      special handling.
    - >-
      Feasibility engine: Validate airports/runways, performance by type/tail,
      NOTAM/TFR, curfews/slots, customs/immigration, alternates, fuel
      availability, duty/rest legality, MEL restrictions, ETOPS eligibility
      where applicable.
    - >-
      Cost engine: Winds-aware block times, fuel burn, route/nav charges,
      airport/handling/overnight/deicing fees, catering/ground transport, crew
      costs, tax/regulatory fees; operator-specific markups and client-specific
      pricing rules.
    - >-
      Quote composer: Auto-generate ready-to-send email/PDF with itinerary,
      inclusions/exclusions, assumptions, and validity; supports multi-leg,
      multi-day, and repositioning logic.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: One-click review/approve/edit; transparent assumptions
      and sensitivity sliders (fuel price, winds, handling vendor).
    - >-
      Learning loop: Improves with outcomes (won/lost, actual vs estimated
      costs, client feedback) to tune pricing and feasibility heuristics per
      operator and per tail.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Send feasibility-checked, margin-accurate charter quotes in under 5
    minutes—directly from your inbox—without switching systems. Reduce quote
    time by 80–90%, increase win rates by 10–20%, and cut infeasible accepts to
    near zero, with clear, audit-ready assumptions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Operator- and tail-specific calibration across feasibility and cost, built
    from proprietary outcomes data (quotes won/lost, actuals vs estimates) and
    integrated regulatory knowledge graphs. Embedded in the inbox and existing
    ops stack—no system migration—creating high switching costs and continuous
    learning unique to each operator.

  character: >-
    Charter sales reps, brokers, and dispatchers at on-demand operators (NAICS
    481219) who must turn RFQs into accurate quotes fast.
  problem: >-
    RFQs flood in; manual feasibility checks across airports, NOTAMs, crew duty,
    and costs are slow and error‑prone—causing missed buying windows, re‑quotes,
    and margin hits. It shouldn’t take a war room to send a reliable charter
    quote.
  guide: >-
    Aviation‑trained AI, backed by ops experts and live data (NOTAMs, METAR/TAF,
    fees, fuel), purpose‑built for 481219. We’ve priced thousands of trips and
    know what derails a quote.
  plan: >-
    1) Forward an RFQ or connect your inbox/CRM. 2) The agent parses legs,
    checks airport/airspace/crew feasibility, and builds costs plus itinerary
    with assumptions and validity. 3) You review, set margins, and send the
    ready‑to‑go quote. Agreement: transparent line items, auditable sources, and
    enterprise‑grade security.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 14‑day trial or forward your next RFQ to your unique agent address
    to get a live quote in minutes. Transitional: book a 20‑minute demo or
    download a sample quote + ROI model.
  success: >-
    Sub‑15‑minute turnaround, higher win rates, fewer re‑quotes, protected
    margins, and confident ops—quoting that scales 24/7 without added headcount.
  failure: >-
    Slow or inaccurate quoting leads to lost deals, fee surprises and reposition
    costs, crew duty busts, compliance risk, and damaged client trust.
