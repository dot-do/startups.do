  problem:
    - >-
      High-speed decorators (1,200–2,400 cans per minute) make it impractical
      for human inspectors to consistently detect subtle print/varnish defects
      in real time, causing scrap and unplanned downtime.
    - >-
      Common defects (mottling, registration drift, voids, streaks, varnish
      skips) are detected too late (often at palletization or customer audit),
      increasing rework and risk of chargebacks.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge dependent; mean time to
      root cause often exceeds one shift, prolonging instability and waste.
    - >-
      Data from decorators, ink kitchens, ovens, and vision stations is siloed,
      limiting statistical process control (SPC) and continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Labor shortages and turnover reduce inspection expertise and consistency,
      especially across night/weekend shifts.
    - >-
      Existing general-purpose vision systems require extensive manual tuning;
      sensitivity either misses low-contrast defects or generates excessive
      false rejects.
  solution:
    - >-
      Inline, high-speed vision at the decorator exit and/or post-oven with
      line-scan/area cameras synchronized to can pitch; edge inference
      delivering <150 ms latency.
    - >-
      AI models trained on can-specific defect modes (mottling, misregistration
      by color, voids, streaks, orange peel, blush, ghosting, varnish skips,
      pickoff) with per-class confidence and severity scoring.
    - >-
      Root-cause suggestion engine linking patterns to likely causes (e.g., ink
      viscosity drift, blanket wear, plate cylinder misalignment, nozzle
      clogging, oven temperature zones), with recommended checks and standard
      work.
    - >-
      Trend SPC dashboards (Cp/Cpk, control charts, DeltaE drift, defect ppm)
      with alerts to Teams/Email/SMS and automatic event logging in MES/
      historian.
    - >-
      Recipe/changeover verification: compare to golden images, set sensitivity
      thresholds by SKU/artwork, and guardrails for first-article approval.
    - >-
      APIs and drivers for decorator PLCs, ejector/marker control, MES
      (Ignition, FactoryTalk), historians (PI), and quality systems
      (InfinityQS).
    - >-
      Optional closed-loop hooks: nudge recommendations (e.g., ink
      temp/viscosity, registration correction) for operator approval; maintains
      audit trail.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, high-speed AI inspection that not only flags and quantifies
    print/varnish defects in real time, but also suggests the most likely root
    causes and corrective actions — reducing scrap 10–30%, lowering false
    rejects, and cutting time-to-stability after changeovers by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A can-decoration-specific defect and root-cause dataset built via OEM
    partnerships and multi-plant pilots, combined with physics-informed,
    high-speed models tuned for decorator dynamics — enabling reliable detection
    at 2,000+ cpm with actionable root-cause suggestions that general-purpose
    vision vendors struggle to deliver.

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual inspection is subjective and misses intermittent print/varnish
      defects.
    - 'Late detection drives scrap, rework, and downtime.'
    - Root-cause hunts slow changeovers and reduce OEE.
    - Inconsistent defect tagging across shifts and plants.

      decorator.
    - 'Quantifies severity by area, density, and location per can/lot/shift.'
