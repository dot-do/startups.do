  problem:
    - >-
      Manual scouting for pins and maturity is labor-intensive (4–12 labor hours
      per 1,000 m² per week), inconsistent across scouts, and error-prone.
    - >-
      Missed or late harvest windows reduce quality, shelf-life, and price
      realization (commonly 3–8% of flush volume affected).
    - >-
      Inaccurate maturity timing forces reactive labor scheduling and overtime,
      increasing costs by 5–15% during flush peaks.
    - >-
      Lack of reliable short-term yield forecasts impairs logistics with buyers,
      packaging prep, and cold-chain planning.
    - >-
      Existing cameras and sensors are underutilized for actionable decisions;
      most data is not translated into harvest readiness alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision models detect/classify pins vs. marketable fruits across
      species/tray types, with per-area density heatmaps.
    - >-
      Growth-curve inference estimates time-to-maturity at bed/block/tray level,
      updated every capture cycle (e.g., every 4–6 hours).
    - >-
      Harvest readiness alerts with lead times (e.g., 12–24 hours) delivered to
      WhatsApp/SMS/app to inform picker scheduling by room/row.
    - >-
      Yield forecasting dashboard: 24–96 hour forecast, flush-level projections,
      confidence intervals, and SKU mix (cap/whole/sliced where applicable).
    - >-
      Labor planning module: suggested picker-hours by room/zone per shift;
      integrates with rosters.
    - >-
      Edge or cloud inference with privacy controls; integrates with existing IP
      cameras or optional low-cost hardware kits.
    - >-
      APIs/webhooks to farm management systems for tasks and batch records;
      export to CSV/ERP.
    - >-
      Onboarding playbook: 2–4 week pilot with baseline measurement, model
      calibration, and ROI report.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Camera-agnostic AI that counts pins/fruits, predicts time-to-maturity per
    bed/block, and triggers precise harvest alerts—cutting scouting hours by
    50–70%, reducing missed harvest windows by 20–40%, and improving 72-hour
    yield forecast accuracy to within 10–15%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mushroom-specific, cycle-aware vision and maturity models trained on diverse
    substrates, species, and room geometries; hardware-agnostic deployment; and
    closed-loop learning using picker feedback and harvest outcomes—creating a
    data moat and faster, more accurate maturity ETAs than generic CV or manual
    methods.
