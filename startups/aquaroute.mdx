leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High miles per stop due to manual routing and limited multi-depot
      optimization (typical baseline: 1.2–1.6 miles per case-stop vs 0.9–1.1
      achievable)
    - >-
      Time-window compliance issues (retailer/DC appointments) causing
      chargebacks and lost preferred vendor scores (chargebacks often $150–$500
      per late/early delivery, detention $50–$100 per hour)
    - >-
      Suboptimal trailer utilization (cube and weight) resulting in extra runs;
      frequent breaches of axle/weight limits for water loads (risk of DOT
      fines)
    - >-
      Planning takes multiple hours daily across planners, limiting scenario
      analysis for spikes (heat waves, promos)
    - >-
      Lack of integrated load building with routing leads to infeasible plans at
      the dock (rework/delay)
    - >-
      Poor visibility and dynamic re-optimization when orders change or
      traffic/ELD constraints shift mid-day
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/TMS/WMS/ELD causes stale constraints (time
      windows, dock capacities, live appointment slots) and inaccurate ETAs
  solution:
    - >-
      End-to-end optimizer that jointly solves multi-depot VRP with time windows
      (VRPTW), driver HOS, and 3D load/weight/axle constraints for 53’ dry vans
      and pups
    - >-
      Retailer compliance engine encoding appointment rules, ASN cutoffs, and
      chargeback policies; risk scoring and automatic sequencing to minimize
      penalties
    - >-
      Dynamic re-optimization using live traffic and ELD/telematics to adjust
      routes and ETAs; dispatcher approval workflow
    - >-
      Automated appointment scheduling/integration (e.g., Opendock) with soft
      and hard window handling
    - >-
      What-if simulator for promos, heat spikes, and plant downtime; scenario
      comparisons with savings estimates
    - >-
      Data integrations: ERP/OMS (orders), WMS (inventory/pallets), TMS
      (tenders), ELD/telematics (HOS/geo), mapping (ETAs), EDI (retailer
      portals)
    - >-
      Planner cockpit (web) + driver app/driver API for stop sequence, notes,
      and POD; multilingual support
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 8-week proof-of-value (baseline capture, A/B day
      routing, weekly ops reviews, savings audit)
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven daily routing + 3D trailer load building built specifically for
    bottled water. Reduce truck miles 8–15%, cut chargebacks 20–40%, lift OTIF
    by 3–6 pts, and boost trailer utilization to 90%+ cube/weight—all in under
    10 minutes of planning per depot.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific constraints library for bottled water (heavy loads, axle
    limits, common pallet configs, club-store/DC appointment patterns) + a
    compliance rules engine tuned to major retailers’ chargeback policies.
    Trained on seasonal water demand spikes and promo behaviors, enabling more
    accurate ETAs, dwell forecasts, and penalty avoidance than generalist
    routing tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and distribution leaders at bottled water manufacturers who must
    hit tight delivery windows, maximize trailer utilization, and protect
    margins.
  problem: >-
    External — Volatile orders, strict customer time windows, limited
    drivers/trailers, and complex load sequencing create excess miles, misloads,
    and chargebacks.

    Internal — Planners are stuck in spreadsheets late at night, worried about
    penalties, rework, and unhappy customers.

    Philosophical — Delivering clean water shouldn’t waste fuel, time, or
    goodwill; efficient, on-time service should be standard.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of daily cutoffs, retailer SLAs, and chargebacks.
    Our team blends beverage distribution know‑how with an AI optimization
    engine built for multi-stop routes and trailer loading. Secure, integrable
    with ERP/TMS/WMS, and supported by experts who stay with you from pilot to
    scale.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect orders, customers, depots, assets, and constraints (time windows,
    HOS, trailer capacity, loading rules).

    2) Run the AI agent daily to propose optimized routes, stop sequences, and
    pallet-by-pallet load plans.

    3) Dispatch to drivers, monitor execution, and auto-adjust for late orders
    or changes.

    Agreement plan:

    - Low-risk pilot, clear pricing, no long-term lock-in.

    - Data security and SLA-backed support.

    - Success criteria defined up front.
  callToAction: |-
    Direct: Book a route and load audit or start a pilot.
    Transitional: Get the ROI checklist and a sample load-plan/route report.
  success: >-
    Fewer miles and fuel spend; higher on-time performance; fewer chargebacks;
    maximized trailer utilization with accurate load maps; faster planning
    (minutes, not hours); happier drivers and customers; predictable days and
    healthier margins.
  failure: >-
    Avoid late deliveries, penalties, empty miles, overtime, misloads, retailer
    deductions, and eroded margins that damage customer relationships and
    growth.
