leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual hazmat checks are slow and error-prone: dispatchers and drivers
      spend 8–20 minutes per load validating shipping descriptions, segregation,
      and placards.
    - >-
      Regulatory complexity is high: 49 CFR 172/173/177 rules, the segregation
      table (177.848), and placard thresholds change; small mistakes lead to
      costly violations.
    - >-
      Mixed and multi-stop local routes create dynamic placarding/segregation
      issues that spreadsheets and static checklists don’t handle well.
    - >-
      Roadside inspection risk: HM BASIC and Out-of-Service violations (e.g.,
      wrong/missing placards, missing emergency response info) drive insurance
      costs and lost time.
    - >-
      SDS/BOL formats vary (PDF, photos, EDI); staff turnover leads to
      inconsistent quality and re-training costs.
    - >-
      Existing tools require manual data entry; they don’t parse BOL/SDS or
      generate auditable evidence for inspectors.
    - >-
      Carriers lack a system of record to prove due diligence during audits,
      incident investigations, or customer scorecard reviews.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest BOL/SDS via upload, email-in, camera, or API; OCR/parse line items
      to extract UN/NA, proper shipping name, hazard classes, subsidiary risks,
      packing group, quantities, and packaging types.
    - >-
      Validate 49 CFR-required shipping paper elements (172.202–.203), emergency
      response info (172.600–.604), and special provisions; flag omissions and
      suggest corrections.
    - >-
      Run automated segregation checks using 177.848 (including subsidiary
      risks) and incompatibility rules; highlight violations by stop/position.
    - >-
      Placard planner computes required placards (172 Subpart F) considering
      bulk vs. non-bulk, Table 1/2, aggregate quantities, limited/small quantity
      exceptions, and multi-stop changes.
    - >-
      Generate an “Inspector Pack”: printable/emailable summary with citations,
      placard list, ERG references, and emergency phone verification for
      roadside inspections.
    - >-
      Multi-stop optimizer: simulate stop order changes and on-truck mixing to
      maintain compliance while minimizing placard swaps.
    - >-
      Audit trail + versioning: store parsed docs, validation results, CFR
      version used, user actions, and timestamps for defensibility.
    - >-
      Integrations: TMS/ELD connectors to pull loads and push validation
      results/placard instructions to dispatch and driver apps.
    - >-
      Continuous rules updates with change logs when PHMSA/DOT updates HMR;
      optional state/local routing restrictions advisories for tunnels/bridges.
    - >-
      Admin analytics: violations by lane/customer/terminal; coaching insights
      and training needs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, auditable hazmat validation from BOL/SDS to road-ready: reduce
    placarding/segregation errors and inspection risk by 30%+ while cutting
    dispatch validation time to under 1 minute per load.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from real inspections and shipper-specific documents
    builds a unique, validated dataset tied to outcomes. Combined with a
    CFR-versioned rules engine and multi-stop logic, this produces higher
    accuracy and defensible audit trails competitors relying on manual entry or
    generic OCR can’t match.
  customerSegments:
