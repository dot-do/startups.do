  problem:
    - >-
      Manual and siloed onboarding workflows lead to 3–10 day account opening
      cycles for many savings banks and credit unions, causing 20–60%
      application drop-off and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Compliance teams struggle to keep Customer Identification Program (CIP),
      beneficial ownership (BO), and recordkeeping consistent across products
      and geographies; audit exceptions and remediation costs are high.
    - >-
      Fraud and identity risk are rising (synthetic IDs, mule accounts,
      deepfakes); point-solution tools don’t coordinate well, creating gaps and
      redundant spend.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in and static rules limit optimization; institutions overpay
      for checks with high false positive rates and no adaptive routing or
      backtesting.
    - >-
      Existing RegTech is skewed to fintechs or global banks; mid-market
      depositories lack out-of-the-box policy-as-code mapped to FFIEC/BSA/KYC
      requirements and audit-grade evidencing.
    - >-
      Legacy cores/LOS integrations are costly and slow; change management and
      testing block rapid iteration on risk policies.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI agent-led intake that guides applicants, validates data in real time,
      and orchestrates identity/KYB checks based on risk tier and product type.
    - >-
      Dynamic vendor routing across best-of-breed providers (e.g., document,
      biometric, bureau, watchlist, business registry) to minimize cost per
      approval while maintaining risk thresholds.
    - >-
      Policy-as-code mapped to FFIEC/BSA/FinCEN guidance with version control,
      approvals, segregation of duties, and change logs for audit readiness.
    - >-
      Explainable decisioning: trace every decision to data sources, rules,
      models, and human overrides; provide regulator-friendly narratives and
      evidence bundles.
    - >-
      End-to-end CIP recordkeeping: WORM storage, five-year retention policies,
      immutable audit trails, and complete application replay.
    - >-
      Case management for manual review, adverse media triage, beneficial
      ownership resolution, and exception handling; continuous feedback loop to
      the risk model.
    - >-
      Low-code integrations with core banking, LOS, and CRM (e.g., Fiserv, FIS,
      Jack Henry, Temenos, Mambu, MeridianLink, nCino, Salesforce FSC) plus
      web/mobile SDKs.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and backtesting: champion–challenger vendor routing,
      false-positive reduction analytics, and ROI dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce onboarding time from days to minutes with an AI-driven,
    vendor-agnostic orchestration layer purpose-built for depository CIP/KYB,
    delivering explainable risk decisions and tamper-evident recordkeeping that
    regulators can audit.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Auditor-ready policy-as-code and evidencing tailored to depository CIP/KYB
    with dynamic, explainable vendor orchestration—combining best-of-breed data
    sources, regulator-aligned documentation, and optimization tooling that most
    single-vendor KYC providers and fintech-first platforms lack.
