  problem:
    - >-
      Day-of-move ETAs are unreliable; 15–30% of residential moves and 20–35% of
      office moves miss their scheduled arrival windows due to traffic, loading
      delays, or building access constraints.
    - >-
      Dispatchers spend 20–40% of day-of-move time on WISMO (Where Is My Order?)
      calls, leading to overtime, crew idle time, and poor customer experience.
    - >-
      Building logistics (elevators, loading docks, COI requirements,
      time-window restrictions) are poorly communicated or discovered late,
      causing fines ($200–$1,000), re-bookings, or partial moves.
    - >-
      Telematics and TMS data are fragmented; GPS pings exist, but there’s no
      moving-specific ETA model or automated notification/triage tied to jobs,
      crews, and buildings.
    - >-
      Exception handling is manual and reactive; delays, access issues, and crew
      constraints are escalated late, increasing churn, claims, and negative
      reviews.
  solution:
    - >-
      Moving-specific ETA engine combining telematics, TMS job data,
      traffic/weather, historic dwell times, and building-time windows to output
      ETAs with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Automated, branded notifications (SMS/email/voice) to customers, building
      managers, and crews with live ETA link, prep checklists, and two-way chat.
    - >-
      Exception triage workflows: rules detect delays/access risks; route to
      coordinator with SLA timers, call-tree, and one-click remediation (reslot
      elevator, adjust crew, alert customer).
    - >-
      Pre-arrival readiness checks: auto-collect COI, elevator reservations,
      loading dock photos, and building rules via mobile web forms; flag gaps
      24–48 hours pre-move and on day-of.
    - >-
      Integrations: plug-ins for leading TMS, telematics (GPS), calendar, and
      ticketing systems; webhook/API for custom triggers and dashboards.
    - >-
      Analytics & ROI: dashboards for ETA accuracy, WISMO call reduction,
      overtime saved, on-time performance, building violation incidents, and
      CSAT/NPS uplift.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Proactive, moving-specific ETA predictions with automated notifications and
    exception triage that cut WISMO calls by 40–60%, reduce overtime by 10–15%,
    and improve on-time arrival by 10–20 points—without adding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary building access and dwell-time knowledge graph fused
    with moving-specific ETA models and exception outcomes. As volume scales
    across geographies and buildings, predictions improve and triage playbooks
    become uniquely effective—creating defensible network effects and switching
    costs for movers and van lines.

  character: >-
    Dispatch and operations leaders at used household and office goods movers
    who want predictable day-of-move communication and fewer fire drills.
  problem: >-
    - External: Uncertain ETAs, traffic and access constraints (docks,
    elevators, permits), last‑minute changes.

    - Internal: Stressed crews and overwhelmed dispatchers fielding endless
    “Where are you?” calls.

    - Philosophical: On moving day, people deserve clarity—not surprises.
  guide: >-
    We get the chaos of move day and the reputational risk when timelines slip.
    Our team blends moving operations and logistics AI expertise, with proven
    integrations into common TMS/telematics and playbooks tailored to HHG/office
    moves.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan: 1) Connect your TMS/telematics and crews, 2) Set notification
    and escalation rules by customer/building, 3) Go live with predictive ETAs
    and exception triage, 4) Monitor, refine, and scale to all crews. Agreement
    Plan: Clear SLAs, data privacy by design, customer opt‑outs, and a
    no‑lock‑in pilot.

    Direct: Schedule a 15‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot on 1–3 crews.
    Transitional: Get the Day‑of‑Move ETA & Exception Playbook and ROI
    checklist.
  success: |-
    - Proactive, accurate ETAs to shippers, consignees, and buildings.
    - Fewer incoming calls and fire drills; smoother dock/elevator coordination.
    - Faster exception resolution with human-in-the-loop escalations.
    - Higher CSAT/NPS, on‑time performance, and crew productivity.
    - Brand trust through reliable, transparent communication.
  failure: |-
    - Missed time windows, building fines, and access denials.
    - Angry customers, bad reviews, and lost referrals.
    - Wasted crew hours, overtime, and costly re-dispatches.
