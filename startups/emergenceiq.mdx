  problem:
    - >-
      Manual stand counts are slow (20–40 minutes/field), sample tiny areas, and
      introduce high variance, leading to poor replant decisions.
    - >-
      Growers and agronomists lack timely, spatially complete emergence maps
      (V1–V4) to quantify skips, gaps, and within-row variability.
    - >-
      Existing drone analytics often require expert workflows, long turnaround
      times (>24 hours), or expensive service fees, missing the short decision
      window.
    - >-
      Inconsistent thresholds for replant decisions across hybrids, planting
      dates, soil temps, and insurance guidelines cause either unnecessary
      replanting or missed opportunities.
    - >-
      Limited integration with farm data platforms (e.g., John Deere Operations
      Center, Climate FieldView) fragments workflow and reduces adoption.
    - >-
      Connectivity constraints in the field make cloud-only solutions unreliable
      during peak season.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision models detect and count emerged corn plants from drone or
      guided phone imagery at V1–V4.
    - >-
      Emergence heatmaps (per 10–20 ft segments) quantify skips, doubles, and
      gaps; gap-length statistics flag yield-risk zones.
    - >-
      Replant decision support: agronomy-tuned thresholds (e.g., % of target
      stand, gap length distribution, planting date, GDU accumulation) with
      editable rulesets aligned to local practice and insurance guidelines.
    - >-
      Guided capture app: flight plans for DJI-class drones; phone mode with
      AR-guided transects ensuring adequate coverage and angle/altitude
      consistency.
    - >-
      Results in-field: offline/edge pre-processing on device; full results in
      <30 minutes for a 160-acre block when connectivity is available;
      PDF/GeoTIFF/Shapefile exports.
    - >-
      Integrations: John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView,
      AgLeader/Trimble shapefiles; APIs for retailers to embed reports into
      portals.
    - >-
      Quality assurance: confidence scores per tile, automatic blur/residue
      detection, and redo prompts; side-by-side with manual transects for
      auditability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Fast, accurate, field-ready AI that turns drone or phone images into stand
    counts and emergence heatmaps within minutes, integrated into existing farm

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Corn growers and farm managers who want fast, objective stand counts and
    emergence insight within days of planting to protect yield and avoid
    unnecessary replant.
  problem: >-
    Manual stand counts are slow, patchy, and subjective; emergence is uneven;
    the replant window is tight. Without field‑wide, objective data, growers
    feel uncertain and risk over‑ or under‑reacting—costing time, money, and
    yield.
  guide: >-
    We understand early‑season pressure. Our agronomy‑informed AI turns drone or
    phone imagery into trustworthy stand counts and emergence heatmaps, built
    with agronomist‑reviewed datasets and compatible with common DJI drones and
    smartphones.
  plan: >-
    1) Capture: Fly a quick grid with a standard drone or walk rows with our
    phone app at VE–V3. 2) Analyze: Upload imagery; AI counts plants, flags
    gaps, and maps emergence variability. 3) Act: Use thresholded replant zones,
    share reports, and export shapefiles/geoPDF to equipment and advisors.
  callToAction: Schedule a 15‑minute demo or start a one‑field trial before V3.
  success: >-
    Make confident, timely replant decisions; target interventions where ROI is
    highest; save scouting time; improve uniformity and yield potential; keep
    auditable records for advisors and future seasons.
  failure: >-
    Without it: hidden stand loss goes unnoticed, replant decisions are guessed
    or delayed, inputs are misallocated, and preventable yield is lost at
    harvest.

  problem:
    - Manual stand counts are slow and cover tiny areas.
    - Replant windows are short and risky to guess.
    - Uneven emergence and skips are hard to see early.
    - Labor is scarce during planting and early scouting.
    - Inconsistent methods produce inconsistent decisions.
    - No geo-referenced maps to drive variable-rate replant.
  solution:
    - Automated plant counting from RGB drone or phone imagery.
    - Emergence heatmaps reveal weak zones and skips by row.
    - 'Field, zone, and row-level summaries with confidence indicators.'
    - Replant ROI guidance using target population and yield assumptions.
    - 'Export shapefile, GeoJSON, and CSV for prescriptions.'
    - Works with common drones and standard smartphone cameras.
  features:
    - Corn-specific AI tuned for VE to V3 stages.
    - Row detection and orientation auto-calibration.
    - Counts normalized per row-foot and per acre.
    - Adjustable thresholds for viable plants and gap size.
    - Side-by-side maps for before/after and hybrid trials.
    - Multi-field dashboard with trend reports across farms.
    - Fast cloud processing and offline upload from the field.
    - 'QC overlays: missed rows, double plants, and low-confidence areas.'
    - Role-based access and data ownership controls.
    - API access for FMIS and analytics workflows.
  steps:
    - Capture imagery at VE-V3 with a drone or smartphone.
    - Upload images; AI detects rows and counts plants automatically.
    - Review emergence heatmap and population summaries.
    - Simulate replant scenarios and view ROI guidance.
    - Export zones to your planter or share with your agronomist.
