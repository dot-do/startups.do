  problem:
    - >-
      Turning takeoffs into polished, optioned, and compliant proposals
      currently takes 60–120 minutes per job and is error-prone (missed line
      items, margin leakage).
    - >-
      Proposals are inconsistent and often unbranded, reducing close rates and
      upsell attachment (no Good/Better/Best).
    - >-
      E‑signature and deposit collection are separate tools/steps (DocuSign +
      payment link), creating friction and slower cycle times.
    - >-
      State- and province-specific terms, lien notices, and warranty language
      are hard to maintain; compliance risk is high for non-legal teams.
    - >-
      Sales managers lack real-time visibility into proposal status, option
      selection, and rep performance; forecasting is guesswork.
    - >-
      Data re-entry between takeoff tools (HOVER/EagleView), CRM
      (JobNimbus/AccuLynx/BuilderPrime), and accounting (QuickBooks) wastes time
      and creates mismatches.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest takeoffs (HOVER/EagleView/ArcSite) and map measurements to
      standardized siding assemblies with vendor SKUs and waste factors.
    - >-
      AI pricing assistant builds Good/Better/Best packages (e.g., Vinyl → Fiber
      Cement → Premium) with accessories (soffit/fascia/gutters/insulation) and
      auto-calculated taxes/fees.
    - >-
      Brand-safe proposal templates with photos, color boards, and 3D renders;
      one-click e‑signature and deposit payment links embedded.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction-aware terms and notices (state/province lien laws,
      cancellation windows, warranty language) inserted automatically.
    - >-
      CRM/accounting sync (JobNimbus/AccuLynx/BuilderPrime/QuickBooks);
      one-click change orders preserving version history.
    - >-
      Analytics: open/engage tracking, option selection, signature turnaround,
      rep win rates, margin leakage alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From takeoff to branded, option-rich, e‑signed proposal in 15 minutes—boost
    close rates 10–20% and average order value 5–10% while ensuring
    state-compliant terms.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Siding-first AI that maps takeoffs to vendor-specific assemblies and
    compliant terms, backed by live manufacturer/distributor catalogs and
    jurisdictional legal libraries—reducing proposal prep to minutes while
    protecting margins and compliance in ways generic proposal/e‑sign tools
    cannot.
