  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly rotation plans are manual, error‑prone, and take 2–6 hours/week,
      leading to inconsistent paddock rest days and suboptimal residuals.
    - >-
      Pasture growth varies with weather; producers struggle to match biomass
      supply (kg DM/ha) to herd demand (kg DM/cow/day) for mixed milk + weight
      gain objectives.
    - >-
      Overgrazing below target residuals (e.g., <1,500–1,700 kg DM/ha) reduces
      regrowth rates and pasture persistence, increasing feed costs 5–20%.
    - >-
      Supplement use and costs (grain, TMR, hay) are not dynamically optimized
      against pasture growth forecasts, leading to 5–15% avoidable feed spend.
    - >-
      Data silos (milk meters, scales, plate meter, satellite, weather) hinder
      timely, integrated decision‑making and benchmarking.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into paddock‑level performance (utilization %, growth
      rates, rest intervals) prevents proactive adjustments, hurting milk solids
      per hectare and average daily gain (ADG).
    - >-
      Labor constraints and seasonal workload spikes make it hard to
      consistently monitor sward height/biomass and enforce back‑fencing/laneway
      moves.
    - >-
      Regulatory and sustainability reporting (grazing records, nutrient plans,
      carbon intensity) requires documentation most farms don’t have structured.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deliver weekly, paddock‑level rotation plans with sequence, entry/exit
      dates, allocation sizes, and target residuals (e.g., 1,600–1,800 kg
      DM/ha).
    - >-
      Integrate biomass estimates (satellite NDVI/SAR + plate meter) with 7–14
      day weather to forecast growth (kg DM/ha/day) and adjust rest days
      dynamically.
    - >-
      Model dual‑purpose demand by class (lactating cows, dry cows, heifers,
      finishers) including lactation stage, parity, BCS, and ADG targets to
      recommend supplement rates or buffer feeding when needed.
    - >-
      Provide a real‑time grazing wedge, utilization analytics, and alerts when
      paddocks are at risk of under/over‑grazing given forecasted growth and
      herd movements.
    - >-
      Offer economic optimization: minimize feed cost/kg milk or /kg gain under
      constraints (residual targets, animal performance, pasture persistence).
    - >-
      Enable mobile, offline field use to record actual residuals, moves, and
      plate‑meter readings; auto‑replans based on deviations.
    - >-
      Integrate with milk meters, in‑parlor software, EID scales, and virtual
      fencing to close the loop from plan to outcome.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI grazing planner that matches pasture growth to dual‑purpose herd
    demand and production goals, optimizing weekly rotations to hit target
    residuals, milk yield, and weight gain—reducing supplement costs and
    planning time while improving pasture persistence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Dual‑purpose‑specific modeling that ties biomass and rest‑day dynamics to
    simultaneous milk and weight‑gain outcomes, validated with multi‑region
    pilot data and closed‑loop integrations (milk meters, scales, and virtual

  character: >-
    Dual‑purpose cattle ranchers and mixed farmers who need to match pasture
    growth with herd demand—without overgrazing or missing milk/gain targets.
  problem: >-
    External: Growth varies weekly; herd demand shifts; paddock sizing, rest
    periods, and residuals are hard to get right.

    Internal: Guesswork causes decision fatigue and uncertainty.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between profitability, animal
    performance, and land stewardship.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve managed and modeled rotational grazing; we know the pressure
    of weather, markets, and animal welfare.

    Authority: AI forecasts growth and optimizes rotations across diverse herds;
    built with agronomy and animal science; field‑tested plans that hit
    residuals and milk/gain targets.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect pasture maps and herd data (stocking, milk/gain targets).

    2) Calibrate growth with local weather and simple sward checks.

    3) Receive weekly rotation: paddock order, area, rest days, and residuals
    matched to demand.

    4) Adjust in‑app; AI learns and refines each week.

    Agreement Plan: Clear metrics (covers, residuals, milk/ADG), your data stays
    yours, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30‑day pilot on your current paddocks.

    Transitional: Download a sample rotation and ROI worksheet; join a 20‑minute
    onboarding webinar.
  success: >-
    Consistent residuals, higher milk and ADG from grass, lower bought‑in feed,
    healthier soils, simpler weekly decisions, resilient pastures, and confident
    profitability.
  failure: >-
    Over/under‑grazing, suppressed milk and ADG, higher supplement costs,
    pasture decline, stressed managers, and missed profit.

      AI weekly rotations that match pasture growth to dual‑purpose herd
      demand—protect residuals and hit milk and gain targets.
    ctaText: Plan My Rotation
    ctaHref: /start
  problem:
    - Forage supply and herd demand rarely line up by hand.
    - 'Over/undergrazing cuts milk, growth, and pasture recovery.'
    - >-
      Dual‑purpose herds complicate moves across milkers, replacements, and
      finishers.
    - 'Spreadsheets, wedges, and plate‑meter notes don’t stay synced.'
    - Weather swings make residual management a guessing game.
    - 'Hidden costs: wasted supplement, lost rest days, and labor inefficiency.'
  solution:
    - AI forecasts growth and demand to schedule weekly rotations by paddock.
    - Maintains target residuals and pre‑graze covers to protect regrowth.
    - Optimizes milk yield and ADG with precise daily pasture allocations.
    - >-
      Auto‑adjusts for rain, heat, and quality; recommends buffer feed when
      needed.
    - >-
      One plan for milkers and beef groups—supports split herds and
      leader–follower.
    - Simple move sheets and real‑time alerts keep crews aligned.
  features:
    - Dynamic grazing wedge with pre/post‑graze targets.
    - 'Growth data from satellite, plate meter, and local rainfall.'
    - Milk meter and scale data to track response and ADG.

    - Feed budget and buffer feed recommendations by group.
    - Offline mobile logging; printable and shareable move sheets.
    - 'Integrations and imports: sensors, milk meters, scales, weather, CSV/API.'
    - Compliance-friendly records for audits and regen reporting.
  steps:
    - Map paddocks and set pre‑graze and residual targets.
    - 'Connect data: satellite/plate meter, rainfall, milk meters, and weights.'
    - 'Define herds, lactation stages, target milk/ADG, and supplements.'
    - 'Generate weekly rotation with move timing, areas, and allocations.'
    - 'Execute moves and log covers/residuals on mobile, even offline.'
