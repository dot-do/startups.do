  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone preflight leads to missed issues (bleed, overprint,
      spot/process conflicts, dieline mismatches) that surface on press.
    - >-
      Artwork cycles are slow: 2–5 days average from customer art receipt to
      approved proof, with 2–4 back-and-forth rounds.
    - >-
      Press- and substrate-specific constraints (flexo min line width, dot gain,
      TAC, white-ink layers on kraft/foil boards, composite-can seam no-print
      zones) are tribal knowledge and inconsistently applied.
    - >-
      Barcodes and regulatory marks fail final QC (low contrast, truncation,
      quiet zones), triggering rework, delays, or scrap.
    - >-
      Dieline/structural inconsistencies (glue flaps, tuck locks, crash-lock
      bottoms, tube/can seams, fold/score crack risk) are not validated against
      artwork layers.
    - >-
      High prepress labor costs (30–60 minutes/job) and shortage of experienced
      prepress operators limit throughput.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (RIP, CAD/dieline, MIS/ERP, proofing portals) create
      handoff friction and version control issues.
    - >-
      Quality drift: lack of closed-loop learning from press QC and customer
      returns means the same errors recur.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven preflight engine tuned for paperboard containers: parses PDF/AI
      files plus CAD dielines (CF2, DXF, DDES) to validate structure-art
      alignment.
    - >-
      Risk scoring and explainable annotations: flags each issue with location,
      severity, and fix rationale; auto-suggests or applies fixes with audit
      trail.
    - >-
      Plant-specific rule sets: press/substrate profiles (offset, flexo,
      digital), ink limits/TAC, min line widths, trapping/overprint rules,
      white-ink handling, varnish/foil separations, composite-can seam/glue flap
      no-print zones.
    - >-
      Barcode simulation and grading: checks contrast, quiet zones,
      magnification; predicts ISO/IEC 15416 grade by substrate/print method;
      suggests size/placement fixes.
    - >-
      3D proofing and fold/crack risk: generates fold simulations and highlights
      high-coverage at scores/hinges likely to crack; recommends coverage
      reductions or grain adjustments.
    - >-
      Automated deliverables: outputs corrected PDF/X-4 with ISO 19593-1
      processing steps/layers, step-and-repeat/imposition where applicable, and
      customer-facing annotated proofs (2D/3D).
    - >-
      Workflow integration: APIs and connectors for RIP/DFE (Harlequin, Esko,
      Hybrid), CAD (ArtiosCAD, EngView, Impact), MIS/ERP (EFI Radius, Microsoft
      Dynamics), and proof/approval portals.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingests press QC logs, barcode verifications, and
      customer return reasons to continuously refine risk models and rules.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: configurable approval gates for prepress to review
      auto-fixes and lock changes before release to production.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut artwork turnaround from days to hours with plant-aware AI that catches
    >95% of print risks pre-RIP, auto-fixes 50–70% of common issues, and
    generates press-ready, annotated proofs and corrected PDF/X-4 files aligned
    to your substrates, presses, and dielines.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A plant-aware risk engine trained on paperboard container failure modes
    (glue flaps, seams, fold cracks, partitions) and linked to CAD dielines and
    press QC outcomes, enabling explainable risk scoring and safe auto-fixes
    that general-purpose PDF tools lack. Closed-loop learning from real print
    feedback improves detection and reduces false positives over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Prepress leads, production planners, and quality managers at paperboard
    container manufacturers (NAICS 322219) who must turn customer artwork into
    print-ready carton files quickly and consistently.
  problem: >-
    Incoming artwork is inconsistent—bleed, dielines/creases, varnish/foil
    layers, overprint/trapping, barcode resolution, color separations—making
    manual preflight slow and error-prone, causing rework, press downtime,
    scrap, chargebacks, and missed ship dates.
  guide: >-
    Artwork Preflight & Proofing Assistant is a domain-trained AI built for
    paperboard packaging that automates checks, flags print risks, and generates
    annotated proofs or one-click fixes. It’s validated against packaging rules
    and integrates with Esko/Adobe workflows and your MIS/ERP.
  plan: >-
    - Connect your intake and select a spec profile (substrate, process, brand).

    - Upload or pull artwork; AI runs preflight and returns an annotated proof
    with a risk score.

    - Approve auto-fixes or request changes; export a press-ready package with
    an audit trail.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot: upload three recent jobs to receive
    free preflight reports and an ROI snapshot.
  success: >-
    Faster approvals (hours, not days), fewer errors and press stops,
    predictable makeready, higher OEE, on-time delivery, happier brand
    customers, and traceable sign-offs for ISO/GMP audits.
  failure: >-
    Without it, you keep firefighting hidden print risks—overprints, wrong
    dielines, barcode failures, color surprises—leading to scrap, rush overtime,
    chargebacks, and shrinking margins.
