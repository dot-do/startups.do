  problem:
    - >-
      Asset owners and geophysical consultants lack affordable, wide-area
      deformation monitoring that covers entire Areas of Interest (AOIs) at
      sub-centimeter sensitivity. Traditional ground sensors (GNSS/leveling)
      cost $3k–$10k per station and only sample points; many projects need
      wall-to-wall coverage.
    - >-
      Regulatory and ESG pressures (e.g., for tailings dams, land subsidence,
      and landslide risk) require auditable, frequent reporting
      (monthly/quarterly) that current manual surveys struggle to meet, causing
      schedule delays and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Existing InSAR services can be slow (weeks) and opaque, with inconsistent
      quality control and limited integration into clients’ GIS/CAD workflows,
      creating operational friction and adoption barriers.
    - >-
      Many AOIs are in mixed-coherence terrain (urban vs. vegetated). Users need
      reliable uncertainty quantification and confidence masks to avoid false
      alarms; current outputs often lack standardized error bars tied to GNSS
      benchmarks.
    - >-
      Budgets are constrained. Buyers need predictable, subscription-based
      pricing tied to AOI size and update frequency rather than bespoke, ad-hoc
      quotes that impede scaling.
    - >-
      Field safety and access constraints (e.g., unstable slopes, remote
      deserts) make frequent ground campaigns risky and expensive; remote
      sensing can reduce field days by 30–60%.
    - >-
      Decision-makers need timely alerts (within 24–72 hours of new
      acquisitions) to mitigate risk. Current latency from data acquisition to
      insight is often >1–2 weeks.
  solution:
    - >-
      SBAS time-series InSAR pipeline purpose-built for Sentinel-1
      (ascending/descending) to produce velocity (mm/year), cumulative
      displacement, and time-series per PS/DS point and raster outputs.
    - >-
      AI-assisted quality control: coherence prediction, phase-unwrapping QA,
      atmospheric artifact suppression selection (e.g., GACOS/ERA5) and anomaly
      detection for change events.
    - >-
      Operational SLAs: initial 3–5 year historical baseline for AOIs up to
      10,000 km² in 3–5 business days; routine updates delivered within 24–72
      hours of new acquisitions; optional weekly cadence using supplemental SAR.
    - >-
      Uncertainty quantification: per-pixel/point confidence masks, velocity
      standard error maps, and cross-validation against nearby GNSS stations
      (where available) with automated reporting of RMSE and coverage metrics.
    - >-
      GIS-first delivery: WMS/WMTS, tiled vector points (WebGL), GeoTIFFs,
      shapefiles/GeoPackage, and ArcGIS/GeoServer connectors; API and web
      dashboard for visualizations and alerts.
    - >-
      Alerting and thresholds: user-defined mm/month thresholds, trend-break
      detection, and corridor buffers (e.g., 100 m each side of pipeline) to
      reduce false positives and focus on assets.
    - >-
      Scalable architecture: cloud-native ingestion of SLC bursts, interferogram
      formation, SBAS estimation (e.g., ISCE2/MintPy-derived), catalog indexing,
      and incremental processing for rapid updates; optional augmentation with
      commercial SAR for gap-filling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, AOI-based SBAS InSAR monitoring from Sentinel-1 with mm/year
    trend accuracy, delivered as GIS-ready layers, APIs, and alerts within 24–72
    hours of acquisition—at a price point that scales from single sites to
    nationwide programs, with auditable uncertainty tied to GNSS benchmarks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-indexed Sentinel-1 burst archive with AOI-aware, incremental SBAS
    processing and AI-driven QA that cuts baseline delivery to days, plus a
    validated GNSS benchmark corpus enabling auditable uncertainty metrics
    competitors struggle to provide at scale.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Geophysical Surveying & Mapping leaders (NAICS 541360) who need SBAS
    time-series InSAR to monitor subsidence, uplift, and slope movement across
    AOIs, so they can de-risk projects, satisfy clients, and win bids.
  problem: >-
    External: Ground deformation is continuous but hard to see; sparse
    instruments and episodic surveys create blind spots. Internal: Teams worry
    they are missing mm-scale trends until it is too late. Philosophical: You
    should not have to guess where the ground is moving.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to deliver defensible deformation maps on tight
    budgets and timelines. Our AI InSAR service runs SBAS on Sentinel-1 to
    produce validated mm/yr rates and cumulative displacement,
    all-weather/day-night, with QA/QC, GIS/APIs, and historical backfill to 2015
    with 6-12 day updates.
  plan: >-
    1) Define AOIs, cadence, and outputs. 2) We process Sentinel-1 archives and
    new scenes with SBAS plus AI trend/anomaly detection. 3) You receive
    dashboards, map layers, alerts, and reports; start with a pilot, then scale
    under an SLA.
  callToAction: Book a demo; request a free sample AOI report; start a 30-day pilot.
  success: >-
    See and act on deformation early; reduce field visits; avoid surprises;
    defend decisions with auditable time-series; deliver on time and budget; win
    more and larger projects.
  failure: >-
    Missed warnings lead to asset damage, delays, overruns, safety incidents,
    and lost credibility with clients and regulators.
