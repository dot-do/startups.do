  problem:
    - >-
      Low online-to-booking conversion for rentals (typical 0.5–2.5% vs. 3–5%
      needed for sustainable CAC), especially outside store hours.
    - >-
      High labor cost and bottlenecks for fittings and consultations (30–60
      minutes per customer; phones and DMs consume staff time).
    - >-
      Mis-sizing and late swaps drive rework, rush tailoring, and poor NPS;
      exchange/alteration rates commonly 15–30% for first-time renters.
    - >-
      Inventory mismatch: stylists recommend looks that aren’t available in
      size/date; customers churn when their size/color is out.
    - >-
      Low accessory attach rate (often <25%) despite high-margin accessories;
      poor bundling at checkout.
    - >-
      Fragmented event coordination (groom + groomsmen, school groups, theater
      casts) leads to missed deadlines and incomplete orders.
    - >-
      Poor data and forecasting: shops lack visibility on what styles drive
      conversion, what sizes/lengths to stock, and where sizing risk is highest.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational assistant (site widget, SMS, WhatsApp) that gathers event
      details, venue/date, dress code, vibe, and fit preferences.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware recommendations: only shows SKUs/sizes available for the
      event date, with smart alternates and waitlist options.
    - >-
      Size prediction engine calibrated per shop: uses self-reported
      height/weight/age, fit preference, prior orders, brand-size mappings, and
      garment measurements.
    - >-
      Automated bundling: suggests shirts, shoes, ties, belts, cufflinks,
      shapewear; upsells protection plans and expedited shipping.
    - >-
      Cart + booking link creation: pushes a pre-filled cart to the shop’s
      e-comm/rental system with pickup/return dates and deposit terms.
    - >-
      Group flows: unique links for groomsmen/casts; tracks who has submitted
      sizes; reminders before sizing/booking deadlines.
    - >-
      Staff console: override recommendations, add house notes, flag tricky
      fits, track accuracy and sales impact.
    - >-
      Analytics: fit accuracy, exchange/alteration rates, attach rates,
      conversion by channel/time, stockout-driven loss, and size-curve insights.
    - >-
      Integrations: Shopify/WooCommerce/Squarespace storefronts;
      Booqable/EZRentOut/Shopify rental apps; Square/Lightspeed POS;
      Twilio/WhatsApp; Stripe checkout (or handoff).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 inventory-aware stylist that predicts size and fit, bundles
    accessories, and generates a ready-to-book cart—lifting assisted conversion
    10–25%, reducing size-related rework 30–50%, and increasing AOV 15–25%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rental-specific fit intelligence (trained on exchange/alteration outcomes,
    not just retail returns) plus real-time inventory-aware styling and group
    workflows. Cross-merchant, anonymized fit graph and seasonality models make
    recommendations measurably better over time, and integrations with rental
    platforms shorten deployment to days, not months.
