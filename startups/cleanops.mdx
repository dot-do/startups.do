leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Duplicate leads/contacts/accounts inflate pipeline, waste marketing spend,
      and cause routing conflicts; median duplicate rate in B2B service org CRMs
      is 8–15%, leading to 10–25% campaign waste and 5–12% lower SDR
      productivity.
    - >-
      Inconsistent fields (phone formats, casing, addresses, industry codes)
      break automation and enrichment; form-fills and list uploads add 1–3% new
      malformed records monthly.
    - >-
      Incorrect or missing record ownership causes SLA breaches and poor
      territory coverage; 5–10% of open leads have stale or orphan owners after
      turnover or re-orgs.
    - >-
      Stale records bloat pipeline and dashboards, degrading forecast accuracy
      and executive trust.
    - >-
      Manual dedup projects are error-prone, slow, and expensive (2–4 weeks per
      500k records), often lacking auditability and rollback.
    - >-
      Native CRM dedup and “near-duplicate” tools are limited across objects,
      don’t explain decisions well, and require heavy admin time to operate
      continuously.
  solution:
    - >-
      Zero-friction connectors for Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, and
      Zoho with read-only first-pass audit in 24 hours.
    - >-
      AI identity resolution across leads, contacts, accounts, and custom
      objects, combining fuzzy matching, email/phone normalization, and
      enrichment checks with precision/recall guardrails.
    - >-
      Policy-driven auto-merge engine with explainable scoring, safe thresholds,
      sandbox preview, and human-in-the-loop review queues for edge cases.
    - >-
      Normalization library: names/casing, emails, phone E.164, addresses (USPS
      + global), industries (NAICS/SIC), countries/states (ISO), titles, and
      lifecycle stages.
    - >-
      Ownership repair: reassign orphaned records per territory rules,
      round-robin, or workload; fix account-contact-parent linkages; align
      SDR/AE rules of engagement.
    - >-
      Stale record closure and reactivation rules by segment (e.g., no activity
      180 days) with configurable dispositions and automated nurture re-entry.
    - >-
      Immutable audit trail: before/after snapshots, merge chains, rationale,
      approvals, and instant rollback for compliance.
    - >-
      Scheduled hygiene runs and real-time webhooks; drift detection alerts when
      duplicate rate or field error rate rises above thresholds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously clean, de-duplicate, and normalize your CRM with AI that
    explains every decision. We reduce duplicate rates below 1.5% in 90 days,
    fix ownership automatically, and close stale records—backed by a full audit
    trail and one-click rollback.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable AI identity resolution tuned for Business Support Services,
    powered by a proprietary labeled dataset and vertical normalization
    templates, combined with a governance-grade audit trail and instant
    rollback. This reduces risk for auto-merges, enabling higher automation than
    rules-only tools while meeting compliance requirements.
