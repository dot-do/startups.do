leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts on A-movers (e.g., Pokémon/MTG SKUs, top LEGO sets)
      during peaks (Q4, release weeks), causing lost sales and poor customer
      experience.
    - >-
      Excess/obsolete inventory on C-items and retired SKUs tying up cash;
      limited visibility into true demand and product lifecycles.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone ordering via spreadsheets or vendor portals consumes
      4–10 hours/week per buyer across multiple distributors.
    - >-
      Uncertain and variable supplier lead times (allocations, backorders,
      holidays) make safety stock calculations unreliable.
    - >-
      Case packs/MOQs and shelf capacity constraints are hard to optimize,
      leading to either overbuy or missed buys.
    - >-
      No robust method to forecast new releases or slow movers with intermittent
      demand; POS analytics are descriptive, not prescriptive.
    - >-
      Multi-location retailers lack optimized store-level allocation and
      transfers; decisions are intuition-based.
    - >-
      Limited integration between POS, distributors, and purchasing—POs require
      duplicate data entry and manual reconciliation.
  solution:
    - >-
      SKU-level demand forecasting using seasonality, trend, promotions, and
      release calendars; models tuned for intermittent demand (ABC/XYZ
      segmentation).
    - >-
      Service-level-based reorder points and safety stock that incorporate
      variable lead times, MOQs, case packs, and shelf capacity.
    - >-
      Auto-drafted, editable purchase orders by vendor with line-level rationale
      and budget controls; one-click submit via EDI/email/portal.
    - >-
      New product cold-start using lookalike SKUs (brand, category, price, age
      band) and external signals (preorder velocity, release calendars).
    - >-
      Multi-store allocation engine to distribute central buys to stores based
      on local demand, capacity, and on-hand/on-order.
    - >-
      Exceptions dashboard: imminent stockouts, overstock risks, late POs,
      vendor lead-time drifts; daily refresh and alerts.
    - >-
      Vendor scorecards and lead-time learning: on-time performance, fill rate,
      and variability feed safety stock math.
    - >-
      What-if simulations: target service level vs. working capital;
      promotion/launch uplift scenarios.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce stockouts 20–35% and excess inventory 10–20% while cutting ordering
    time by 50–70%, through vertical-specific AI that forecasts SKU demand,
    computes service-level-based reorder points, and auto-drafts purchase orders
    integrated to your POS and key distributors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific data and models: integrated TCG/LEGO release calendars,
    distributor catalog and lead-time feeds, and anonymized network demand
    signals enable superior cold-start and allocation compared to generalist
    planners. Combined with one-click PO submission to key distributors, the
    workflow moat grows with each integration and retailer added.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Independent Local Game Stores (LGS) with 1–3 locations, 5k–30k active
      SKUs, buying from major TCG distributors (e.g., GTS, Alliance, ACD).

    manual spreadsheet ordering.
