  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage hull and deck concepting is slow and manual (days to weeks)
      and requires scarce senior expertise to iterate on dimensions, Cp,
      deadrise, displacement, and arrangement constraints.
    - >-
      Resistance and powering estimates are inconsistently applied across teams;
      methods vary and results are siloed, making apples-to-apples comparison
      difficult.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size boatbuilders and freelance naval architects lack
      affordable tools to explore 10–100 viable variants quickly before refining
      in high-end CAD/CAE.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either too generic (CAD) or too detailed (full CFD/FEA)
      for the concept phase, causing rework and late design changes.
    - >-
      Exporting early concepts into downstream CAD
      (Rhino/Maxsurf/ShipConstructor) often creates topology issues and forces
      remodelling, losing parametric intent.
    - >-
      Stakeholders (sales, program managers) need quick, credible hydrostatics
      and speed–power curves to make go/no-go decisions, but current workflows
      can’t deliver within bid timelines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parametric hull/deck generator with guardrails: users set targets
      (LOA/LWL, BWL, draft, displacement, Cp, deadrise, transom immersion,
      catamaran demihull spacing) and constraints; the solver returns families
      of feasible variants.
    - >-
      Built-in hydrostatics at multiple displacements/LCG: volume, LCB, KB, KM,
      GMt/GML, waterplane area, prismatic/block coefficients, bulb/tunnel
      options.
    - >-
      Resistance/powering estimates: Holtrop–Mennen
      (displacement/semi-displacement), Savitsky (planing), Molland series
      (catamarans), with sea margin, appendage/roughness allowances, propulsive
      coefficient assumptions, and speed–power curves.
    - >-
      Deck and arrangement placeholders: cabins, cockpit, wheelhouse, tank and
      battery/machinery volumes to validate space claims and weight distribution
      envelopes.
    - >-
      High-quality NURBS surfaces export (3DM/IGES/STEP) and param metadata
      export (CSV/JSON) ready for Rhino/Orca3D/Maxsurf refinement; optional
      Grasshopper components for live linkage.
    - >-
      Variant exploration at scale: generate/screen 50–200 variants per project
      using batch runs and filters (e.g., Cp range, estimated EHP at Fn targets,
      GMt thresholds).
    - >-
      Accuracy feedback: error bands and method applicability warnings;
      side-by-side comparisons versus benchmark dataset and user-supplied
      reference boats.
    - >-
      Collaboration: shareable links, design history, tagging, and comments;
      project templates for common vessel types (planing monohull,
      semi-displacement, catamaran, RIB).
    - >-
      API for integration into internal quoting/bid tools; SSO and team
      management.
    - >-
      Secure, isolated project data per customer; on-prem/virtual private cloud
      option for enterprise.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate credible, constraint-driven hull and deck concepts with
    hydrostatics and resistance in minutes, not days—export-ready for
    Rhino/Maxsurf—reducing concept cycle time by 60–80% while improving decision
    confidence early.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, curated dataset linking parametric hull definitions
    to vetted hydro/resistance outcomes, enabling faster and more accurate
    concept predictions than generic CAD/CFD workflows; embedded in
    Rhino/Grasshopper workflows with export fidelity and variant management that
    competitors lack.
