  problem:
    - >-
      Online apparel and accessories have high return rates (avg 25–40%); 50–70%
      of returns cite size/fit as the primary reason.
    - >-
      Shoppers lack confidence due to inconsistent sizing across brands and
      categories (e.g., denim vs knit, US vs EU sizing), causing abandonment or
      bracketing.
    - >-
      Static size charts and generic fit finders underperform; they don’t learn
      from a retailer’s own return and exchange history.
    - >-
      Retailers incur high reverse logistics costs ($10–$20 per return) and
      inventory depreciation from late-season restocks.
    - >-
      Multi-brand retailers and marketplaces struggle to map fit across brands
      and SKUs at scale, especially for long-tail inventory and accessories
      (belts, hats, gloves, footwear).
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational fit widget on PDP and cart that asks 2–4 adaptive questions
      to infer preferred fit and recommend a size with confidence score.
    - >-
      Brand Fit Graph: maps SKU measurements, fabric stretch, and brand-to-brand
      fit relationships using your historical returns/exchanges and reviews
      data.
    - >-
      Cold-start logic using brand/size charts, crowd fit priors, and product
      attributes (stretch, rise, silhouette) to give credible guidance on day 1.
    - >-
      Personalization for new vs returning shoppers: optional hashed email/ID to
      leverage past purchases; no photos or body scans required.
    - >-

      category-specific question sets and conversion/return models.
    - >-
      Admin dashboard with A/B testing, uplift measurement, and drill-down by
      category, size, and traffic source; export to BI/CDP.
    - >-
      APIs and turnkey apps for Shopify/Plus, BigCommerce, Magento; prebuilt
      integrations with returns platforms (Loop, Narvar), reviews (Yotpo), CDPs
      (Segment).
    - >-
      Multi-language NLP for 20+ locales; supports size systems (US/EU/UK/JP)
      and unit conversion.
    - >-
      Data privacy and security: PII-minimized flows, SOC 2 roadmap, GDPR/CCPA
      compliance; on-premise inference option for enterprise.
    - >-
      In-store associate mode (mobile) to guide sizing for BOPIS/returns
      prevention and to drive exchanges over refunds.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A privacy-first, conversational fit assistant that learns from your brand’s
    returns and exchange history to recommend the right size in under 20
    seconds—lifting conversion 3–8% and reducing size-related returns 10–25%
    within 60 days, with A/B-tested proof and full ROI transparency.
