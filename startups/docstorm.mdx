leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Contractors lose 45–120 minutes per claim assembling photo indexes, damage
      notes, scope items, and narratives; this time compounds during storm
      spikes when crews handle 10–30 inspections/day.
    - >-
      Inconsistent documentation causes adjuster pushback: first-pass approval
      rates for siding often sit at 55–65%, requiring 1–3 supplements and adding
      7–21 days to cycle time.
    - >-
      Photos often lack trusted metadata (GPS/time/authenticity), leading to
      disputes about damage cause/date-of-loss.
    - >-
      Scope line items are not mapped to insurer conventions (e.g., Xactimate
      codes), triggering rework and reduced payout.
    - >-
      Owners rely on manual processes (Google Drive/CompanyCam exports + Word
      docs) with no standard insurer-ready format; quality varies widely by
      sales rep/field tech.
    - >-
      Storm surges create a capacity gap: hiring/training in-house estimators
      for 2–3 months of peak season is expensive and underutilized off-season.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest job artifacts: photos (CompanyCam, device upload), address,
      date-of-loss, materials/manufacturer if known, and brief field notes.
    - >-
      AI computer vision classifies each photo (e.g., hail impact, wind crease,
      manufacturing defect, wear/tear, collateral, soft metals) and tags
      location (elevation, facade, orientation) using photogrammetry cues and
      user inputs.
    - >-
      Auto-build a photo index with per-image annotations, timestamps, GPS, and
      cryptographic hashes for chain-of-custody; flag low-quality images and
      request retakes.
    - >-
      Generate an insurer-ready narrative: weather verification summary
      (hail/wind size/intensity near property and DoL), damage rationale
      (HAAG/VSI-aligned), causation vs. pre-existing, slope/elevation mapping,
      and repair-vs-replace justification by material/manufacturer when
      applicable.
    - >-
      Produce a scoped line-item export with Xactimate-compatible codes and
      quantities, including waste, detach & reset, wrapping, wrap/trim, and
      collateral (soft metals, downspouts, window wraps). Outputs: PDF report,
      CSV/XLSX for import, optional ESX via partner.
    - >-
      Turnaround options: Standard <24 hours; Rush <2 hours (human
      QA-in-the-loop on both).
    - >-
      Integrations: CompanyCam photo import; JobNimbus/AccuLynx job sync; HOVER
      measurements for quantities; weather verification (HailTrace/CoreLogic).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Submit insurer-ready siding documentation in under 10 minutes: AI turns your
    field photos into a verified photo index, damage classification, scoped line
    items, and a clear narrative aligned to insurer conventions—improving
    first-pass approvals and cutting cycle time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A siding-specific, outcomes-labeled dataset and narrative/scoping templates
    accepted by major carriers, combined with human-in-the-loop QA by certified
    reviewers—delivering consistent, rapid, insurer-ready packs at storm surge

    workflows.
