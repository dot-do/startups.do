leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      AML alert volumes are rising 10–25% YoY at many depository institutions
      while headcount growth is constrained, creating backlogs and SLA risk for
      30/60-day SAR filing timelines.
    - >-
      Analysts spend 20–30 minutes per alert on low-value tasks (data gathering,
      summarization, copying case notes) and 2–4 hours per SAR narrative,
      leading to high cost per alert and burnout.
    - >-
      False-positive rates in transaction monitoring exceed 90% for many
      institutions; poor triage wastes capacity and creates inconsistent
      dispositions across analysts.
    - >-
      SAR narrative quality is inconsistent; QA cycles and rework cause delays
      and increase the risk of examiner findings and remediation plans.
    - >-
      Existing tools provide rules and basic prioritization but lack
      explainable, context-rich enrichment and draft narratives that meet
      FinCEN/FFIEC expectations.
    - >-
      Model risk management and audit requirements make it hard to adopt AI
      safely without a human-in-the-loop, full traceability, and validation
      artifacts.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted alert triage: generate concise alert summaries with key risk
      signals, entities, counterparties, and rationale.
    - >-
      Automated enrichment: pull KYC/CDD, negative news, sanctions screening
      context, peer/segment benchmarks, and network relationships; link to
      source citations.
    - >-
      Disposition proposal: recommend close/escalate with confidence scores and
      required next actions; capture analyst feedback to improve.
    - >-
      SAR narrative drafting: produce structured, compliant drafts
      (who/what/when/where/how/why, temporal ordering, amounts, typology) with
      embedded citations.
    - >-
      Explainability and audit: full lineage from source data to output,
      versioned models/prompts, QA checklists, reviewer signoff, immutable logs.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors to major TM/case systems (Actimize, Verafin,
      Hummingbird, Unit21, FICO), cores (Fiserv, Jack Henry, FIS), and data
      providers (World-Check, LexisNexis, ComplyAdvantage).
    - >-
      Governance and safety: human-in-the-loop controls, model risk
      documentation (SR 11-7 style), bias/stability testing, PII redaction,
      RBAC, and VPC/on-prem deployment options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce AML alert handling time 50–70% and SAR drafting time 50–75% with
    explainable, regulator-ready AI that summarizes alerts, enriches activity,
    proposes dispositions, and drafts high-quality SAR narratives—always
    human-in-the-loop, fully auditable, and integrated with your existing case
    management.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Regulator-grade explainability with sentence-level citations to case data
    and a prebuilt model validation pack co-authored by former examiners, plus
    deep integrations to leading TM/case systems enabling rapid, low-risk pilots
    and measurable ROI within 60 days.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    BSA Officers, AML investigators, and compliance leads at savings
    institutions and other depository credit intermediation who must clear
    alerts and file timely, high‑quality SARs without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    Soaring alert volumes, fragmented data, and time‑consuming SAR narratives
    create backlogs, missed timelines, and exam risk—while budgets and staffing
    are tight.
  guide: >-
    AML domain experts and AI engineers with bank‑grade security and
    examiner‑ready auditability. The service summarizes alerts, enriches
    activity, proposes dispositions, and drafts SAR narratives for analyst
    approval—keeping humans in control.
  plan: >-
    1) Securely connect to core/transaction/case systems; 2) Run a 4–6 week
    pilot on historical alerts to calibrate; 3) Go live analyst‑in‑the‑loop—no
    auto‑filing—with full audit trails, KPIs, and training.
  callToAction: Schedule a demo or launch a 4–6 week pilot.
  success: >-
    Faster triage and consistent narratives; reduced backlogs and costs; on‑time
    SARs with documented, risk‑based rationales; happier analysts and smoother
    exams.
  failure: >-
    Without it: growing queues, inconsistent filings, higher costs and burnout,
    and increased risk of exam findings, penalties, or consent orders.

  problem:
    - >-
      Alert volumes and false positives overwhelm small teams, creating costly
      backlogs.

      SAR drafting consumes hours per case; timelines and red flags are hard to
      summarize clearly.
    - >-
      Data lives in silos (KYC, transactions, sanctions, media); enrichment is
      manual.
