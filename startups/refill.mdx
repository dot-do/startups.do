leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Pharmacies lose 5–15% of refill opportunities monthly due to missed or
      late patient outreach, resulting in revenue leakage and lower Star
      Ratings.
    - >-
      Manual phone calls and robocalls are labor-intensive (6–12 staff
      hours/week per store) and yield low response rates, especially outside
      business hours.
    - >-
      Outreach is inconsistent and not personalized by patient risk, language,
      or channel preference, reducing conversion effectiveness.
    - >-
      Pickup/delivery scheduling is fragmented; many patients intend to refill
      but fail to complete pickup or arrange delivery, leading to abandoned
      fills.
    - >-
      Documentation of outreach and outcomes is inconsistent in pharmacy
      systems, making it hard to prove interventions for audits or measure ROI.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into adherence KPIs (PDC/MPR) and campaign
      effectiveness; owners/operators lack real-time ROI dashboards.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (HIPAA, TCPA, CAN-SPAM) and consent management are
      complex and costly to manage in-house.
    - >-
      Integration with diverse pharmacy management systems (PMS) is technically
      challenging, leading to duplicate data entry and errors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest refill queues, due/overdue lists, and sync calendars
      from leading PMS via API/SFTP/connectors.
    - >-
      Risk score and segment patients by chronic class (RASA, Statins,
      Diabetes), lateness, past behavior, language, and channel preference.
    - >-
      Automate two-way outreach across SMS, IVR, and email with compliant
      consent capture and branded pharmacy identity.
    - >-
      Offer immediate options to refill, change to 90-day supply, enroll in med
      sync, or request counseling.
    - >-
      Coordinate pickup/delivery with real-time scheduling windows; integrate
      with delivery partners or in-house drivers.
    - >-
      Capture payment links (optional) and co-pay updates; confirm
      readiness-to-pickup notifications.
    - >-
      Write back all actions and notes to PMS: outcome code (refill yes/no),
      scheduled pickup/delivery time, med sync enrollment, and next touch date.
    - >-
      Escalate complex cases to staff or a live call center with full
      conversation context and auditing.
    - >-
      A/B test outreach cadences and language; optimize per store to maximize
      conversion and minimize opt-outs.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards tracking refill conversion, PDC shifts, staff time
      saved, ROI, and compliance audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase refill conversion and Star Ratings while reducing staff workload:
    compliant, two-way AI outreach that schedules pickup/delivery and writes
    outcomes back to your pharmacy system—proving ROI in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, write-back integrations across multiple PMS plus pre-validated
    adherence playbooks and consent workflows create fast time-to-value and
    defensibility. Continuous learning from cross-store engagement data improves
    personalization while maintaining HIPAA compliance. Outcomes-based pricing
    and audited documentation align incentives and ease procurement with
    PSAOs/wholesalers.
  customerSegments:
    - Independent community pharmacies (single store)
    - Small to mid-size chains (5–200 stores)
