leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-volume claims operations lack consistent, fast triage to flag
      suspicious claims within minutes of FNOL, causing leakage and delayed
      investigations.
    - >-
      SIU teams spend 1–3 hours per case assembling referral packets (timeline,
      entities, red flags, attachments), delaying cycle time and increasing LAE.
    - >-
      Existing fraud scores are opaque; SIU and regulators require clear,
      auditable explanations and state-specific referral forms.
    - >-
      Entity resolution across claimants, providers, adjusters, and vendors is
      fragmented; cross-claim link analysis is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      False positives overwhelm investigators; many carriers refer <2% of claims
      but still see low SIU hit rates (<30%).
    - >-
      Model governance (versioning, bias, drift) and data compliance (PII/PHI,
      SOC 2, state mandates) are hard to maintain and audit.
    - >-
      Integration with core claims systems (Guidewire, Duck Creek) and ISO
      ClaimSearch/NICB is costly and slow, stretching IT capacity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time fraud risk scoring at FNOL and key claim events (estimate
      change, supplemental, provider assignment).
    - >-
      Entity resolution/graph linking across people, providers, vehicles,
      addresses, phone/email, bank accounts, repair shops, attorneys, and
      adjusters.
    - >-
      Explainable scoring with red-flag rationales mapped to NICB indicators and
      carrier-specific rules.
    - >-
      Auto-triggered SIU referrals based on thresholds, watchlists, and rules
      (e.g., staged accidents, treatment patterns).
    - >-
      Packet builder that assembles claim timeline, entity map, linked prior
      claims, anomalies, and attachments (photos, invoices, medical bills).
    - >-
      State- and carrier-specific referral forms (e.g., NICB, state DOI)
      auto-populated; export to PDF/Word and push to case management.
    - >-
      Feedback loop capturing SIU outcomes (accepted/rejected, fraud confirmed,
      savings) to continuously retrain/calibrate models.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box connectors to Guidewire, Duck Creek, ISO ClaimSearch, and
      common case management tools; APIs and SFTP for others.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut SIU cycle time and loss leakage by combining transparent fraud risk
    scoring, auto-generated SIU referrals, and audit-ready investigative packets
    with entity link analysis—deployable in 6–8 weeks, integrated into your
    claims system, and proven to raise SIU hit rates while reducing investigator
    prep time by 70–90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Insurance-specific packet automation with audit-ready explanations mapped to
    NICB/state forms, combined with high-accuracy entity resolution and
    out-of-the-box core system integrations. Continuous feedback loops from
    multi-LOB deployments create a proprietary feature/threshold library and
    benchmarking set. Optional federated learning approach enables cross-carrier
    model improvements without sharing raw PII, compounding performance gains
    over time.
