  problem:
    - >-
      Preparers spend 20–60 minutes per client re-keying prior-year data into
      organizers and carryover fields, creating a busy-season bottleneck.
    - >-
      Client organizers are inconsistently completed by clients; firms must
      backfill missing responses from prior-year returns to keep work moving.
    - >-
      Manual data entry causes carryover errors (NOLs, depreciation, passive
      losses, credits) that lead to rework, notices, or amended returns.
    - >-
      Firms lack a universal, vendor-agnostic tool to parse prior-year PDFs and
      map to their organizer templates across multiple tax software systems.
    - >-
      Seasonality strains staffing; firms can’t easily scale throughput in
      January–March without hiring temps or paying overtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Accept prior-year return PDFs (federal/state, 1040/1120/1120S/1065, K-1s)
      via portal, email-in, or API.
    - >-
      Auto-detect and classify forms/schedules; parse key data (name/SSN/EIN,
      addresses, dependents, filing status, wages, interest/dividends, Sch C/E,
      K-1 pass-through items, credits, depreciation carryovers, NOLs, AMT,
      charitable carryovers, state conformities).
    - >-
      Map extracted data to firm-specific organizer templates
      (ProConnect/Lacerte, UltraTax, CCH Axcess, Drake, TaxAct) and produce
      structured JSON/CSV for import.
    - >-
      Flag missing/mismatched items (e.g., dependents changed, address change,
      prior NOL exists) and generate a short client PBC request list for
      organizer gaps.
    - >-
      Provide a review UI showing source-of-truth snippets with confidence
      scores; 1-click accept/correct and re-export.
    - >-
      Create a carryover summary report for preparer review and archive to DMS
      (SmartVault/ShareFile).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut organizer prep time by 50–70% and reduce carryover errors by 90% with
    98.5%+ accurate AI extraction of prior-year returns, mapped directly into
    your organizer and tax software carryover fields in minutes, not
    hours—secure, vendor-agnostic, and built for peak-season scale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic organizer mapping library and carryover rules engine
    spanning multiple tax platforms; proprietary labeled dataset of prior-year
    returns and K-1 variants; SOC 2-backed, peak-season-tested pipeline with
    burst capacity; deep integrations across both tax software and DMS/practice
    management ecosystems that reduce switching costs.

  problem: >-
    - Villain: Manual data entry and scattered carryovers that create avoidable
    rework.

    - External: Hours spent extracting data from prior-year returns and chasing
    incomplete organizers.

    - Internal: Staff fatigue and bottlenecks during busy season; fear of
    missing critical carryovers.

    - Philosophical: Tax experts shouldn’t be typists—your time should go to

    - Agreement Plan:
      • Start with a limited-scope pilot.
      • Usage-based pricing, no long-term contract.
      • Security-first onboarding with DPA and role-based access.

    - Delayed organizers and frustrated clients.
    - Increased risk of missed carryovers and corrections.
    - Burned-out teams and constrained capacity.
