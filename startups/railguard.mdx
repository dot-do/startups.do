  problem:
    - >-
      Dispatchers and crew offices manually scan rosters for Hours-of-Service
      (HOS) issues, missing subtle cascading risks during disruptions and crew
      reassignments.
    - >-
      Reactive compliance checks happen at tie-up or callout time, not 24–72
      hours ahead, resulting in last-minute recrews, delays, and penalties.
    - >-
      Rules vary by craft, territory, union agreement, and work type (train,
      yard, MOW, signal), making it hard to keep current and consistent across
      shifts and locations.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (crew management, timekeeping, payroll, qualification
      databases) cause data latency and blind spots that lead to preventable
      violations.
    - >-
      Lack of auditable rationale for swaps creates union grievances, crew
      dissatisfaction, and weak defense during regulatory audits.
  solution:
    - >-
      Configurable rules engine for HOS and labor agreements: parameterized by
      craft, territory, rest requirements, qualification/recency,
      deadhead/limbo, call windows, and client-specific provisions.
    - >-
      Predictive risk scoring: ML models forecast likely overruns, tight turns,
      and cascading roster conflicts up to 72 hours ahead with explainable
      factors (duty length, sequence, fatigue indicators, disruption history).
    - >-
      Auto-suggest compliant roster swaps: ranked options that preserve
      qualifications, minimize overtime, and avoid premium pay triggers;
      one-click dispatcher approval and electronic audit trail.
    - >-
      Multichannel notifications: auto-drafted, templated messages for crew,
      dispatch, managers, and clients via SMS, email, in-app, and IVR;
      read-receipt tracking and escalation rules.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: sandbox changes to timetables, outages, or weather
      events to quantify HOS exposure and staffing needs before executing
      changes.
    - >-
      Integrations: APIs/connectors to popular crew management, timekeeping,
      qualification databases, payroll, and incident systems; near-real-time
      data sync (<5-minute latency targets).
    - >-
      Mobile and web portals: dispatcher console, supervisor dashboard, and crew
      app for availability updates, rest acknowledgments, and shift
      confirmations.
    - >-
      Audit/analytics: immutable logs, reason codes for every decision,
      violation heatmaps, union grievance packet generator, and compliance
      reports exportable for regulators and clients.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure cloud (SOC 2/ISO 27001), VPC isolation, or
      on-prem modules for sensitive operators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict, prevent, and prove HOS compliance. RailGuard monitors rosters in
    real time, forecasts violation risk 24–72 hours ahead, drafts compliant swap
    options with union/qualification rules, and automates clear, auditable
    notifications—cutting HOS events, overtime, and delays while improving crew
    trust.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A living, validated library of multi-jurisdiction HOS and union rules plus
    an integration catalog for major rail crew/time systems, combined with
    explainable predictive models trained on real roster/incident
    patterns—creating high switching costs and defensible accuracy that
    incumbents’ static rule checks and generic schedulers lack.
