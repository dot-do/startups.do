  problem:
    - >-
      Recurring but intermittent defects (e.g., stones, bubbles, scratches, tin
      pickup) create yield losses of 1–5% with slow root-cause analysis that can
      take days or weeks.
    - >-
      Existing inline inspection systems flag defects but rarely connect them to
      specific process conditions (furnace/bath/lehr speeds, temperatures,
      coater recipes), leaving engineers to manually correlate siloed data.
    - >-
      Hotspots often migrate over shifts, recipes, or maintenance cycles and go
      unnoticed due to lack of spatiotemporal analytics on defect images and
      line coordinates.
    - >-
      High false positives or inconsistent defect classification across
      plants/lines degrade trust in automated inspection and cause unnecessary
      rejects.
    - >-
      Process experts are time-constrained; tribal knowledge is not captured in
      a repeatable system, leading to repeated issues and training gaps for new
      operators.
    - >-
      Management needs quantifiable ROI from quality programs but can’t easily
      tie inspection data to scrap cost, claims, and customer returns.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize image streams and defect logs from existing inline
      inspection systems; map defects to line coordinates and timestamps.
    - >-
      Spatiotemporal hotspot analytics: cluster recurring defect locations,
      drift over time, and co-occurence patterns; produce heatmaps by shift,
      recipe, and equipment state.
    - >-
      Correlation engine: link hotspots to historian/MES data (furnace/bath/lehr
      temperatures, draw speed, coater power, maintenance events) and rank
      likely contributors using explainable ML.
    - >-
      Predictive warnings: trigger alerts when process signatures match
      pre-hotspot patterns (e.g., 2–6 hours before elevated defect rates).
    - >-
      Defect taxonomy harmonization: standardize and auto-classify defects
      across plants/vendors with active-learning loops and SME feedback.
    - >-
      ROI cockpit: quantify savings by line/defect type; track scrap tonnage
      avoided, FPY, PPM, claims avoided; generate audit-ready reports for
      automotive/architectural customers.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure on-prem or hybrid with edge gateways;
      vendor-agnostic connectors (ISRA VISION, Cognex, OMRON, etc.) and OSIsoft
      PI/AVEVA/InTouch/Ignition integrations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce flat-glass scrap and customer defects by 0.5–1.5% within 90 days by
    turning existing inspection images into an automated, correlated hotspot map
    linked to process conditions, with ranked root-cause hypotheses and
    predictive alerts—no new cameras required.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-plant, glass-specific dataset and models that fuse image-based
    defect hotspots with high-frequency process tags to produce ranked,
    explainable root-cause hypotheses—packaged in an on-prem-first,
    vendor-agnostic solution that requires no new cameras and shows ROI within
    90 days. Partnerships with major inspection and historian vendors accelerate
    integrations competitors struggle with.

    Flat glass operations and quality leaders who need to raise yield, stabilize
    lines, and hit delivery targets.
  problem: >-
    Recurring, hard-to-trace defect hotspots waste glass, trigger rework and
    claims, and leave teams guessing why—when they should have clear, real-time

    We understand the cost of scrap and downtime; our vision AI, purpose-built
    for flat glass, turns your existing inspection images into reliable hotspot
    intelligence correlated with process conditions.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect inspection/camera feeds and process data; 2) Train and calibrate
    on your product mix; 3) Deploy hotspot maps, alerts, and root-cause
    dashboards; 4) Iterate with continuous improvement.

    Schedule a pilot to see your first hotspot map in days—or request a sample
    report using one week of your images.
  success: >-
    Pinpoint root causes quickly, cut scrap and rework, lift first-pass yield,
    prevent customer defects, and run stable, predictable lines with data-driven
    control.
  failure: >-
    Without it, hidden hotspots persist, scrap and claims grow, investigations
    drag on, and margins erode due to preventable defects and downtime.

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Defects recur while root cause hunts drag on.
    - 'Inspection images are stored, not analyzed over time or location.'
    - Manual correlation with process tags is slow and unreliable.
    - Hotspots emerge before SPC or alarms catch them.
    - 'Scrap, rework, and claims rise without clear visibility.'
    - Quality teams drown in thumbnails and spreadsheets.
    - Improvements don’t stick because drift isn’t tracked.
  solution:
    - Use your existing cameras—no new hardware needed.
    - AI detects and classifies defects in real time.
    - >-
      Hotspot maps show where and when defects cluster across the ribbon and
      shifts.
    - >-
      Correlate defects with line speed, furnace zones, coater heads, and
      recipes.
    - Automatic alerts on emerging hotspots and process drift.
    - 'Dashboards for yield, Pareto by defect type, and time-to-root-cause.'
    - Baseline and trend analysis to lock in improvements.
  features:
    - Defect hotspot heatmaps (position vs. time) with drill-down to images.
    - >-
      Glass-specific defect classes: bubbles/seeds, pits, inclusions, scratches,
      roller marks, haze, edge chips.
    - 'Process correlation: ingest SCADA/MES/PLC tags (OPC UA, MQTT, REST, SQL).'
    - 'Filters by line, zone, tool, recipe, batch/lot, shift, and operator.'
    - Change-point detection and anomaly alerts with thresholds per SKU/recipe.
    - Ranked root-cause signals and correlation scores.
    - Auto-generated shift and daily quality reports (PDF/CSV).
    - SPC integration and export to existing QMS.
    - 'Operator UI with live status, thumbnails, and stoplight indicators.'
    - API-first design for MES/LIMS/BI dashboards.
    - On-premise or private cloud deployment; air-gapped option available.
    - 'Role-based access, audit trails, and data retention policies.'
    - Active learning to adapt models to each line with minimal labeling.
    - Historical backfill to quantify past loss and validate ROI.
  steps:
    - >-
      Connect data: point to image streams/folders and process tags (OPC
      UA/CSV/API).
    - 'Backfill: ingest historical images to build a baseline and defect map.'
