  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Misread drawings/specs causing underquote
    - Unknown customer tolerances or coatings
    - Liability for delivery commitments
    - Data/IP confidentiality
  dependencies:
    - Accurate machine rates and labor multipliers
    - Current plate and consumable price lists
    - Shipping rate API or tables
    - Access to ERP/CRM for quote sync
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ-to-quote cycle is slow (median 1–3 hours/RFQ) causing lost bids when
      customers expect responses within 24 hours.
    - >-
      High estimator labor cost and shortages; 1 estimator typically processes
      only 6–12 RFQs/day.
    - >-
      Manual parsing of PDFs/CAD leads to errors (missing bends/welds/finishes)
      causing 3–7 percentage points margin leakage and rework.
    - >-
      Material price volatility and poor nesting estimates lead to 5–12% scrap
      variance and inaccurate material costs.
    - >-
      Fragmented process across email, CAD, spreadsheets, nesting software, and
      ERP increases manual touchpoints (8–15 per RFQ) and quote version
      confusion.
    - >-
      Lack of consistent cost models across cutting, bending, welding,
      finishing, and freight creates inconsistent pricing and slow approvals.
    - >-
      Difficulty integrating with ERP/MRP (JobBOSS2, E2 Shoptech, Global Shop,
      ProShop, Epicor) leads to double entry and data silos.
    - >-
      Compliance/security requirements (ISO 9001, ITAR/CMMC in defense work)
      make cloud tools risky without proper controls.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize RFQs from email/portal: PDFs, DXF/DWG, STEP/IGES,
      BOMs, spec sheets; auto-detect part counts and revisions.
    - >-
      Extract manufacturing features: plate thickness/material, cut
      lengths/holes, bend lines/angles, weld types/lengths, finish specs (blast,
      paint, powder, galvanize), tolerances, QA notes.
    - >-
      Run cost models: auto-nesting for material yield; machine-specific
      cut-time (laser/plasma/waterjet) with pierce counts; press brake setup/run
      time; weld process (MIG/TIG/SAW) time from joint length/position;
      finishing cycle times; packaging and quality; overhead and markup rules.
    - >-
      Fetch material prices (live APIs or vendor price sheets), compute freight
      via LTL estimates from weight/dims and destination, and apply
      customer-specific pricing tiers.
    - >-
      Generate itemized quote with alternates/options, lead times, and risk
      buffers; one-click sync to ERP for routing, BOM, and CRM follow-up.
    - >-
      Closed-loop calibration: compare estimates to actuals (clocked times,
      drops/scrap, buy costs) to continuously tighten accuracy per machine,
      material, and estimator.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn unstructured RFQs (drawings + specs) into calibrated, itemized quotes
    in minutes—covering material, cutting, bending, welding, finishing, and
    freight—integrated to your ERP, with accuracy that improves from your shop’s
    historicals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop accuracy improvement driven by each shop’s actuals (clocked
    times, buy costs, scrap), yielding a proprietary dataset and per-machine
    calibration that is hard to replicate; deep ERP/nesting integrations and
    ITAR/private cloud support create switching costs and trust moats.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Estimators and owners at plate fabrication shops who need to turn customer
    RFQs (drawings + specs) into accurate quotes fast.
  problem: >-
    RFQs arrive in multiple formats and high volume; manual takeoffs are slow
    and inconsistent, causing missed deadlines, pricing errors, and margin
    erosion—when quoting should be predictable and quick.

    1) Upload PDFs/CAD/specs. 2) AI extracts geometry and BOM, then costs
    material, cutting, bending, welding, finishing, and freight using your rates
    and rules. 3) You review, adjust, and export the itemized quote to ERP/CRM.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free trial or book a 20-minute demo; send one RFQ and get a
    ready-to-send quote in minutes.
  success: >-
    Respond 5–10x faster, raise win rates, standardize pricing, protect margins,
    free up estimator time, and deliver clear, professional, itemized quotes
    customers trust.
  failure: >-
