  problem:
    - >-
      Operators receive methane alerts from satellites, aerial LiDAR, drones,
      and OGI but lack a standardized workflow to validate, prioritize, and turn
      them into field repairs quickly.
    - >-
      Regulatory and commercial pressure (EPA methane rule, IRA Methane
      Emissions Reduction Program fee, OGMP 2.0, EU Methane Regulation) requires
      auditable, quantifiable abatement evidence that many operators cannot
      generate at scale.
    - >-
      Fragmented tech stack (SCADA, CMMS like SAP PM/Maximo, GIS, OGI vendors)
      leads to slow detection-to-repair cycles (often weeks), high false
      positives, and missed super-emitters.
    - >-
      Lack of consistent quantification and chain-of-custody makes it difficult
      to claim avoided emissions/fees or meet certification (MiQ/OGMP 2.0) and
      investor ESG requirements.
    - >-
      Field teams are overloaded; without automated triage and pre-filled work
      orders, high-value leaks compete with low-impact tasks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-sensor ingestion (Sentinel-2/Landsat/EMIT/MethaneSAT/GHGSat, aerial
      LiDAR, drone TDLAS, fixed sensors, OGI video) with automated
      co-registration to operator assets.
    - >-
      Quantification using atmospheric inverse modeling (e.g., NOAA HRRR winds)
      with uncertainty estimates; thresholds tuned by basin and asset type.
    - >-
      Risk and ROI prioritization engine combining estimated leak rate (kg/h),
      fee exposure ($/ton CH4), safety, proximity to critical infrastructure,
      and production impact.
    - >-
      Automated CMMS integration (SAP PM, Maximo, Oracle EAM, IFS, Dynamics 365
      FS) to generate work orders with pre-populated tasks, parts, permits,
      access notes, GIS waypoints, and SOPs.
    - >-
      Mobile field app workflows: accept/decline, on-site validation checklist,
      OGI “before/after” capture, parts used, and repair confirmation.
    - >-
      Audit pack generation: detection imagery, quantification method,
      timestamps, personnel, chain-of-custody, repair evidence, and post-repair
      verification; OGMP 2.0 and EPA-ready reports.
    - >-
      Alert governance: deduplication across sensors, suppression windows, and
      SLA tracking; integration with SERP notifications.
    - >-
      Impact reporting: avoided emissions (tCH4), avoided fee ($), gas saved
      (MCF), cost per ton abated, and time-to-repair dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn methane plumes into repairs in days, not weeks. PlumeOps ingests
    satellite/OGI/aerial detections, quantifies and prioritizes them by cost and
    risk, and auto-creates CMMS work orders with a regulator-ready audit
    pack—cutting methane fees, product loss, and ESG risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    End-to-end “detection-to-repair” automation with regulator-ready audit packs
    and native CMMS integrations, plus a growing proprietary dataset of
    plume-to-asset mappings and validated outcomes that continuously improve
    prioritization and reduce false positives—capabilities that detection-only
    vendors and in-house teams struggle to replicate at scale.

  character: >-
    Operations, maintenance, and ESG leaders at natural gas producers who must
    find, prioritize, and fix methane leaks fast without inflating OPEX or
    missing compliance targets.
  problem: >-
    Leak signals from satellites and OGI are fragmented and noisy. Teams lack a
    clear triage-to-workflow path, leading to slow repairs, lost gas, regulatory
    risk, and weak auditability.
  guide: >-
    Methane Emissions Triage & Workorder Agent—an AI built for natural gas
    extraction (NAICS 211130). We pair plume analytics with field pragmatism and
    CMMS/regulatory expertise to turn detections into action.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect satellite/OGI feeds and CMMS; 2) AI ranks plumes by volume,
    safety, cost-of-delay, and asset criticality; 3) Auto-generate routed work
    orders with parts/skills; 4) Close with OGI evidence and quantified
    abatement; 5) Export MRV-ready audit packs.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and start a 60-day pilot. Connect your feeds and see
    prioritized work orders within 7 days.
  success: >-
    Fast leak-to-fix cycles, verified reductions, recovered product,
    MRV-compliant records, and clear ROI—crews do the right work first, every
    time.
  failure: >-
    Leaks linger, emissions intensity rises, fines and permit risks escalate,
    gas is lost, and there is no defensible audit trail for regulators or
    investors.

  problem:
    - >-
      Detections are scattered across satellite, OGI, aerial, and fixed
      sensors—no unified triage.
    - Manual review slows LDAR; leaks persist longer than they should.
    - >-
      Crews get work orders without context, causing repeat visits and wasted
      truck rolls.
    - >-
      Duplicates and false positives inflate costs and distract from high-impact
      leaks.
    - Regulatory and ESG reporting consumes weeks and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Leaders lack clear KPIs on methane intensity, time-to-mitigate, and
      abatement ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify all methane signals into a single triage queue with source
      credibility and confidence.
    - >-
      AI prioritizes by emission rate, safety risk, asset criticality, carbon
      cost, and SLAs.
