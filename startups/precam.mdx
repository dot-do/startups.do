  problem:
    - >-
      Manual pre-CAM DFM review consumes 20–60 minutes per job for high-mix
      fabs; with 200–2,000 jobs/month, this is 67–2,000 engineer-hours/month.
    - >-
      10–30% of incoming jobs need back-and-forth with customers due to
      manufacturability issues (annular ring, solder mask slivers,
      drill-to-copper, acid traps), adding 0.5–2 days to cycle time and hurting
      on-time delivery.
    - >-
      Fab-specific capability rules are poorly captured and inconsistently
      applied; rule drift leads to variability in quality and preventable
      scrap/rework (1–3% yield loss).
    - >-
      Existing DFM tools are rule-based and brittle; they flag issues but rarely
      propose context-aware fixes aligned to the fab’s process limits.
    - >-
      Data formats are fragmented (Gerber RS-274X/X2, ODB++, IPC-2581);
      conversion and layer mapping errors cause misses and false flags.
    - >-
      CAM engineer shortages and high turnover increase training burden; ramping
      new hires on rule interpretation takes 2–3 months.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-format ingestion with robust parsers for Gerber X/X2, ODB++, and
      IPC-2581; automatic layer stack/dielectric/drill mapping and unit
      normalization.
    - >-
      Hybrid rules+AI engine: codified capability rules per fab (clearances,
      annular ring, solder mask, silkscreen-to-pad, drill-to-copper, copper
      balance, min trace/space, slot specs) augmented by ML models trained on
      historical CAM flags to detect complex patterns (acid traps, teardrop
      risk, unintended acute angles, mask slivers).
    - >-
      Interactive DFM report: per-layer annotated issues, severity-weighted risk
      score, and prioritized fix suggestions; one-click acceptance to generate
      fixed artwork deltas or a patch file (Gerber/ODB++), plus designer-facing
      guidance text.
    - >-
      Fab rule library management: versioned capability profiles by material set
      and line (e.g., 1–2L FR4 standard vs. 8–12L HDI), with approval workflows
      and audit trail.
    - >-
      APIs and EDA plugins: REST API for portals/MES/ERP; plugins for Altium,
      KiCad, Cadence Allegro, and Siemens Xpedition to run checks pre-release
      and export corrected geometry/DRC presets.
    - >-
      Security-first deployment: SOC 2-ready cloud, EU/US data residency, and
      on-prem/air-gapped option for ITAR/EAR-sensitive customers.
    - >-
      Quoting assist: go/no-go with constraint deltas and suggested upcharges
      when design exceeds baseline capability (e.g., 3 mil trace requires HDI
      line) to improve quote accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, fab-aligned DFM precheck that ingests Gerber/ODB++/IPC-2581,
    produces a quantified risk score, and generates specific, auto-applicable
    fix suggestions mapped to your process rules—cutting CAM time by 30–50%,
    reducing back-and-forth by 50%, and improving first-pass yield 1–2%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-fab dataset linking DFM flags, accepted waivers, auto-fixes,
    and downstream yield—enabling fix recommendations calibrated to real process
    windows rather than generic rules. Combined with versioned, line-specific
    capability libraries and tight EDA integration, this creates a data and
    workflow moat that rule-only tools lack.
  customerSegments:
    - PCB fabricators (SMB to mid-size; high-mix/low-volume; quick-turn)
    - Enterprise fabs and captive plants (on-premise/air-gapped)
