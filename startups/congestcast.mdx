  problem:
    - >-
      Day-ahead and intra-day LMPs are highly volatile and spatially
      heterogeneous; traders and asset operators struggle to anticipate
      congestion-driven price spikes at the node/constraint level.
    - >-
      Public ISO/RTO feeds are fragmented, differently formatted, and
      time-lagged; integrating weather, load, outages, and topology changes into
      a coherent, timely signal is non-trivial.
    - >-
      Existing tools often provide deterministic hub/zone forecasts; few offer
      calibrated probabilistic forecasts of constraint binding at the
      flowgate/element level needed for actionable bidding, CRR/FTR positioning,
      and battery dispatch.
    - >-
      Outage normalization and real-time topology awareness are hard; most teams
      lack automated parsing of transmission outage postings and contingency
      models, leading to model drift and blind spots.
    - >-
      In-house models are expensive to build and maintain (specialized talent,
      MLOps, 24/7 reliability) and often underperform during atypical weather or
      rare grid states.
    - >-
      Operators of storage and renewables need high-frequency, localized LMP
      forecasts to optimize charge/discharge and bids; without granular
      probabilistic signals they leave PnL on the table and face higher
      imbalance risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion layer that ingests and normalizes ISO/RTO public feeds (DA/RT
      LMPs, SCED/SCUC artifacts, constraints, outages), high-resolution weather
      (HRRR, NAM, GFS/ECMWF), load forecasts, renewable generation, and topology
      updates.
    - >-
      Hybrid modeling: physics-informed DC-OPF approximations and contingency
      modeling combined with graph neural networks and gradient-boosted trees to
      map from state variables to nodal LMPs and flowgate binding probabilities.
    - >-
      Probabilistic outputs: full predictive distributions for LMPs (per
      node/hub/zone) and calibrated probabilities for individual constraints
      binding by interval (e.g., 5-min RT, hourly DA).
    - >-
      Scenario engine: user-defined what-ifs for outages, load/wind/solar
      deviations, and intertie flows; returns LMP and binding probability deltas
      in seconds to minutes.
    - >-
      Delivery: low-latency REST/WS APIs, Python SDK, and web dashboard with
      alerting and portfolio views; optional Excel plugin for quick adoption by
      traders.
    - >-
      Backtesting and explainability: historical performance reports with
      MAE/RMSE, Brier score, coverage; feature importance and topology drivers
      to support model trust and risk review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    ISO-grade, probabilistic congestion and LMP forecasting at nodal and
    constraint granularity, updated day-ahead and intra-day within minutes of
    new data, with calibrated binding probabilities, scenario tools, and
    plug-and-play APIs that measurably improve trading PnL and operational
    decisions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, outage-normalized topology graph and constraint library
    combined with a calibrated physics + ML stack purpose-built for nodal and
    constraint-level probabilistic forecasts, delivering faster adaptation to
    grid changes and rare-event regimes than generic ML or deterministic tools;
    plus normalized multi-ISO coverage and backtested economic impact libraries
    that reduce time-to-value for traders and asset operators.
