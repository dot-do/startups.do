leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual laytime/demurrage work is slow and error-prone: 3–8 hours/claim
      across multiple spreadsheets and emails, with 10–20% recalculation rates
      after counterparty challenges.
    - >-
      Clause interpretation complexity (BIMCO forms, rider clauses,
      WIPON/WIBON/WCCON/WTS/WWD/SHINC/SHEX, pumping warranties, exceptions)
      leads to inconsistent outcomes and leakage of 2–5% per claim.
    - >-
      Missed time bars and poor claim hygiene: 3–7% of claims expire or are
      discounted due to late or incomplete filings and missing evidence bundles.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across CP, SoF, NOR, logs, emails, and port systems;
      operators spend 30–60 minutes per claim hunting for documents and
      reconciling versions.
    - >-
      Limited visibility and portfolio analytics: management lacks a real-time
      view of exposure, cycle times, root causes, recovery rates, or
      counterparty behavior.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit burden: proving calculation logic and decision
      history to P&I clubs, auditors, and courts is labor-intensive.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parses charterparty and riders, classifies clauses (BIMCO and custom),
      and builds a rule set for the specific fixture.
    - >-
      Normalizes and interprets Statement of Facts (SoF), NOR, logs, weather,
      and port events; constructs a transparent timesheet with stoppages and
      exceptions automatically applied.
    - >-
      Auto-calculates laytime/demurrage/despatch across SHEX/SHINC, weather
      working rules, shifting, bunkering, strikes, and pumping/pressure
      warranties, with scenario comparison.
    - >-
      Generates claim letters and evidence bundles (SoF, NOR, CP extracts,
      calculation sheets, emails) with citation links to clauses and events.
    - >-
      Tracks time bars and counterparty deadlines; auto-issues reminders and
      draft notices; maintains an audit trail and version control.
    - >-
      Provides negotiation workspace with redlines, counter-calculation ingest,
      and variance analysis; logs concessions and precedent management.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to voyage/ops systems (Veson/Dataloy), email
      (SEDNA/O365), and DMS/ERP; SSO, SOC 2/GDPR-ready; cloud or private
      VPC/on-prem options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prepare a defensible, clause-aware demurrage claim in minutes, not
    hours—auditable, time-bar safe, and integrated with your voyage workflow.
    Improve recovery by 2–5%, cut cycle time by 70%, and standardize outcomes
    portfolio-wide.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Clause-aware engine plus a growing proprietary corpus of annotated CPs/SoFs
    and negotiated outcomes validated with P&I clubs and law firms. Transparent,
    audit-grade calculations and evidence bundles build institutional trust.
    Deep integrations with voyage/ops/email systems reduce switching costs and
    create workflow lock-in.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Voyage operations, chartering, and claims teams who need accurate,
    defensible laytime/demurrage—fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: Complex charterparty clauses, inconsistent SoFs, scattered
    evidence, manual spreadsheets, and tight time bars.

    - Internal: Anxiety about miscounts, missed clauses, and rework that delays
    cash.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose money because paperwork is harder than
    shipping.
  guide: >-
    We understand laytime pressure—we’ve sat in the ops/claims seat. Our
    maritime-trained AI and rules engine parse CPs and SoFs, apply exceptions
    transparently, and produce an audit-ready timeline with evidence.
    Enterprise-grade security and clear explanations, not a black box.
  plan: >-
    - 1) Upload CP, addenda, and SoF (docs, email, or API).

    - 2) AI parses clauses, applies rules (SHEX, weather, stoppages, NOR
    validity), and calculates laytime/demurrage with a clear audit trail.

    - 3) Review, finalize, and export a complete claim pack: timesheet,
    calculations, invoice, and evidence bundle—ready to send.

    - Agreement: You own your data; transparent calculations; easy export and
    API integration.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a demo; Start a pilot; Connect the API.

    - Transitional: Download a sample claim pack; Get the Laytime Accuracy
    Checklist.
  success: >-
    - File claims in hours, not weeks, and recover cash faster.

    - Reduce leakage and disputes with consistent, transparent calculations.

    - Hit time bars confidently with complete evidence bundles.

    - Free teams from manual spreadsheets to focus on voyage performance and
    negotiation.
  failure: >-
    - Missed time bars and under-claimed demurrage.

    - Costly disputes, write-offs, and margin erosion.

    - Burned team hours and reputational damage with counterparties and
    insurers.
