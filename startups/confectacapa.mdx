  problem:
    - >-
      Complaint and deviation intake is manual (emails, phone, spreadsheets)
      causing 2–5 day delays before triage; information quality varies and is
      often incomplete.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is inconsistent across plants and shifts; tribal
      knowledge about issues like stickiness, sugar bloom, off-flavor, or
      foreign matter is not centrally captured or searchable.
    - >-
      CAPA quality is uneven; actions are generic, not risk-based, and often
      fail auditor scrutiny (GFSI/SQF/BRCGS), leading to repeat incidents and
      audit findings.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across QMS, ERP/MES, LIMS, environmental monitoring, SPC,
      and supplier portals; linking incidents to batches/ingredients is
      time-consuming.
    - >-
      Quality teams are understaffed; high turnover and training burden increase
      cycle times and error rates.
    - >-
      Cost of non-quality (scrap, rework, downgrades, credits, lost shelf-life)
      is opaque; plants lack timely trend detection across lines, seasons, and
      suppliers.
    - >-
      Regulatory exposure: inadequate documentation, incomplete CAPA
      effectiveness checks, and slow complaint response times increase risk of
      recalls and non-conformances.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered intake: ingest emails, web forms, call transcripts, photos, and
      lab reports; auto-extract batch/lot, product, symptom, severity, and
      customer details.
    - >-
      Triage automation: severity scoring (consumer safety, regulatory, brand),
      duplicate detection, and routing to the right owner within minutes.
    - >-
      Root-cause hypothesis engine: confectionery-specific failure modes (e.g.,
      sugar bloom due to cooling humidity/DE ratio, stickiness due to high water
      activity, off-flavor from flavor oxidation, foreign matter from sieving
      failure) with confidence-ranked causes and required data checks.
    - >-
      CAPA drafting: generates specific, risk-ranked corrective and preventive
      actions mapped to HACCP/HarPC/BRCGS clauses; auto-assigns owners/due
      dates, proposes verifications and effectiveness checks.
    - >-
      Data linkage: connects incidents to ERP/MES batches, LIMS results, SPC
      trends, environmental logs, and supplier COAs; builds an auditable trace
      and fishbone/5-Why or FMEA artifacts.
    - >-
      Trend detection: clusters similar incidents, flags emerging patterns
      (e.g., seasonal humidity, supplier lot drift), and alerts before
      escalation.
    - >-
      Audit-ready documentation: one-click generation of CAPA packets with
      evidence, approvals, and change control history; multilingual support.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: quality users edit and approve drafts; feedback
      continually improves models under strict governance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Compress complaint-to-CAPA cycle time from days to hours with
    confectionery-specific AI that drafts audit-ready CAPAs, links to batches
    and suppliers, and learns from every incident to prevent repeats—without
    replacing your existing QMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A confectionery-specific knowledge graph and CAPA library trained on real
    plant data and auditor feedback, delivering high-precision root-cause and
    action suggestions that generic QMS or horizontal AI tools lack—augmented by
    privacy-preserving cross-client trend signals and deep integrations into
    manufacturing data sources.

    QA and Operations leaders at nonchocolate confectionery plants (gummies,
    hard candy, caramels, chews) who must resolve quality incidents fast without
    sacrificing compliance or throughput.
  problem: >-
    External: complaints/deviations (stickiness, sugar bloom, off‑flavor,
    foreign matter) pile up while manual triage and CAPA drafting are slow.
    Internal: teams feel overwhelmed by scattered data, rework, and audit
    anxiety. Philosophical: food quality shouldn’t rely on guesswork or
    paperwork delays.
  guide: >-
    We understand plant‑floor realities—tight runs, seasonality, and audit
    pressure—and we’ve built an AI co‑pilot informed by food science and QMS
    best practices, aligned to HACCP/GFSI/FSMA expectations.
  plan: >-
    1) Intake: Connect complaint/deviation channels; auto‑normalize incidents.
    2) Triage: Generate probable root‑cause hypotheses tailored to confectionery
    (moisture migration, crystallization, thermal/processing, sanitation,
    allergens, supplier). 3) CAPA: Draft risk‑ranked CAPAs with tasks, owners,
    due dates, and verification steps; route to your QMS for approval and
    tracking.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute pilot demo and connect a sample dataset.
    Transitional: Download sample CAPA drafts and an incident triage checklist.
  success: >-
    Faster investigations, fewer repeat deviations, audit‑ready documentation,
    shorter hold times, protected yield and margins, stronger customer trust,
    and calmer, focused teams.
  failure: >-
    Slow investigations, recurring defects, audit findings, potential recalls,
    wasted batches, margin erosion, and burned‑out teams.
