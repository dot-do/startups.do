leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Patchwork regulations: State, county, and city rules change frequently
      (flavor bans, nicotine caps, product registration lists, pack size
      minimums, shipping restrictions, license requirements), making manual
      tracking error-prone.
    - >-
      Manual processes: Many wholesalers rely on spreadsheets/tribal knowledge.
      This causes slow order reviews, inconsistent decisions, and gaps during
      staff turnover.
    - >-
      ERP gaps: Most ERPs/WMS/OMS lack granular, locality-level rule engines.
      State-level blocks miss municipal ordinances; custom scripting is brittle
      and hard to maintain.
    - >-
      Regulatory exposure: Shipments that violate local rules can trigger fines,
      seizure, chargebacks, and license risk; lack of an audit trail complicates
      state PACT/excise audits.
    - >-
      Revenue leakage: Blanket state-level blocking to avoid risk causes lost
      sales in compliant jurisdictions within restricted states (e.g.,
      city-specific bans).
    - >-
      Slow change management: Law changes, emergency orders, and AG guidance
      often take weeks to be reflected in internal systems; no SLA or systematic
      governance.
    - >-
      No visibility: Leadership lacks metrics like violation risk, false
      positive blocks, and compliance coverage by jurisdiction/SKU.
  solution:
    - >-
      Regulatory knowledge graph: Continuously ingests and normalizes
      state/county/city laws, AG guidance, emergency orders, product
      registration lists, and enforcement bulletins; curated by analysts and
      validated by counsel.
    - >-
      SKU intelligence: AI/NLP classifies SKUs by attributes that matter for
      rules (e.g., flavor category, nicotine mg/mL, product type,
      disposable/refillable, device w/closed pods, package size, synthetic vs.
      tobacco-derived) from PDP, GTIN, manufacturer docs.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction resolution: Address geocoding and boundary matching down to
      incorporated city/township for correct rule set selection; handles
      unincorporated areas and special districts.
    - >-
      Policy engine & order blocking: Sub-200ms API decisioning to
      allow/block/warn line items during order capture (ERP, EDI 850, B2B
      portal). Returns reason codes and human-readable explanations.
    - >-
      Change management SLA: Monitors bills and notices; publishes change
      alerts; enforces rules by effective date with 72-hour update SLA, 24-hour
      for emergency orders.
    - >-
      Audit trail & evidence: Immutable logs of decisions, rule versions,
      citations; exportable packets for state audits and internal QA.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: Bulk test SKU/jurisdiction scenarios; run last 90 days
      of orders to quantify risk, false positives, and revenue opportunity.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: Role-based overrides with justification, expiration,
      and downstream reporting; configurable tolerances by customer/license
      class.
    - >-
      Integrations: Prebuilt connectors for NetSuite, Acumatica, MS Dynamics 365
      BC/FO, SAP Business One, Sage X3/100, Odoo; EDI via SPS/Cleo/TrueCommerce;
      shipping via EasyPost/ShipEngine; tax overlay via Avalara Excise/Sovos.
    - >-
      License & registration management: Track customer reseller/retail licenses
      and state product registration lists; block by license class or
      unregistered SKU.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always-current, machine-readable compliance matrix that maps every SKU to
    every US jurisdiction and enforces it at order time. Reduce violations and
    fines to near-zero, recover compliant revenue otherwise lost to blanket
    blocks, and pass audits with a defensible trail—without slowing down the
    cart or the warehouse.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, locality-level rule corpus fused with a SKU
    attribute knowledge graph—trained on tobacco/ENDS-specific labels—and
    embedded directly into ERP/EDI order flows. Feedback from live decision
    outcomes creates a proprietary loop improving precision/recall and coverage
    that generic tax or state-level tools cannot match. Early integrations and
    SOC 2 certification raise switching costs and trust barriers.

  problem:
    - 'Patchwork rules vary by state, county, and city—and change constantly.'
    - >-
      Illegal shipments risk fines, license loss, and damaged distributor
      relationships.
    - Spreadsheets and tribal knowledge don’t scale or survive turnover.
    - 'ERPs and portals can’t block at SKU x ship-to across CSR, web, and EDI.'
    - >-
      Flavor bans, nicotine limits, PMTA status, and age/license rules are hard
      to encode.
    - No clear audit trail for why an order was allowed or blocked.
  solution:
    - Live compliance matrix mapping every SKU to every locality’s rules.
    - 'Real-time warn or hard-block in ERP entry, web checkout, and EDI 850.'
    - 'AI-extracted rule updates from statutes and bulletins, human-validated.'
    - Clear “why blocked” explanations with sources and rule versions.
    - 'Seamless integrations with ERP, OMS, eCommerce, and EDI.'
    - 'Simulation mode to test routes, customers, and catalogs before go-live.'
  features:
    - 'Locality precision: state → county → city stacking and overrides.'
    - >-
      Attribute-aware rules: nicotine mg/mL, flavor profile, device type,
      disposable vs refillable, PMTA status.
    - License gating by customer type; manage license records and expirations.
    - Carrier policy checks and adult-signature flags (USPS/UPS/FedEx).
    - Address validation and geocoding to the correct jurisdiction.
    - Real-time updates with version history and effective dates.
    - 'Order channel coverage: CSR screens, web portal, mobile rep app, EDI.'
    - >-
      Enforcement modes: observe, soft warn, hard block; overrides with
      approvals.
    - 'Audit trail: who, what, where, why blocked; exportable reports.'
    - >-
      Dashboards: blocked orders, revenue at risk, hotspot localities, top
      offending SKUs.
    - 'API + webhooks + connectors (NetSuite, Acumatica, SAP B1, Dynamics, Sage).'
    - Bulk import and mapping for SKUs and attributes via CSV/API.
    - Sandbox and testing to simulate compliance before promotions or launches.
  steps:
    - Connect your ERP/OMS/eCommerce or EDI feed.
    - 'Import SKUs and map key attributes (flavor, nicotine, device type, PMTA).'
    - Sync customers and ship-to addresses; validate geocodes.
    - 'Choose enforcement mode: observe, warn, or block with overrides.'
    - Run simulations and coverage reports; fix gaps in SKU attributes.
    - Go live; monitor exceptions and audits; tune rules as regulations change.
