  title: RFQ-to-Quote Automation for Nonferrous Forgings
  description: >-

  steps:
    - Ingest email/portal submission and store artifacts
    - 'OCR drawings and extract callouts, tolerances, surface finish, quantities'
    - >-

      trim allowance
    - >-
      Estimate forging strokes, press time, die changeover, furnace time, NDT
      and HT routing
    - >-
      Apply parametric cost model (material, labor, machine, overhead, tooling
      amortization)
    - >-
      Generate risk notes (tight tolerances, thin webs, extreme aspect ratios)
      and alternates (near-net vs finish-forge)

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as mixed-format PDFs/STEP files with incomplete or ambiguous
      specs, requiring 2–6 hours of skilled engineer time per quote and creating
      bottlenecks during peaks.
    - >-
      Cycle-time, material yield, and routing estimates rely on tribal
      knowledge; variability leads to margin leakage (2–5 pts) and inconsistent
      pricing across estimators.
    - >-
      Quoting backlogs delay responses; slow turnaround (>48 hours) reduces win
      rates in high-velocity segments (industrial, automotive).
    - >-
      Existing ERP/CPQ tools capture prices, not process physics (flash
      allowance, reductions, die life, press availability), making cost models
      simplistic or manual.
    - >-
      High compliance burden (ITAR/EAR, customer NDAs, AMS/ASTM specs) increases
      risk of non-compliant quotes and missed adders (FAI/PPAP/NDT/HT).
    - >-
      Manual extraction of dimensions, tolerances, and alloy specs from drawings
      is error-prone (missed radii, draft angles, datums), leading to rework and
      renegotiation.
    - >-
      Lack of closed-loop learning from won/lost quotes and actuals prevents
      systematic improvement of estimates and pricing strategy.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parsing of RFQs/drawings (PDF/2D/3D CAD) extracts geometry, tolerances,
      alloy/specs; flags missing/ambiguous data.
    - >-
      Physics- and rules-based engine estimates stock size, flash allowance,
      material yield, die complexity, cycle times (preform, forging hits, trim,
      HT, NDT, machining).
    - >-
      Automated routing suggestion by process (closed-die, open-die, upset, ring
      rolling) with press/hammer selection and queue-time heuristics.
    - >-
      Quote pricing module applies labor, burden, material, scrap recovery, tool
      amortization, quality/compliance adders (FAI/PPAP/NADCAP), and target
      margin logic.
    - >-
      Risk scoring highlights drawing gaps, tolerance outliers, special
      processes, export control, and capacity conflicts; recommends questions to
      customer.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI with version control; one-click generation of
      quote package (cover letter, terms, lead time, risk notes).
    - >-
      Integrations with ERP/CPQ/MES (Epicor, JobBOSS/ECI, Infor) to sync items,
      routings, costs, and won/lost outcomes for model retraining.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: tenant isolation, on-prem/private cloud option, ITAR
      workflows (access controls, logging, data retention).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs and drawings into accurate, auditable, risk-scored quotes in
    minutes, not days—combining forging-specific AI vision, physics-aware cost
    models, and closed-loop learning to boost win rates and protect margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, forging-specific models trained on proprietary shop data and
    actuals, combined with a validated rules engine and ITAR-capable
    deployments; hard to replicate without deep domain datasets, SME know-how,
    and compliance posture.
