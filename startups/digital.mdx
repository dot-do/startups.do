leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fixity verification across heterogeneous storage (cloud, tape, on‑prem) is
      manual, slow, and inconsistent, leading to undetected bit rot and silent
      corruption.
    - >-
      PREMIS event logging is fragmented or absent; preservation actions are not
      consistently captured to a standard, complicating audits and
      chain‑of‑custody proof.
    - >-
      Existing tools don’t scale to tens or hundreds of millions of files;
      scheduled checks overrun maintenance windows and create operational risk.
    - >-
      Cold storage (e.g., Glacier Deep Archive, LTO) fixity is rare due to
      retrieval costs and operational overhead, leaving long‑term risk
      unquantified.
    - >-
      False positives (e.g., path changes, storage lifecycle transitions) and
      noisy alerts overwhelm small teams; triage and root cause analysis are
      time‑consuming.
    - >-
      Reporting for auditors and funders (ISO 16363/TRAC/NDSA Levels) is manual;
      compiling evidence across systems takes days to weeks.
    - >-
      Inconsistent checksum algorithms (MD5/ETag/CRC/SHA256) and metadata
      practices hinder cross‑platform validation and PREMIS mapping.
    - >-
      Procurement/security requirements (SSO, audit logs, PII protections, SOC
      2) limit adoption of open‑source or ad‑hoc scripts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Universal connectors and lightweight agents for S3/GCS/Azure, on‑prem
      object (Ceph/MinIO), POSIX/NFS, and tape/LTO catalogs; supports
      precomputed checksums and on‑demand hashing.
    - >-
      Policy‑driven fixity scheduling (full, rolling, and sampled) optimized by
      storage class and retrieval costs; cold storage workflows with cost
      estimates and throttling.
    - >-
      Standards‑compliant PREMIS 3.x event store with mints for event
      identifiers, immutability options, and export to METS/PREMIS and JSON‑LD.
    - >-
      AI‑assisted anomaly detection and summaries: correlate storage lifecycle
      events, versioning, renames/moves, and checksum mismatches; propose next
      actions.
    - >-
      Evidence‑ready reporting mapped to ISO 16363, TRAC, and NDSA Levels of
      Digital Preservation, including signed reports and audit “evidence packs.”
    - >-
      APIs and webhooks to update downstream systems (Archivematica, Preservica,
      Rosetta, Samvera/Fedora) and create tickets in Jira/ServiceNow for
      remediation.
    - >-
      Role‑based access control, SSO/SAML/OIDC, and comprehensive audit logging
      to satisfy institutional IT/security requirements.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One pane of glass for fixity and PREMIS across all storage. Detect
    corruption early, log every preservation event to the standard, and
    summarize anomalies with AI so small teams can protect petabyte‑scale
    collections and pass audits with confidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, curated dataset of real‑world preservation anomalies and PREMIS
    event patterns across heterogeneous storage, enabling superior triage and
    low false positives; prebuilt, audited mappings to PREMIS 3.x and compliance
    frameworks; and trusted integrations with leading repository platforms that
    reduce institutional lift and procurement risk.

    Digital preservation leads at libraries and archives who must prove object
    integrity and compliance without adding staff burden.
  problem: >-
    Silent bit rot, drifting checksums, and fragmented PREMIS logging put
    collections, audits, and institutional trust at risk; teams lack time and
    uniform tooling across storage silos.

    Preservation technologists and archivists offering an AI monitor aligned
    with OAIS and PREMIS; security-first, read-only, and proven across cloud and
    on‑prem storage.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect read-only storage and repositories; 2) Set fixity frequency and
    PREMIS policies; 3) AI monitors, logs evidence-grade events, delivers
    concise anomaly summaries, and guides remediation.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30‑day pilot—connect one storage location in minutes; or request an
    audit-readiness report and risk baseline.
  success: >-
    Continuous, verifiable integrity; complete PREMIS event history; audit-ready

  problem:
    - Manual fixity audits don’t scale across silos and petabytes.
    - >-
      Missing or inconsistent PREMIS events risk compliance and
      chain-of-custody.
    - Silent bit rot and storage anomalies go undetected for months.
    - Noisy alerts waste staff time and delay true incident response.
    - Reporting is slow; auditors need defensible evidence now.
    - Legacy tools don’t cover modern cloud + on‑prem hybrid stacks.
  solution:
    - 'Continuous, policy-driven fixity checks across cloud and on‑prem storage.'
    - 'Standards-based PREMIS event creation, enrichment, and immutable storage.'
    - 'AI summaries that explain anomalies, probable causes, and next steps.'
    - 'Real-time alerts, dashboards, and audit-ready evidence in one place.'
    - 'Safe, read-only validation that won’t modify your content.'
    - Deploy as SaaS or on‑prem/air‑gapped with minimal overhead.
  features:
    - >-
      Connect S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi, Backblaze B2,
      NFS/SMB, SFTP, iRODS, and more.
    - >-
      Fixity algorithms: MD5, SHA‑1, SHA‑256, SHA‑512; per-collection policies
      and schedules.
    - >-
      Baseline hashing with full or sampled scans; delta detection for changed
      objects.
    - >-
      PREMIS 3.0-compliant events (agents, outcomes, environment) with
      JSON/METS/PREMIS export.
    - Immutable event store and evidence trails for audits and certification.
    - >-
      AI anomaly triage: clusters incidents, highlights root causes (e.g., clock
      skew, permissions, network errors, checksum mismatch).
    - 'Alerts via email, Slack, Teams, webhooks, or SNS; deduped and noise-aware.'
    - Cost-aware scanning controls to minimize cloud egress and API charges.
    - >-
      Role-based access, SSO (SAML/OIDC), audit logging, and least-privilege
      credentials.
    - >-
      Read-only connectors and throttle windows to avoid impacting backups and
      users.
    - Risk scoring and policy-based escalation to stakeholders.
    - >-
      Integrations with Archivematica, Preservica, ArchivesSpace, Islandora (via
      API/webhooks).
  steps:
    - Connect your storage locations and preservation systems.
    - Import existing checksums and PREMIS records (optional).
    - 'Define policies: algorithms, schedules, sampling, alert routes.'
    - Run a baseline; monitor continuously with real-time visibility.
