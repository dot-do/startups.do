  problem:
    - >-
      Wineries routinely miss block-level yield by 15–40%, causing tank capacity
      misallocations, overtime labor, and lost fruit or quality downgrades.
    - >-
      Forecasting is manual and inconsistent (cluster counts, berry weights,
      spreadsheets), leading to late and reactive harvest decisions.
    - >-
      Weather volatility (heat spikes, rain events, smoke) makes in-season yield
      adjustments difficult without data-driven models.
    - >-
      Contract management suffers when actual delivered tonnage deviates from
      contracted tonnage, triggering penalties or last-minute grape purchases at
      unfavorable prices.
    - >-
      Operations teams lack a shared, timely forecast that integrates with
      winery ERP and vineyard work orders, creating communication gaps between
      vineyard, cellar, and finance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest historical block-level yields and phenology; fuse with
      high-resolution weather (GDD, chill hours, ET, heat events) and
      vine-balance proxies (satellite NDVI/EVI, canopy vigor, pruning weights,
      shoot counts).
    - >-
      Generate rolling weekly forecasts per block with 90/75/50% prediction
      intervals; highlight variance drivers (e.g., heat stress, set percentage,
      cluster weights).
    - >-
      Provide scenario planning (what-if heat spike, rainfall, smoke-related
      harvest pulls) and their impacts on tonnage and harvest windows.
    - >-
      Integrations to winery ERPs (e.g., vintrace, InnoVint), vineyard
      management (AgCode), and BI tools; API for custom data pipelines.
    - >-
      Sampling optimizer that prescribes minimal field counts needed to tighten
      confidence intervals per block.
    - >-
      Harvest logistics view: predicted pick dates and daily tonnage by
      block/variety/site for tank and labor scheduling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Block-level, explainable yield forecasts with confidence intervals 2–16
    weeks before harvest that reduce error by 30–50% versus manual methods,
    enabling precise harvest scheduling, tank and labor planning, and contract
    reconciliation—integrated directly into winery ERPs and vineyard tasking
    tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, anonymized, region-diverse dataset of block-level yields linked
    to vine vigor and weather that compounds accuracy over time; integrated
    onboarding playbooks and ERP connectors reduce switching costs; explainable
    models tailored to viticulture build trust beyond generic ag-tech analytics.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Vineyard, winemaking, and operations leaders at wineries (NAICS 312130) who
    need dependable block-level yield forecasts to plan labor, harvest dates,
    tank capacity, grower contracts, and sales.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather swings, vine balance variability, and siloed field data
    make block-level yields hard to predict; manual estimates are late and
    inconsistent.

    Internal: Teams feel blind and overstretched, forced to gamble on labor,
    crusher schedules, and contracts.

    Philosophical: In a data-rich era, wineries shouldn’t have to guess—every
    block deserves a quantified forecast.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We work closely with vineyard teams and understand the stress of
    crop calls, sudden pick changes, and capacity crunches.

    Authority: Built by viticulture and ML practitioners using historical
    yields, hyperlocal weather, and vine-balance proxies (e.g., NDVI/canopy
    vigor, pruning weights, shoot counts). Validated with backtesting and
    holdout seasons; integrates cleanly with existing data flows.
  plan: >-
    1) Onboard: Ingest historical yields, block maps, weather feeds, and
    vine-balance proxies; clean and align data.

    2) Model: Train block-level models; produce short- and mid-term forecasts
    with confidence intervals; update weekly as conditions evolve.

    3) Operationalize: Deliver dashboards and alerts; export to CSV/BI tools;
    review forecasts in a monthly check-in. Clear SLA, secure data handling, and
    you retain data ownership.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day pilot on 3–5
    representative blocks.

    Transitional: Download a sample block forecast and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Reliable block-level yield predictions weeks to months ahead; confident
    harvest and labor planning; optimized tank and truck utilization; fewer
    last-minute picks; smarter grower contracting; tighter alignment between
    vineyard, cellar, and sales; improved margins and cash-flow visibility.
  failure: >-
    Continued guesswork leading to over/under-picks, overtime and trucking
    scrambles, fruit loss or quality hits, missed allocations, strained grower
    relationships, and eroded margins.
