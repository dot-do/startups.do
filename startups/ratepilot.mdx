  problem:
    - >-
      Banks and credit unions struggle to hit funding targets without eroding
      net interest margin (NIM), especially during rate volatility.
    - >-
      Promotions often cannibalize existing balances (internal transfers)
      instead of attracting net-new or at‑risk balances, but cannibalization is
      rarely quantified beforehand.
    - >-
      Pricing decisions are made with manual spreadsheets, limited elasticity
      estimation, and delayed competitive intel—leading to slow, reactive
      pricing cycles.
    - >-
      Executives lack a multi-objective optimization framework that
      simultaneously targets funding needs, NIM preservation, and customer
      retention by segment/channel/market.
    - >-
      Poor measurement and governance expose institutions to model risk and
      regulatory scrutiny (SR 11‑7/Occ guidance), slowing adoption of advanced
      analytics in pricing.
    - >-
      Siloed systems (core, digital banking, CRM, ALM/FTP) make it hard to
      execute and measure pricing experiments at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-objective pricing optimization that balances funding target
      attainment, NIM impact, and cannibalization risk at product/segment/market
      levels.
    - >-
      Elasticity modeling per product (savings, MMDA, CDs by term), channel
      (branch, digital, brokered), and segment (balance bands, tenure,
      geography).
    - >-
      Cannibalization and attrition forecasting that attributes new high-rate
      balances to internal transfers vs net-new vs retained at‑risk funds.
    - >-
      Automated competitive rate monitoring across peer sets with alerts and
      scenario analysis tied to Fed path and yield curves.
    - >-
      Closed-loop A/B testing and offer execution via integrations with core and
      digital banking, with guardrails for compliance and profitability.
    - >-
      Regulatory-grade model documentation (SR 11‑7), explainability, and
      governance dashboards for model risk management.
    - >-
      Quick start with historical core data ingestion, baseline model
      calibration, and an 8–12 week pilot delivering measurable lift.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit funding targets with precision while protecting NIM: AI-driven deposit
    pricing that predicts cannibalization, quantifies elasticity by segment, and
    recommends rate actions you can explain to regulators and execute in days,
    not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Privacy-preserving, cross-institution learning of deposit elasticity and
    cannibalization that improves recommendations without sharing PII; combined
    with explainable, regulatory-ready models and prebuilt core/digital
    connectors enabling measurable results in the first 8–12 weeks.

  character: >-
    Deposit-raising leaders at banks, credit unions, and other depository
    institutions (CFO, Treasurer, ALM, Deposit Product) who need to hit funding
    targets, protect NIM, and avoid cannibalization.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile rates, aggressive competitor promos, and deposit runoff
    create funding gaps.

    Internal: Manual, slow pricing cycles; uncertainty about elasticity; fear of
    cannibalizing existing balances and crushing NIM; ALCO pressure.

    Philosophical: Pricing should be data-driven, explainable, and fair—not
    guesswork or blanket rate hikes.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve sat in ALCO and pricing meetings; every basis point and
    relationship matters.

    Authority: Built by former bank ALM/pricing leaders and data scientists;
    explainable models, historical backtesting, and bank-grade
    security/governance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Securely integrate core deposit history, competitor rates, and
    funding/NIM goals.

    2) Calibrate: Estimate segment-level elasticity/attrition; simulate
    cannibalization and cost of funds.

    3) Act & govern: Recommend optimal savings/CD rates with guardrails,
    approvals, and audit trail; monitor actuals and iteratively refine.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo and launch a 60-day pilot on one
    product/region.

    Transitional: Request a free elasticity snapshot and NIM impact estimate
    using our anonymized data template.
  success: >-
    Meet funding targets at the lowest total cost; protect or expand NIM;
    minimize cannibalization; faster, confident pricing cycles; clear ALCO/board
    narratives; fair, consistent pricing with audit-ready governance; stronger
    deposit franchise.
  failure: >-
    Overpay for deposits; erode NIM; cannibalize existing balances; lose loyal
    customers to rate whiplash; inconsistent pricing scrutiny; missed growth and
    weakened franchise value.
