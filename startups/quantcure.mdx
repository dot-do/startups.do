  problem:
    - >-
      QC failures are detected late (post-curing or post-shipment), causing
      scrap/rework, rush remakes, and credits; typical plants report 1–3% lot
      nonconformance annually.
    - >-
      Manual SPC in spreadsheets is slow and error-prone; test entry latency
      (hours–days) masks process drifts (moisture variation, batch water,
      vibration/press settings, curing temperature/humidity).
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is difficult across siloed systems (batching PLCs,
      moisture sensors, curing controllers, compression testing machines, LIMS).
    - >-
      Regulatory/standards compliance (ASTM C90/C140; NCMA certification)
      requires audit trails that are tedious to assemble; data integrity risks
      exist.
    - >-
      Operator and shift variability leads to inconsistent quality
      (over/under-vibration, mixer time), yet there is no early-warning system
      with actionable thresholds.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data pipeline: connectors to batching (cement, water/cement ratio,
      moisture, admixtures), block machine (vibration frequency/amps,
      tamper/head pressure, cycle time), curing (temp/humidity/steam/CO2, time),
      and lab (compressive strength, absorption, dimensions, density) via OPC
      UA/Modbus/API.
    - >-
      Real-time SPC: X̄–R, EWMA, and CUSUM charts with Western Electric/Nelson
      rules; dynamic control limits by mix design, mold, and line; automated
      alarms (SMS/Email/Mobile).
    - >-
      Predictive risk scoring: supervised models predict probability of failing
      C90 strength or C140 absorption/dimensions before the lot is released;
      SHAP-based contributors flag likely causes (e.g., low mixer time + high
      aggregate moisture).
    - >-
      Actionable workflows: hold/release gates, corrective action suggestions
      (e.g., adjust batch water by +3–5 L/m³, increase vibration +5%), and
      e-sign approvals; integrates with existing hold ticket processes.
    - >-
      Traceability and genealogy: link material lots (cement/aggregate), molds,
      shifts, and operators to finished pallets/loads; one-click audit package
      for NCMA/ASTM inspections.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement: weekly Pareto of top defect drivers, golden-batch
      benchmarking by product/mold, and ROI tracking of interventions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prevent out-of-spec CMU and concrete brick before it ships. QuantCure
    unifies plant data, applies SPC and AI to predict ASTM C90/C140 failures
    2–24 hours earlier, and guides corrective actions—cutting scrap/rework
    30–50%, stabilizing strength/absorption/dimensions, and delivering
    audit-ready compliance with minimal operator friction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, cross-plant labeled dataset tying batching/machine/curing
    signatures to ASTM C90/C140 failures, combined with OEM-level integrations
    that reduce time-to-value to weeks—not months—and audit-ready compliance
    packages tailored to CMU certification requirements.

  character: >-
    Plant and quality managers at concrete block and brick manufacturers (NAICS
    327331) who need predictable quality, on-time shipments, and audit-ready
    SPC.
  problem: >-
    External: Raw material variability and curing drift cause off-spec strength,
    absorption, and dimensions; SPC is manual/reactive; lab results lag and data
    is siloed. Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting and worried about surprise
    failures. Philosophical: Quality issues should be prevented in-process, not
    discovered after the kiln or at the lab.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand how hard it is to spot slow drifts before they create
    reject runs. Authority: Our AI learns your plant’s normal, monitors process
    and lab data end-to-end, and flags anomalies against ASTM targets;
    integrations with mixers, curing/kiln sensors, scales, and LIMS; references
    and pilot results available.
  plan: >-
    3 steps: 1) Connect data (mixers, kiln/curing sensors, scales, LIMS/ERP). 2)
    Calibrate with historical and live batches to set dynamic SPC limits. 3)
    Run: real-time anomaly detection and alerts with operator playbooks, plus
    weekly Pareto and root-cause reports. Low-risk pilot, secure data, keep your
    existing SPC.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and data readiness review. Transitional: Get
    the alert playbook and ROI calculator; start a single-line pilot.
  success: >-
    Proactively catch at-risk batches; fewer rejects and rework; stable
    strength/absorption/dimensions; confident ASTM compliance; faster corrective
    actions; lower cement and energy waste; on-time shipments; audit-ready SPC
    and traceability.
  failure: >-
    Without action, hidden drifts become failed tests, scrap, rework, late
    shipments, warranty claims, wasted materials/energy, stressed teams, and
    lost customer trust.
