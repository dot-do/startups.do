  problem:
    - >-
      Site preparation contractors struggle to convert frequent drone/topo
      captures into defensible, owner-accepted pay quantities and as-built
      surfaces on tight timelines.
    - >-
      Manual CAD/survey workflows are slow (1–3 days/scan), error-prone, and
      vary by technician, leading to disputes, delayed pay apps, and cash flow
      gaps.
    - >-
      Owners require audit-ready deliverables that meet spec (ground control
      accuracy, metadata, residuals) and align with design bid items—most drone
      platforms stop at maps, not pay quantities.
    - >-
      Inconsistent volume variance (+/- 5–15%) versus certified survey exposes
      contractors to margin erosion and back charges.
    - >-
      Operational teams need weekly progress visibility (cut/fill by area, haul
      plans, stockpile tracking) but lack standardized, automated reporting and
      integrations to current tools.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turn raw drone/topo inputs (photos, point clouds, GNSS/topo shots) into
      validated surfaces (TIN/LandXML/DWG) and itemized pay quantities within 24
      hours.
    - >-
      AI-driven surface reconstruction and breakline detection with uncertainty
      estimates, calibrated to ground control/known checkpoints.
    - >-
      Automated progress volumes by phase/area and by bid item (e.g.,
      unclassified excavation, undercut, import/export, topsoil strip/replace,
      trench/backfill).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop survey QC and optional PLS-stamped deliverables to meet
      owner or DOT spec, complete with QA/QC report and chain-of-custody.
    - >-
      APIs and exports to estimation/field systems; change detection alerts,
      issue tracking, and acceptance workflows with role-based sign-off.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-validated as-built surfaces and pay quantities you can take to the
    bank—owner-ready, spec-compliant, and delivered within 24 hours, with
    accuracy and audit trail guaranteed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Audit-grade deliverables with quantified uncertainty and PLS-backed
    acceptance, trained on one of the largest labeled datasets of earthwork pay
    items and as-built surfaces; integrated chain-of-custody and owner approval
    workflows reduce disputes and accelerate cash flow, making switching costly
    once embedded in pay app processes.
