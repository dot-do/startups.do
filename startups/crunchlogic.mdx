leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High out-of-stock rates (typical 6–12%) at retailer DCs/stores under VMI,
      causing lost sales and retailer penalties.
    - >-
      Excess and aged inventory from naive order rules leads to 0.8–2.0%
      unsaleables/write-offs due to expired or near-expiry product.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-driven VMI planning cannot account for lead-time
      variability, promotions, and shelf-life constraints simultaneously at
      SKU-account scale.
    - >-
      Retailers impose minimum remaining shelf-life (MRSL) and OTIF policies;
      poor adherence drives fines, returns, and relationship risk.
    - >-
      Limited visibility and weak forecasting of promo and seasonal lifts in
      snacks (can be 1.5–3.0x base), causing either stockouts or overstocks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily AI-driven order recommendations per SKU-account (and optionally per
      DC/store for DSD) that hit service-level targets (e.g., 98–99.5%) while
      respecting MRSL and case-pack/truck constraints.
    - >-
      Probabilistic demand forecasting that blends POS, shipments, promotions,
      seasonality, events, and price changes; automatically learns
      retailer-specific patterns.
    - >-
      Shelf-life and freshness optimization: enforces minimum remaining shelf
      life at arrival, allocates freshest lots to longer-lead accounts, and
      minimizes aging risk in the network.
    - >-
      Lead-time aware multi-echelon logic (plant → mfg DC → retailer DC →
      store/DSD) that absorbs variability and proposes safety stocks to meet
      target CSL at least cost.
    - >-
      “Human-in-the-loop” workflows: exception queues, what-if scenarios, and
      one-click EDI/order portal submission with audit trails.
    - >-
      90-day pilot methodology: establish baseline KPIs, run shadow mode, then
      controlled rollout with A/B measurement and performance guarantees.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Shelf-life aware, retailer-policy compliant VMI ordering that increases
    on-shelf availability by 2–5 points and cuts stales/unsaleables 15–35%, with
    daily, prescriptive order quantities per retailer account and fast
    time-to-value (live in 6–8 weeks).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built, shelf-life aware VMI optimizer for snack categories with
    preconfigured retailer templates and connectors, plus a growing anonymized
    benchmark dataset that improves forecasts and policy tuning over time;
    offered with performance-backed pilots that de-risk adoption.
