  problem:
    - >-
      Escalating herbicide resistance in key cotton weeds (e.g., Palmer
      amaranth, kochia, ryegrass) increases control costs and risk of crop loss.
    - >-
      Growers often lack timely, spatially precise weed maps, leading to blanket
      sprays, higher chemical costs, and resistance pressure.
    - >-
      Optimal spray windows are narrow and complex: label constraints (wind,
      temp inversions, buffers), weather forecasts (rain, delta T), crop stage,
      and sensitive crops nearby.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: misapplication can trigger fines, crop damage, and
      neighbor conflict; documentation is fragmented or manual.
    - >-
      Operational inefficiency: scouting is labor-intensive and inconsistent;
      drone imagery is underutilized due to lack of specialized weed analytics
      for cotton.
    - >-
      Lack of actionable, field-ready outputs (variable-rate prescriptions,
      advisories) that integrate with existing sprayers and farm management
      platforms.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest drone and smartphone images; auto-stitch or align to field
      boundaries; detect weeds by species and growth stage; output georeferenced
      density maps.
    - >-
      Combine forecast and on-field conditions to compute label-compliant spray
      windows (wind, inversion risk, temperature/humidity/delta T, rainfall
      wash-off, buffer zones, PHI/REI).
    - >-
      Generate variable-rate prescription files to target hotspots while
      avoiding clean areas; support ISOXML, shapefile, and major controller
      formats.
    - >-
      Send proactive notifications for upcoming/high-confidence spray windows;
      provide confidence scores and alternative windows.
    - >-
      Provide an auditable compliance trail (what/where/when/why), including
      label rules applied and weather snapshots.
    - >-
      Offer an ROI dashboard estimating chemical saved, acres avoided, and
      resistance pressure trends over time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cotton-specific AI that converts drone/phone imagery into species-level weed
    heatmaps and delivers label-aware, weather-smart spray windows with
    exportable prescriptions—cutting chemical costs, reducing resistance
    pressure, and de-risking compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cotton-first dataset and label-aware decision engine tuned to real-world
    constraints, validated with extension trials, and embedded in sprayer/FMS

  character: >-
    Cotton growers and agronomists who want clean fields, higher yield, and
    on‑label applications without wasted passes.
  problem: >-
    External: Patchy, fast‑emerging weeds, narrow weather‑dependent spray
    windows, complex labels. Internal: Stress and guesswork on when and how to
    spray. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to gamble yield, safety, or
    compliance to control weeds.
  guide: >-
    We combine agronomy, weather, and computer vision to turn imagery into
    decisions. Field‑validated weed detection for cotton, label‑aware timing,
    and clear, accountable recommendations—built for real‑world spraying and
    recordkeeping.
  plan: >-
    1) Capture fields with a drone or phone and upload. 2) Get weed maps with
    priority zones plus a 7‑day spray window using wind/temp/inversion/rain
    forecasts and label cutoffs, with nozzle/mix guidance. 3) Execute, sync with
    your sprayer/contractor, and auto‑log compliance.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free pilot on one field today. Transitional: Book a
    15‑minute walkthrough and preview sample maps and spray‑window alerts.
  success: >-
    Hit the right window the first time; higher control with fewer passes;
    reduced drift and waste; on‑label, auditable records; cleaner rows, stronger
    early growth, more lint per acre, and peace of mind.
  failure: >-
    Missed windows, resprays, drift complaints and fines, wasted chemical,
    early‑season yield loss, and accelerating resistance across your farm.

  problem:
    - Patchy weed outbreaks drive blanket sprays and wasted chem.
    - 'Missed spray windows due to wind, heat, or inversions.'
