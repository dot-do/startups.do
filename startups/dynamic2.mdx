leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Margin leakage from blanket markdowns and one-size-fits-all promotions
      that erode profit without reliably boosting sell-through
    - >-
      Fear of violating MAP causes over-conservative pricing or missed promo
      opportunities; manual MAP monitoring is error-prone
    - >-
      Pricing and promo decisions are spreadsheet-driven, slow, and lack
      statistically valid tests; results are hard to attribute
    - >-
      Inventory aging and stockouts due to poor timing/depth of markdowns;
      limited visibility into SKU-level elasticity
    - >-
      Omnichannel inconsistencies (web, store, marketplace) create channel
      conflict and brand risk
    - >-
      Complexity pricing sets/bundles (3-piece luggage sets, gift bundles) and
      managing cannibalization/halo effects
    - >-
      Insufficient use of external signals (travel seasonality, competitor
      prices) to anticipate demand and price sensitivity
    - >-
      Promotional calendars planned on gut-feel; limited measurement of promo
      ROI, lifetime value impact, and discount dependency
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click connectors to ecommerce/POS/ERP (Shopify Plus, SFCC,
      BigCommerce, Magento, NetSuite, Retail Pro, Lightspeed) to ingest orders,
      inventory, costs, and MAP policies
    - >-
      Category-specific product taxonomy (size, material, wheels, hard/soft, set
      vs single, colorways) and attribute graph to enable cold-start modeling
    - >-
      Causal demand and cross-elasticity models refreshed weekly; price
      floors/ceilings auto-derived from MAP/MSRP and brand/channel guardrails
    - >-
      Experimentation engine (geo/store A/B, multi-armed bandits) with holdouts
      and lift measurement; promo cannibalization/halo estimation
    - >-
      Promo calendar optimizer to recommend offer type, depth, duration, and
      audience; simulates impact on margin, sell-through, and inventory aging
    - >-
      Auto-deploy prices/promos via APIs with role-based approvals, audits,
      rollback, and omnichannel synchronization
    - >-
      Competitor price index and MAP monitoring with real-time alerts and
      automated evidence logs for brand audits
    - >-
      Markdown optimizer for aging SKUs and end-of-season clearance to maximize
      GMROI vs. sell-through targets
    - >-
      Analytics suite: incremental gross margin dollars, GMROI, sell-through,
      discount dependency, stockout risk; scenario planning and what-if
      simulations
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase gross margin 3–8% and sell-through 10–20% within 90 days—while
    maintaining zero MAP violations—through MAP-aware price testing and
    promotion optimization purpose-built for luggage and leather goods.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, MAP-aware optimization engine calibrated to luggage and
    leather goods (sets/bundles, travel seasonality, brand guardrails), with
    prebuilt connectors and a compliance-first workflow. Fast 90-day pilots
    demonstrating 4–7% gross margin lift with zero MAP breaches create brand
    trust and proof of value that generalist pricing tools struggle to match.

    specialty retail—combining demand modeling with audit-ready MAP and brand
    guardrails.

    Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a low-risk 6-week pilot to prove lift in
    a priority category.
  success: >-
    Confident, compliant pricing; higher gross margin and sell-through; fewer
    blanket markdowns; faster inventory turns with transparent, test-backed ROI.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing margin leakage, over-discounting, MAP violations, slow sell-through,
