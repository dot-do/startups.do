  problem:
    - >-
      High scrap and rework due to out-of-spec tortilla diameter, roundness,
      blistering, and burn spots (typical 1–3% yield loss)
    - >-
      Manual QC is intermittent and subjective, missing transient process drift
      and causing inconsistent quality across shifts and plants
    - >-
      Lack of real-time, closed-loop feedback from inspection to operators/PLCs
      prolongs time-to-correct when press, oven, or moisture settings drift
    - >-
      Retail and QSR customers enforce strict specs; chargebacks and claims
      occur due to inconsistent visual quality and foldability issues
    - >-
      Existing generic vision systems require heavy custom engineering and are
      not tuned for tortilla-specific defects or high-throughput bakery
      environments
  solution:
    - >-
      Ruggedized camera + lighting kit over the conveyor with automatic
      calibration and sanitation-friendly enclosures (IP65)
    - >-
      Edge AI appliance deployed on-prem to score every tortilla in under 200 ms
      and push actionable alerts to operators and PLCs

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    QA managers and plant leaders at tortilla plants who want consistent,
    spec-perfect tortillas at scale with fewer rejects and less manual
    inspection.
  problem: >-
    Manual sampling is slow and subjective, causing missed defects. Diameter,
    roundness, blisters, burn or char, and foldability vary by shift, leading to
    scrap, chargebacks, and complaints.
  guide: >-
    Vision QC combines food manufacturing know-how with production-ready
    computer vision trained on live line images to score diameter, roundness,
    blistering, burn or char, and foldability proxies—backed by successful
    pilots and clear ROI.
  plan: >-
    1) Quick line study and pilot with existing or low-cost cameras. 2)
    Calibrate thresholds to your specs and integrate alerts and dashboards. 3)
    Go live on one line, then scale plant-wide with training and support.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a line assessment. Transitional: Request a sample scorecard
    from your line images.
  success: >-
    Spec adherence for size and shape, early detection of blisters and burn,
    validated foldability proxies, higher first-pass yield, less scrap and
    rework, fewer retailer complaints, audit-ready objective scorecards, and
    confident operators.
  failure: >-
    Rely on subjective checks, let defects reach customers, waste labor and
    materials on rework, miss audits, slow throughput, damage your brand, and
    risk lost contracts.

  problem:
    - Inconsistent diameter/shape drives rejects and chargebacks.
    - 'Manual checks are slow, subjective, and miss transient defects.'
    - Blistering and burn variability erodes brand consistency.
    - Limited QC data means no per-unit traceability or trend visibility.
    - Scaling output requires more inspectors and training time.
    - 'Retailer and audit requirements demand documented, defensible QC.'
  solution:
    - 'Automated, objective scoring for every tortilla at line speed.'
    - >-
      Per-unit metrics: diameter, roundness, blister coverage/intensity,
      burn/char, foldability proxies.
    - Real-time pass/fail with alarms and feedback to operators/PLCs.
    - SKU-specific tolerances and instant changeovers.
    - 'Dashboards, batch reports, and API/CSV exports for audits and CI.'
    - Deploy on edge or cloud; works with existing camera setups.
  features:
    - High-precision diameter and roundness measurement.
    - Blister and burn detection with heat-map visualization.
    - Foldability proxy from surface texture and color cues.
    - Auto-calibration; robust to lighting and conveyor variation.
    - Low-latency scoring for high-throughput lines.
    - 'Role-based access, audit logs, and retention policies.'
    - 'Multi-line, multi-plant rollups with OEE/QC KPIs.'
    - 'Flexible integration: REST API, OPC UA/PLC tags, MQTT, webhooks.'
    - 'Optimized for flour, corn, and whole wheat tortillas.'
    - On-prem (including air-gapped) or secure cloud; privacy by design.
  steps:
    - Share sample images/video and your spec ranges.
    - We validate fit and configure a pilot on your line.
    - Install edge appliance or connect to existing cameras.
    - Set thresholds and verify against a golden batch.
    - 'Go live with real-time scoring, alerts, and dashboards.'
    - Scale to additional lines/SKUs using templates and APIs.
