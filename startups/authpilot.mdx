leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual PA intake across ePA/fax/portal is fragmented, requiring 12–20
      minutes of tech/pharmacist time per case and creating backlogs, overtime,
      and SLA risks.
    - >-
      Clinical context is scattered across PDFs, C-CDA attachments, and free
      text; extracting and aligning it to plan-specific criteria is error-prone
      and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Turnaround times and letter compliance (CMS/state) are hard to meet at
      scale, leading to provider abrasion, appeal rates of 10–20% on denials,
      and regulatory exposure.
    - >-
      Existing ePA tools digitize submission but do not reduce payer-side review
      effort enough; rules engines struggle with nuanced policy language,
      exceptions, and supporting evidence.
    - >-
      PBMs/TPAs lack transparent, auditable reasoning for decisions; QA sampling
      is manual and misses drift in criteria, new drugs (e.g., GLP-1s), and
      state-mandated wording changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel intake: normalize ePA (NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071), portal exports,
      fax/PDF into a unified case.
    - >-
      Document AI: classify, OCR, and parse clinical attachments (C-CDA, labs,
      progress notes) to structured facts (diagnosis, prior therapies, labs,
      BMI, prescriber specialty).
    - >-
      Criteria engine: map extracted facts to plan-specific drug policies and
      step therapy, with state/CMS overlays.
    - >-
      Draft decision support: generate a recommended approve/deny/pend rationale
      with citations to policy sections and detected evidence gaps.
    - >-
      Letter automation: draft provider/patient letters using plan templates and
      jurisdiction-required language; pre-populate denial reason codes and
      alternatives.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop UI: pharmacist console to review/override with one-click
      edits; full audit trail and versioning.
    - >-
      Integrations: bi-directional with UM platforms (Jiva, GuidingCare,
      TruCare, Pegasystems, Altruista), ePA networks (Surescripts, CoverMyMeds),
      and fax APIs.
    - >-
      Safety/compliance: deterministic guardrails, redaction, PII/PHI handling,
      model monitoring, SOC 2 + HITRUST.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce PA handling time by 50–70% with auditable AI that ingests any
    channel, assembles clinical context, maps to policy criteria, and drafts a
    decision + compliant letters for pharmacist sign-off—improving turnaround,
    lowering cost per case, and reducing appeals without changing core UM
    platforms.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of payer-specific PA decisions linked to exact
    policy sections and reviewer edits enables high-accuracy drafting with
    auditable citations; deep integrations into dominant UM platforms and ePA
    networks reduce switching friction; and a compliance-first approach (SOC
    2/HITRUST, CMS/state letter libraries) de-risks procurement and audits.

    PBM and TPA pharmacy operations leaders who need faster, consistent,
    compliant prior authorization decisions without growing headcount.
  problem: >-
    PAs arrive via ePA, fax, and portals; clinicians chase missing clinicals;
    criteria are applied inconsistently; letters take too long; backlogs delay
    therapy, drive costs, and invite compliance risk.

    decision support assembles context, matches plan criteria, and drafts
    decisions and letters you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest ePA, fax (OCR), and portal submissions. 2) Configure: Map
    plan criteria and letter templates. 3) Automate: Assemble clinical context
    and draft recommended determinations and letters. 4) Review: Pharmacist
    validates and finalizes in your workflow. 5) Prove and scale: Pilot, measure
    turnaround and quality, then roll out.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a no‑risk pilot.
  success: >-
    Same‑day decisions, lower admin cost per PA, consistent and auditable
    determinations, faster therapy starts, happier providers and members, and
    scalable compliance-ready workflows.
  failure: >-
    Manual rework and backlogs persist, turnarounds slip, appeals and compliance
    findings increase, provider abrasion grows, costs rise, and members wait
    longer for therapy.
