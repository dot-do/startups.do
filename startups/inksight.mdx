  risks:
    - Bullwhip from volatile orders
    - Supplier constraints not captured
    - Incorrect BOM/yield assumptions
  dependencies:
    - 'ERP data (orders, inventory)'
    - Formulation BOMs
    - Supplier master data
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile pigment/resin/solvent lead times (8–26+ weeks) and supplier
      MOQs/price breaks make manual planning error-prone, causing stockouts and
      late orders.
    - >-
      Current planning is spreadsheet-based, disconnected from ERP/formulations;
      BOM explosions and yield losses are handled manually, creating forecast
      bias and delays.
    - >-
      Working capital is tied up: excess/slow-moving RM inventory and
      obsolescence from reformulations and customer churn.
    - Frequent expedite freight and premium buys inflate COGS and erode margins.
    - >-
      Price breaks and MOQs are not systematically optimized, leaving 2–5%
      savings on the table per PO.
    - >-
      Shelf-life, hazard classes, and storage constraints are not embedded in
      planning, increasing compliance risks and write-offs.
    - >-
      Order pipeline changes (quote-to-order conversion, reschedules) are not
      reflected in RM plans fast enough, hurting OTIF.
    - >-
      Supplier performance variability (fill rate, quality, on-time) isn’t
      modeled into lead-time buffers or safety stock dynamically.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest live demand (orders/quotes/forecasts) and explode formulations/BOMs
      with yield, scrap, and batch-size factors to compute time-phased RM
      requirements.
    - >-
      Predict near-term demand and RM usage with hierarchical models
      (SKU-family, customer, plant) and automatically adjust for promotions,
      seasonality, and customer churn.
    - >-
      Optimize PO plans that respect MOQs, supplier lead times, price breaks,
      delivery calendars, and storage constraints to minimize total landed cost
      and stockout risk.
    - >-
      Provide scenario planning: simulate supplier delays, price changes,
      reformulations, and demand shocks with side-by-side cost/service impacts.
    - >-
      Surface dynamic safety stocks and reorder points using service-level
      targets, supplier variability, and shelf-life constraints.
    - >-
      Generate auditable PO recommendations and changes (split orders, bring-in
      dates, vendor substitutions), pushable to ERP with approval workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Formulation-aware AI that converts your live order pipeline into precise
    raw-material plans and purchase orders, optimizing MOQs, lead times, and
    price breaks. Achieve 15–25% less RM working capital, 30–50% fewer
    stockouts, and 20–40% fewer expedites within 8–12 weeks, with auditable,
    ERP-ready recommendations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized, formulation-aware planning that embeds shelf-life and
    hazardous storage constraints, combined with an optimizer tuned for MOQ and
    price-break economics in chemicals. Over time, network effects from
    aggregated supplier performance and pricing patterns improve recommendations
    beyond what generic APS/IBP tools deliver, with explainability and ERP-ready
    workflows purpose-built for ink manufacturers.
