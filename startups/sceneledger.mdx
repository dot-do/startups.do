  title: Script Breakdown + Budget Pre-Estimator
  description: >-
    Auto-extract scenes, characters, locations, props, stunts, and VFX from a
    script; draft line-item budget and assumptions sheet.
  targetUsers:
    - Producers
    - Line Producers
    - UPMs
  triggers:
    - New script (FDX/PDF) uploaded
    - Greenlight/prep kickoff
  inputs:
    - Script (FDX/PDF)
    - Union/non-union rules and rates
    - Department rate cards
    - Shooting ratio and schedule assumptions
  steps:
    - >-
      Parse script; identify scenes, INT/EXT, day/night, characters, props,
      SFX/VFX, SFX/vehicles/animals
    - Group by location and estimate company moves
    - Estimate pages-per-day and shoot days by complexity
    - >-
      Generate preliminary budget lines (labor, rentals, locations, post) using
      provided rates
    - 'Flag cost/risk hotspots (e.g., minors, stunts, FX, nights)'
    - >-
      Export breakdown sheets, budget, and assumption log; route for producer
      review
  tools:
    - OpenAI GPT-4o
    - Final Draft FDX parser
    - Pandas/Excel
    - Airtable/Notion export
  outputs:
    - Breakdown sheets (CSV/XLSX)
    - Preliminary budget (XLSX)
    - Assumptions & risk memo (PDF)
    - Location summary and company-move count
  pricingModel:
    - Per script page (tiered)

  risks:
    - Misinterpreting stunts/VFX scope
    - Incorrect union rule application
    - Hallucinated counts if script formatting is poor
  dependencies:
    - Accurate rate cards and rules
    - Cleanly formatted script
    - 'Producer’s assumptions (shoot ratio, working hours)'
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Script breakdown and budgeting are slow and manual (typically 20–60 hours
      per feature; 4–12 hours per episode/commercial), delaying greenlights and
      bids.
    - >-
      Budgets are inconsistent across versions and teams; assumptions are poorly
      tracked, causing 10–20% overages and schedule slippage.
    - >-
      Producers lack a fast, defensible first-pass budget to compare scenarios
      (locations, union vs non-union, tax incentives) early in development.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either manual-first or siloed; they don’t integrate AI
      extraction, union/guild rates, tax incentives, and rate cards into a
      single workflow.
    - >-
      Indie producers and small agencies lack access to experienced line
      producers early; they need guidance and templates to avoid costly
      mistakes.
    - >-
      Studios/streamers need standardized, auditable breakdowns and budgets that
      integrate with their existing systems (Movie Magic, EP, SAP/NetSuite).
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload script (PDF/FDX/ Fountain) and select project type/region/union
      status; AI extracts scenes, characters, locations, props, stunts, SFX/VFX,
      vehicles, animals, music cues, special equipment.
    - >-
      Generate a first-pass line-item budget using curated templates by
      format/genre; auto-apply union/guild minimums, fringes, overtime, kit
      rentals, overheads, and contingency.
    - >-
      Create an assumptions sheet and risk log auto-linked to line items (shoot
      days, pages/day, crew size, gear package tier, build vs buy/ rent, company
      moves).
    - >-
      Scenario planner to compare locations/incentives, union vs non-union, set
      vs location build, day vs night splits; output deltas and ROI on
      incentives.
    - >-
      Version control and diffs: track changes between script revisions and
      budgets; export to Movie Magic, EP SmartAccounting, StudioBinder, or
      CSV/Excel.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option for mission-critical bids (rapid turnaround
      panel of vetted line producers).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, audit-ready script breakdown and budget pre-estimate in under 30
    minutes—integrating AI extraction, union/guild rates, tax incentives, and
    rate cards—so producers can move from script to defensible budget 10x faster
    and with measurable accuracy.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, rights-cleared corpus linking scripts → breakdowns →
    actualized budgets with outcome data (overages, incentive capture), enabling
    uniquely accurate estimates; combined with union/incentive rule engines,
    enterprise-grade integrations, and a vetted reviewer network that
    competitors lack.

    Producers, line producers, and UPMs who need fast, accurate breakdowns and
    early budgets from a script.
  problem: >-
    Manual breakdowns take days, miss elements, and delay bids—making approvals
    risky and prep expensive.
  guide: >-
    We get the pressure of prep. Our AI is trained on real-world scripts and
    budgets to surface every element and justify the numbers.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload your script. 2) Review auto-extracted scenes, characters,
    locations, props, stunts, and VFX with an assumptions sheet. 3) Export
    line-item budget and reports to Movie Magic or Excel.
  callToAction: Start your free breakdown and pre-estimate now.
  success: >-
    Defensible budgets in hours, aligned assumptions, tighter bids, faster
    greenlights, and fewer costly surprises on set.
  failure: >-
    Guessing costs, missing elements, blown bids, budget overruns, and lost
    financing.
