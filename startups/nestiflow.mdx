  problem:
    - >-
      Material waste: typical sheet/tube utilization in office metal furniture
      is 78–88%; 3–7% scrap reduction is routinely possible with better nesting
      and remnant reuse.
    - >-
      Programming bottlenecks: 1–3 hours/day per programmer spent cleaning
      DXF/DWG/STEP, deduping parts, setting grain constraints, and creating
      cutlists; delays cause missed ship dates.
    - >-
      Inconsistent NC quality: manual lead-in/out, pierce point and micro-tab
      placement lead to heat distortion, rework, and extra deburring (0.5–1.5%
      yield loss).
    - >-
      Poor remnant management: offcut tracking is manual/inaccurate; remnants
      over-accumulate or get scrapped, raising material cost 1–3%.
    - >-
      Multi-order nesting/scheduling gaps: ERP/MRP orders aren’t combined
      optimally across machines and shifts, causing more setups, higher pierce
      counts, and longer cycle times.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in and siloed data: OEM CAM tools (BySoft, TruTops, etc.)
      don’t generalize across mixed-machine shops; data isn’t leveraged to
      improve nests over time.
    - >-
      Skill availability: shops rely on a few experienced programmers; tribal
      knowledge isn’t captured, making performance variable and onboarding slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated import of CAD (DXF/DWG/STEP/IGES) and BOMs from ERP/MRP, with
      part deduplication and automatic material/thickness matching.
    - >-
      AI-driven true-shape nesting for sheet and tube with grain constraints,
      common-line cutting, micro-tabs, and heat-aware sequencing that learns
      optimal kerf and lead-in/out per material/machine.
    - >-
      Multi-order, multi-machine nesting planner that consolidates jobs by
      material/thickness and due date to minimize setups and pierce counts.
    - >-
      Dynamic remnant management: automatic remnant detection, cataloging, and
      reuse prioritization; barcode/QR labels for offcuts.
    - >-
      Cutlist creation and work instructions auto-generated for press brakes,
      weld cells, and kitting; optional NC export to major controllers (Trumpf,
      Bystronic, Amada, Mazak, BLM, Prima).
    - >-
      Closed-loop optimization: feedback from machine logs and quality checks to
      adjust cut speed, sequence, tabs, and nesting heuristics per plant.
    - >-
      Shop-floor apps for review/approval, last-minute changes, and re-nesting;
      API for ERP (Epicor, Infor, ECI, ProShop) and PLM integration.
    - >-
      What-if quoting: simulate yield, cycle time, and material cost per order
      to support engineering and sales.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce material scrap by 3–7% and programming time by 50–70% within 60 days,
    with vendor-agnostic AI nesting that learns from your actual cut performance
    and auto-generates cutlists and NC programs across sheet and tube.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, vendor-agnostic AI that learns from real cut outcomes across
    multiple OEM machines and materials, improving nests and NC over time; a
    continuously growing dataset and validated post library enable faster, more
    accurate deployment than OEM-siloed tools.
