  title: Cutlist & Yield Optimizer (Sheets and Lumber)
  description: >-
    AI agent that turns BOMs into optimized cutting patterns, labels, and
    machine-ready files to minimize waste.
  targetUsers:
    - Production manager
    - CNC/saw operator
    - Owner
  triggers:
    - New job/BOM received
    - Weekly material planning
    - Price spikes or shortages
  inputs:
    - 'BOM/parts list (CSV, DXF, or dimensions)'
    - 'Stock sizes and inventory (sheet sizes, board lengths)'
    - 'Kerf, tool diameter, grain/face constraints, edge-banding allowances'
    - 'Machine limits (bed size, saw stroke), safety margins'
  steps:
    - Parse BOM and validate constraints
    - Choose algorithm (sheet nesting vs. linear cut optimization)
    - Run multi-pass optimization for waste and time
    - Generate labels with part metadata and grain arrows
    - Export cut maps (DXF/PDF) and optional G-code
    - Create material usage and cost summary
  tools:
    - Python OR-Tools
    - OpenNest/SVGNest/Deepnest
    - DXF/SVG exporters
    - Google Sheets/Excel integration
    - 'Optional: CAMotics for quick checks'
  outputs:
    - Optimized cut maps (PDF/DXF)
    - Part labels (CSV/PDF)
    - G-code or toolpath files (optional)
    - Material usage and offcut report
  pricingModel:
    - Setup fee for rules and machine constraints

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Material waste from suboptimal cutting patterns typically runs 5–15% for
      mixed sheet-and-lumber jobs, directly eroding margins.
    - >-
      Manual translation of BOMs to cutlists introduces errors (part dims, grain
      flags, edge-band info) that cause rework and scrap.
    - >-
      Nesting/cut optimization tools are often machine- or vendor-specific,
      offline, and don’t unify sheets and solid lumber in one workflow.
    - >-
      Labeling and part traceability are inconsistent; mislabeling leads to
      assembly delays and remakes.
    - >-
      Remnant management is ad hoc; valuable offcuts are lost or never reused
      because no system tracks them.
    - >-
      Programming bottlenecks (estimating, nesting, post-processing) slow
      throughput and delay quotes and deliveries.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size shops lack analytics on yield, true material costs by
      job, and operator performance.
    - >-
      Integrating CAD/ERP/MES with machine-ready code is brittle;
      post-processors and file formats vary by OEM and version.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI BOM parsing from spreadsheets, PDFs, CAD/ERP exports; auto-detection of
      materials, grain, edge-banding, quantities, tolerances.
    - >-
      Unified optimizer for panels and solid lumber using mixed-integer
      optimization + heuristics; respects kerf, saw/router constraints, grain,
      defects, rip/crosscut rules.
    - >-
      Machine-ready post-processing for common CNC routers and panel saws (DXF,
      MPR, BPP, ISO G-code, PTX, etc.).
    - >-
      Auto-generated labels with barcodes/QR and human-readable data; supports
      Zebra/Brother printers and station workflows.
    - >-
      Remnant tracking: scans and catalogs offcuts with dims, material, grain;
      recommends reuse in future jobs.
    - >-
      Yield and cost analytics by job/material/operator; real-time dashboards
      and saved baselines.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors for CAD/ERP/MES (e.g., Cabinet Vision/Microvellum
      exports, NetSuite/JobBOSS/ECI Spruce).
    - >-
      Role-based approvals and digital traveler; mobile tablet for floor use;
      offline-first print queue and sync.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any BOM into optimal sheet-and-lumber cut plans, labels, and
    machine-ready files in minutes—boosting yield 2–8%, reducing programming
    time 50–80%, and standardizing traceability across OEMs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A unified, OEM-agnostic optimizer for both sheets and solid lumber with
    plug-and-play post-processors, continuously improved by network effects from
    aggregated (opt-in, anonymized) cut data—plus OEM/dealer certifications that
    lower switching costs and create distribution leverage.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production managers, estimators, and CNC operators at wood product
    manufacturers (NAICS 321999) who want to turn BOMs into precise cutlists,
    meet ship dates, and squeeze maximum yield from every sheet and board.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual nesting and spreadsheets waste material, mislabel parts,
    and bottleneck programming across saws, routers, and chop saws. Internal:
    Teams worry about tight margins, re-cuts, and late jobs. Philosophical: Good
    wood shouldn’t be wasted and skilled people shouldn’t fight paperwork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit yield and throughput. Built by
    manufacturing engineers and CNC practitioners, our AI optimizer integrates
    with common CAD/CAM, saws/routers, and labelers to deliver accurate patterns
    and machine-ready files you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload BOM/CAD and set materials, kerf, grain/defect rules, and machine
    constraints. 2) AI produces optimized cut maps, nests, labels, and NC files
    with feasibility checks. 3) Run jobs, capture yield and offcuts, and feed
    data back for continuous optimization.
  callToAction: Start a pilot with your real BOMs or book a 20‑minute demo.
  success: >-
    Lower material spend, higher yield, faster programming, error-proof
    labeling, reliable quotes, steady machine throughput, on-time delivery, and
    healthier margins with less waste.
  failure: >-
    Overbuying and scrap piles persist, hand-nesting burns hours, labels cause
    rework, deadlines slip, and margins erode.
