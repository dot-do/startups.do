  problem:
    - >-
      Manual inspection variability (20–40% miss rates on subtle defects like
      coating thin spots, weld undercut, or missing fasteners) creates escapes
      and rework.
    - >-
      NCRs are slow and inconsistent; evidence gathering, tagging, and routing
      typically costs 10–20 minutes per case and delays containment.
    - >-
      Late-stage discovery (final assembly/shipping) inflates cost of poor
      quality by 3–10x vs. in‑process detection.
    - >-
      Limited traceability; photos/evidence are not consistently linked to work
      orders, serials, or operator/station IDs for ISO 9001/FGIA audits.
    - >-
      Training new inspectors is time-consuming; tribal knowledge about what
      “good” looks like isn’t standardized or searchable.
    - >-
      No reliable, structured data on defect Pareto by line, shift, or supplier,
      hindering CAPA and process optimization.
    - >-
      Traditional rule-based vision struggles with variable finishes (gloss,
      anodized, powder), complex profiles, and lighting changes common in
      fenestration plants.
  solution:
    - >-
      Camera-enabled stations at weld, coating exit, assembly, and final
      inspection automatically capture images tied to barcode/QR work orders and
      serials.
    - >-
      Fine-tuned AI models detect fenestration-specific defects: weld
      porosity/undercut/spatter; coating runs, pinholes, fisheyes, orange peel,
      thin coverage; scratches/dents; assembly issues like missing screws,
      misaligned corners, gasket continuity, hardware presence/orientation.
    - >-
      Configurable digital checklists with pass/fail and tolerance thresholds;
      auto-attach annotated images and metadata (operator, line, timestamp, lot)
      to each step.
    - >-
      Automatic NCR generation with prefilled defect class, suspected root
      cause, containment actions, and evidence; routing to QMS/MES with SLA
      timers and notifications.
    - >-
      Dashboards and Pareto analysis by line/shift/supplier/material with SPC
      alerts; overlay guidance to operators for faster corrections.
    - >-
      Edge inference (Jetson/Intel) with local buffering and offline mode;
      secure sync to cloud for fleet analytics and model updates.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop feedback for rapid model improvement; weekly active
      learning batches and A/B validation to maintain target precision/recall.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors to common MES/ERP/QMS; REST/OPC UA interfaces for work
      orders, part IDs, and NCR workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce rework, escapes, and warranty costs by 25–50% within 90 days through
    photo-based, AI-driven defect detection and one-click NCRs with evidence,
    integrated to your MES/QMS. Deploy in under 2 weeks per line, run on-edge
    with <200 ms inference, and achieve audit-ready traceability with minimal
    operator friction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary image corpus and defect taxonomy specific to metal
    window and door manufacturing, prevalidated capture/lighting SOPs for
    reflective/anodized surfaces, and drop-in connectors to common MES/QMS give
    faster time-to-value and more robust performance than generic vision vendors
    or internal projects.

  character: >-
    Quality and operations leaders at metal window and door manufacturers who
    need consistent, objective inspections and audit-ready proof while keeping
    throughput high.
  problem: >-
    - External: Defects in welds, coating, and assembly slip past visual checks;
    paper checklists and NCRs lack evidence and traceability.

    - Internal: Teams are frustrated by rework, finger-pointing, and audit
    stress; confidence in inspections varies by shift.

    - Philosophical: Catching defects shouldn’t depend on who’s looking—proof
    should be automatic.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand fabrication, finishing, and assembly lines where
    corner welds, powder coat coverage, and hardware fit are hard to verify in
    real time.

    - Authority: Our AI is trained on industry-specific defects and produces
    clear, traceable annotations tied to part, lot, and station.
  plan: >-
    - 1) Connect station cameras or use existing images; map to part/serial from
    your MES.

    - 2) Auto-check against digital checklists; flag defects with bounding boxes
    and severity; prompt operator actions.

    - 3) Generate NCRs with annotated evidence and metadata; route to CAPA/ERP
    and track closure.

    - Assurances: Pilot a single cell in weeks; no major line changes; on-prem
    or secure cloud; you retain data ownership.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo with your line images.

    - Transitional: Get a sample NCR with annotated evidence and a QC checklist
    template.
  success: |-
    - Higher first-pass yield and fewer escapes.
    - Consistent inspections across shifts.
    - Faster, evidence-backed NCRs and audits.
    - Lower rework, scrap, and warranty costs.
    - Clear defect trends to drive CAPA and training.
  failure: |-
    - More escapes, rework, and warranty hits.
    - Ongoing audit findings and slow NCRs without proof.
    - Throughput losses and continued reliance on subjective checks.
