leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Excess working capital tied up in safety stock (typical 15–35% overage)
      due to rule-of-thumb min/max and siloed planning.
    - >-
      Service level volatility across echelons; local optimizations drive
      bullwhip and stockouts at downstream nodes.
    - >-
      Lead-time variability (supplier, transportation, customs) not modeled
      correctly; buffers are either insufficient or wasteful.
    - >-
      Slow refresh of policies (quarterly/annual) can’t keep up with demand
      shifts, promotions, or supply disruptions.
    - >-
      ERP/WMS/APS modules lack practical MEIO, forcing heavy spreadsheets and
      manual overrides that don’t scale to 10k–100k SKUs.
    - >-
      Planners lack transparent, defensible logic to justify policy settings to
      finance; limited auditability and governance.
    - >-
      Complex constraints (MOQ, case packs, shelf life, budget caps) are
      ignored, producing non-executable recommendations.
    - >-
      Shortage of in-house OR/MEIO expertise and expensive consulting
      engagements with long time-to-value (>6–12 months).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI/OR engine to infer demand and lead-time distributions from
      transactional data and compute safety stock, reorder points, and
      order-up-to levels across echelons.
    - >-
      Network-aware optimization that coordinates decoupling points and
      upstream/downstream buffers to minimize total working capital subject to
      service constraints.
    - >-
      Executable policy generation respecting MOQ, case packs, order calendars,
      budget caps, shelf-life, substitution, and supplier quotas.
    - >-
      Digital twin with Monte Carlo simulation to validate service levels and
      inventory/cost trade-offs pre-deployment.
    - >-
      Continuous policy recalibration (weekly/daily) triggered by demand shifts,
      supplier changes, or service drift, with guardrails and approvals.
    - >-
      Role-based UI: planners see recommendations and exceptions; finance views
      cash impact; operations see executable order policies.
    - >-
      One-click ERP integration (SAP/Oracle/NetSuite) to write back min/max,
      (s,S), (Q,R), or IBP parameters; full audit trail.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: target service by segment (A/B/C, critical spare),
      promotion/seasonality overlays, budget scenarios.
    - >-
      Pilot-to-production program: 6–8-week pilot on a subset (e.g., 5k SKUs, 2
      DCs) with guaranteed KPIs and CFO-ready ROI.
    - >-
      Option for outcome-based pricing tied to verified working capital
      reduction and service attainment.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit SKU-by-node service targets with 10–25% inventory reduction in 90 days.
    AI-driven MEIO computes executable safety stocks and reorder policies across
    echelons, integrates with your ERP, and continuously adapts to demand and
    lead-time variability—transparent, auditable, and finance-proof.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A production-proven MEIO engine that pairs solver-grade optimization with
    fast Monte Carlo validation, plus a governance layer that writes executable
    policies back to ERP with full auditability. Combined with an anonymized
    benchmark dataset for service target allocation and a partner-enabled pilot
    methodology that delivers CFO-verified savings in under 90 days, this
    shortens time-to-value and reduces perceived risk vs. suite modules.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops and supply chain leaders at manufacturers, distributors, and retailers
    who run multi‑echelon networks and are accountable for OTIF/DIFOT service
    and working capital.
  problem: >-
    - External: Demand variability, long lead times, and siloed nodes cause
    stockouts and overstock; spreadsheets and one‑size policies can’t keep up.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting and blame for service misses or bloated
    inventory erode confidence.

    - Philosophical: Hitting service shouldn’t require excess cash or
    heroics—policy should be data‑driven and fair.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the tension between service, cost, and variability
    across plants, DCs, and channels.

    - Authority: MEIO is an AI service by practitioners and data scientists;
    proven in complex networks, integrates with SAP/Oracle/Blue
    Yonder/Manhattan; referenceable results with transparent math.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect data and baseline (SKUs, nodes, BOMs, lead times,
    service goals). 2) Tune policies via stochastic simulation across echelons
    to compute safety stocks, reorder points, and order quantities that hit
    targets at minimum working capital. 3) Deploy to ERP/WMS and monitor with
    weekly refresh and exception alerts.

    - Agreement: Security‑first, transparent logic, measurable KPIs, pilot
    before scale—you own the parameters.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30‑minute assessment; start a 6‑week pilot.

    - Transitional: Download a sample policy report and ROI calculator; request
    a data‑readiness checklist.
  success: |-
    - Reliable service at lowest practical working capital.
    - 10–30% lower inventory with equal or better fill/OTIF.
    - 20–50% fewer stockouts/expedites and calmer operations.
    - Confident, auditable parameters for S&OP and daily planning.
    - Faster cash cycle and clearer cross‑functional alignment.
  failure: >-
    - Cash locked in the wrong places, write‑offs, and lost sales.

    - Chronic expediting, missed OTIF, and planner burnout.

    - Black‑box decisions and stale, one‑size policy settings that drift from
    reality.
