  problem:
    - >-
      Manual grading variability (inter- and intra-rater variability >15% CV)
      leads to inconsistent blends, rework, and yield loss.
    - >-
      Limited real-time visibility of bale chemistry (nicotine, sugars,
      moisture); lab sampling lag of 12–48 hours delays corrective action.
    - >-
      Blend formulation often over-specs expensive grades to avoid out-of-spec
      risk, inflating raw leaf cost by 1–3%.
    - >-
      Inadequate detection of defects (mold, foreign materials, water damage,
      off-color), causing contamination risk and scrappage.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across ERP/LIMS/warehouse makes it hard to optimally
      consume lots and maintain traceability for audits (CORESTA/ISO).
    - >-
      No closed-loop optimization: production setpoints and blend recipes aren’t
      continuously updated with incoming bale quality distributions.
    - >-
      Throughput bottlenecks at bale receiving and primary lines; human grading
      cannot keep pace during peak seasons.
    - >-
      High calibration burden for existing sensors (NIR) and limited
      transferability across crop years and origins.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time computer-vision grading at bale receiving and primary lines (RGB
      + optional hyperspectral) for color, texture, size, damage, mold, and
      foreign material detection.
    - >-
      Multi-modal chemistry predictions (NIR + vision features) for nicotine,
      sugars, moisture; adaptive, crop-year-robust calibrations.
    - >-
      Blend optimization engine (LP/MIP) minimizing cost subject to constraints:
      nicotine/moisture/sugar ranges, sensory class mix, origin quotas,
      regulatory limits, inventory and run-rate constraints.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration to ERP/LIMS/MES: auto-assign bales to blends,
      generate pick lists, and push updated setpoints as incoming quality
      distributions shift.
    - >-
      Operator workflows: guided sampling, exception handling,
      auto-hold/release, and root-cause analysis when lots trend out-of-spec.
    - >-
      Inventory and lot consumption optimizer: FIFO/FEFO with quality weighting
      to balance spec risk and cost.
    - >-
      QA and compliance dashboards: spec adherence, COA traceability, audit logs
      aligned with CORESTA/ISO methods.
    - >-
      Deployment options: edge/on-prem inference for low-latency control; cloud
      console for fleet analytics, benchmarking, and model management.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut raw leaf cost by 1–3% while tightening spec adherence (30–50% reduction
    in nicotine/moisture variance) via real-time, audit-ready computer vision +
    NIR grading and an optimization engine that formulates the lowest-cost blend
    meeting sensory/chemistry targets.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-manufacturer, multi-origin dataset enabling robust, adaptive models;
    integrated blend optimizer that jointly minimizes cost and spec risk;

  character: >-
    Leaf buyers, quality managers, and master blenders at tobacco factories who
    must hit sensory, nicotine, and moisture specs while reducing raw‑material
    cost.
  problem: >-
    External: Inconsistent bale quality, subjective grading, and volatile supply
    cause blend drift, rework, and higher costs. Internal: Teams are stuck
    firefighting and second‑guessing grades under pressure from production and
    finance. Philosophical: Consistent, compliant tobacco shouldn’t rely on
    guesswork when data can guide every bale.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to protect brand profile, meet specs, and control
    spend. Our AI combines production‑proven computer vision and optimization
    with tobacco process expertise, integrates with intake lines and ERP/MES,
    and delivers auditable, human‑in‑the‑loop recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess & integrate: line survey, data connectors, sample scans. 2)
    Calibrate: align models to panel feedback; validate nicotine/moisture
    predictions, costs, and constraints. 3) Run & optimize: real‑time bale
    grading and least‑cost blend recipes; operators approve and track KPIs.
    Agreement: your data stays yours; no changes go live without your sign‑off;
    clear ROI checkpoints.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or schedule a 30‑day pilot. Transitional: Request a
    sample grading report and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Stable sensory profile, higher spec conformance, lower blend costs, reduced
    rework and write‑offs, faster intake decisions, better inventory
    utilization, and full traceability from bale to batch.
  failure: >-
    Avoid missed specs, brand drift, overpaying for premium leaf, subjective
    intake disputes, QA/regulatory failures, rework, scrap, and line stoppages.
