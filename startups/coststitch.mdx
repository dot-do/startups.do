leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Quote and cost-sheet creation is slow (often 1–3 days per style) due to
      manual spreadsheets and tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Inconsistent and non-defensible cost assumptions (labor minutes,
      allowances, overhead, duty, freight) lead to pricing disputes and margin
      leakage.
    - >-
      Difficulty modeling MOQ, material substitution, and Incoterms
      (FOB/CIF/DDP) scenarios causes poor negotiations and lost orders.
    - >-
      Frequent changes in duty rates, freight costs, and FX introduce errors and
      rework.
    - >-
      Limited ability to benchmark estimated vs. actual COGS and learn over
      time; costing accuracy doesn’t improve.
    - >-
      Onboarding new cost engineers is slow; knowledge isn’t codified, making
      results dependent on a few experts.
    - >-
      Buyers increasingly demand faster, documented quotes; delays reduce win
      rate and credibility.
  solution:
    - >-
      BOM ingestion from Excel/CSV and PLM APIs; automatic parsing of
      components, quantities, UoM, and operations hints from spec sheets/tech
      packs.
    - >-
      Apparel-specific complexity model that converts features (stitch classes,
      seam length, pockets, finishes) to SMV with allowances; calibrated per
      factory line efficiency.
    - >-
      Cost engine that composes material, trims, labor, overhead absorption,
      wastage, duty (HS x COO), freight (lane, mode, Incoterms), and FX into
      standard cost.
    - >-
      Scenario runner for MOQ, yield, make/buy options, fabric alternatives,
      Incoterms (FOB/CIF/DDP), and freight modes with side-by-side comparisons.
    - >-
      Quote builder that generates buyer-facing, line-itemized, time-stamped
      PDFs/Excel and branded portals with assumption traceability and approvals.
    - >-
      Data connectors for FX, freight indices, and tariff libraries; alerts when
      rates shift beyond thresholds and suggest re-quoting.
    - >-
      Variance learning loop: compares estimated vs. actual COGS/post-mortem to
      auto-calibrate SMVs, overhead, and scrap factors by product/category/line.
    - >-
      Governance: roles/permissions, change logs, audit trail, versioning, and
      quote approval workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate audit-ready cost sheets and buyer-ready quotes in minutes from your
    BOM and style details. Apparel-specific AI models turn style complexity into
    defensible labor minutes and landed cost, run MOQ/duty/freight scenarios
    instantly, and benchmark estimates vs. actuals—cutting quote time by 60–80%
    and improving cost accuracy to within ±3–5%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from estimated vs. actual COGS across diverse apparel
    categories and factories, producing a defensible, apparel-native SMV and
    landed-cost model tied to operations—not generic CPQ math. Deep PLM
    integrations and assumption explainability create buyer trust and internal
    auditability that spreadsheets and generic tools can’t match.

    and OEM/ODM factories (not contractors) who need fast, accurate, defensible
    cost sheets and quotes.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual spreadsheet costing is slow, error-prone, and hard to
    defend; MOQ, duty, and freight swings change landed cost. Internal: Teams
    feel pressured by buyer deadlines and uncertain their numbers will protect
    margin. Philosophical: Costing should be transparent, data-driven, and
    defensible—not guesswork.

    Empathy: We know the stress of quoting cut-and-sew under tight timelines
    with moving assumptions. Authority: Apparel-specific AI trained on BOMs and
    style complexity (SMV/SAH), trims, overhead, duty, and freight; audit-ready
    logic; buyer-ready cost sheets; exports and scenario tools.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload BOM + style details, 2) Set
    labor/overhead/MOQ/duty/freight, 3) Auto-generate cost sheet and quote, 4)
    Run scenarios and export/share. Agreement: Transparent assumptions, secure
    data, no lock-in—cancel anytime.
