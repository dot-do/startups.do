  problem:
    - >-
      Exploration drilling is capital-intensive: $50–$300 per meter (RC vs core)
      and typically 40–60% of exploration budgets; even a 10–15% meter reduction
      can save $0.5–$2.0M per large program.
    - >-
      Low hit rates and inefficient target ranking: only a minority of holes
      deliver economic-grade intercepts; lack of probabilistic ranking leads to
      suboptimal allocation of meters.
    - >-
      Manual collar siting and azimuth/dip selection often ignores full
      uncertainty, access constraints, and environmental buffers, causing pad
      relocations, permit delays (weeks), and increased costs ($5k–$50k per
      pad).
    - >-
      Rig time wasted on moves and standby: 10–25% non-productive time due to
      poor sequence planning and access/heritage constraints, inflating cost/
      meter and schedule risk.
    - >-
      Fragmented data and tools (geophysics, geochem, geology, topography,
      heritage/permit data) complicate integrated decision-making; updates after
      each hole are slow (days rather than hours).
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate and harmonize geology, geochem, geophysics, structure, DEM, land
      access, environmental and cultural heritage layers into a single
      probabilistic targeting framework.
    - >-
      Generate probabilistic prospectivity volumes and expected grade-thickness
      predictions with uncertainty, conditioned on existing drilling and
      geophysics (physics-informed ML + geostatistics).
    - >-
      Optimize collar locations, azimuth/dip, and hole lengths via
      multi-objective constrained optimization (maximize expected value;
      minimize meters, pad and move cost; respect exclusion buffers and permit
      windows).
    - >-
      Sequence optimization for one or more rigs to minimize moves/standby and
      meet budget/schedule; dynamic replanning after each hole’s assays come in
      or when constraints change.
    - >-
      Scenario design with budget envelopes (e.g., $500k, $1M, $2M) and risk
      profiles; produce defensible plans for boards and regulators with audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Operational handoff: export collar files and schedules to
      Leapfrog/Micromine/Datamine/ArcGIS and contractor formats; field-ready
      maps and pad designs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

      AI that chooses where to drill, which azimuth/dip to run, and in what
      sequence—maximizing discovery probability under budget and access

  problem:
    - Meters are expensive; manual plans leave value on the table.
    - 'Targets compete for limited budget, rigs, and access windows.'
    - Suboptimal collar placement and orientation miss structures.
    - Redundant drilling and long rig moves inflate costs and timelines.
    - Plans don’t adapt quickly as assays and field conditions change.
  solution:
    - 'Rank targets by expected value per meter, not gut feel.'
    - 'Optimize collar locations, azimuths, and dips to hit the right geology.'
    - Sequence holes to maximize information gain and minimize rig moves.
    - 'Honour budget, permits, terrain, and environmental buffers by design.'
    - Continuously re‑prioritize as assays and field updates arrive.

      DEM/terrain, access and permit layers.
    - >-
