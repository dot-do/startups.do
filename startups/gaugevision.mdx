  problem:
    - >-
      Thickness profile variation (MD/CD) causes off-spec rolls, scrap, and claims; typical scrap 2–5% of throughput, with resin costs at $1.2–$1.8/lb.
    - >-
      Visual defects (gels, fisheyes, pinholes, die lines, streaks, edge beading, wrinkles, delamination) are inconsistently detected by human operators, leading to late catches.
    - >-
      SPC is often manual or siloed (Excel/whiteboards); Western Electric/Nelson rule violations are missed during busy shifts.
    - >-
      Operators lack rapid, actionable guidance to tune extruder/die/haul-off/lamination settings; changeovers and ramp-ups take longer than necessary.
    - >-
      Plants run mixed fleets of gauge/vision hardware; data formats are incompatible and not centrally analyzed.
    - >-
      Quality incidents trigger rework/returns and erode OTIF and customer trust, but root cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge dependent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload-driven AI QC: operators upload gauge profiles (CSV/JSON/OPC dumps) and images/video; service analyzes thickness/defects, flags SPC rule violations, and ranks likely root causes.
    - >-
      Actionable playbooks: defect-to-setting suggestions (e.g., adjust die bolt zones, nip pressure, air ring, haul-off speed, laminator tension) with confidence scores and estimated impact.
    - >-
      SPC automation: auto-calc Cp/Cpk/Pp/Ppk; apply Western Electric/Nelson rules; send alerts to Andon/Teams/Email/SMS when violations occur.
    - >-
      Cross-line benchmarking: compare profiles/defects across shifts, polymers, and SKUs; identify recipes prone to excursions.
    - >-
      Fast deployment: web portal + optional lightweight edge agent to auto-pull data from gauge/vision systems (NDC/Mahlo/Thermo, Cognex/Keyence) or from shared folders.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability: lot-level QC packet generation (PDF/API) for customers and audits (ISO 9001, BRCGS Packaging).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect, diagnose, and fix thickness and visual defects in minutes from any line—no new hardware required. Cross-vendor AI turns uploads into SPC alerts and machine-setting playbooks that cut scrap 0.5–1.5% and reduce complaint risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, domain-specific dataset and playbooks that map defect signatures to concrete machine-setting adjustments—continuously improved across customers—plus lightweight deployment that works with simple uploads, enabling fast ROI without new hardware.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Quality managers, process engineers, production supervisors at plastics packaging film and sheet manufacturers (blown film, cast film, biaxially oriented, laminated).
