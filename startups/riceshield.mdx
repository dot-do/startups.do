  title: Rice Pest/Disease Early Warning + Image Diagnostics
  description: >-
    Daily risk scoring for blast, bacterial leaf blight, brown planthopper;
    farmer-submitted photos analyzed for diagnosis and action thresholds.
  targetUsers:
    - Rice farmers
    - Extension agents
    - Input dealers/retailers
  triggers:
    - New weather forecast
    - New satellite image over field
    - Farmer sends plant/leaf/pest photo
  inputs:
    - Field location/boundary
    - Planting date and growth stage
    - 'Local management history (N rate, seed variety)'
    - Farmer images of symptoms or pests
  steps:
    - >-
      Ingest weather to compute disease/pest risk indices (temp, humidity, leaf
      wetness proxies)
    - Use satellite NDVI/RECI anomalies for stress hot-spotting
    - Score daily risk for blast/BLB/BPH by stage and local susceptibility
    - >-
      When photos arrive, run image classifier + prompt-based triage for
      differential diagnosis
    - >-
      Return action: scouting intensity, thresholds, recommended active
      ingredients (label-safe)
    - Track responses and outcomes to improve model thresholds
  tools:
    - OpenWeatherMap/NOAA NDFD
    - Sentinel-2 via Google Earth Engine
    - LightGBM/XGBoost models
    - 'On-device or cloud vision model (e.g., EfficientNet)'
    - 'Twilio/WhatsApp, Telegram'
    - Local pesticide label database (country-specific)
  outputs:
    - Daily risk level per pest/disease
    - Hot-spot map tiles and scouting routes
    - Actionable spray/scouting recommendation with PHI/REI notes
    - Case log for each photo submission
  pricingModel:
    - Freemium alerts; premium diagnostics ($0.10–$0.30/photo)
    - 'Season pass per farm (e.g., $8–$15/season)'
  humanInLoop: true

  risks:
    - Misdiagnosis from poor-quality images
    - Regulatory compliance for pesticide advice
    - 'Data gaps (cloud cover, hyper-local conditions)'
  dependencies:
    - Access to local pesticide labels/regulations
    - Lightweight photo upload channel
    - Ground-truth data to calibrate risk thresholds
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Rice pests/diseases (blast, bacterial leaf blight, brown planthopper)
      cause 10–30% average seasonal losses and up to 60% in severe outbreaks;
      detection is often too late for cost-effective control.
    - >-
      Farmers over/under-apply pesticides due to uncertainty; typical
      smallholders spend $30–80/ha/season on pest control with 15–40% waste from
      mistimed, inappropriate, or unnecessary sprays.
    - >-
      Diagnosis is slow and inaccurate: limited extension coverage (often >1,500
      farmers per agent) and long travel times delay action by days.
    - >-
      Generic weather alerts don’t translate into field-level,
      crop-stage-specific risk or economic thresholds; farmers lack clear,
      localized action triggers.
    - >-
      Co-ops, millers, and insurers lack timely, geolocated risk intelligence to
      manage supply risk, target advisory/inputs, and price/underwrite exposure.
    - >-
      Existing apps provide generic plant disease IDs with mixed accuracy and
      limited rice-specific thresholds; trust and sustained adoption remain low
      without measurable ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily risk scoring at 250 m–1 km resolution for blast, BLB, and brown
      planthopper combining localized weather (temp, humidity, leaf wetness
      proxy), crop phenology, and remote sensing (Sentinel-2, NDVI/EVI, canopy
      moisture indices).
    - >-
      Farmer-submitted photo diagnostics (leaf/plant/pest) with on-device
      preprocessing and server-side ensemble models; outputs: disease/pest
      likelihood, severity class, and recommended actions with economic
      thresholds.
    - >-
      Action thresholds tailored by crop stage, variety susceptibility, and
      local prices; guidance prioritizes IPM (resistant varieties, nitrogen
      management, field sanitation, biologicals), then targeted chemistries with
      PHI/IRAC/FRAC rotation.
    - >-
      Multi-channel delivery: WhatsApp/Telegram/LINE bots, Android app with
      offline caching, SMS/IVR summaries; extension dashboard for agents/co-ops.
    - >-
      Outbreak surveillance: heatmaps and alerts for co-ops/millers/insurers;
      API for integration into existing farm apps and insurer risk engines.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop verification: agronomist review queue for low-confidence
      cases; feedback closes the labeling loop for continuous model improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Daily, field-level early warning plus instant image diagnosis tailored to
    rice, delivering measurable yield protection (5–15% reduction in losses) and
    15–25% pesticide savings via localized action thresholds—accessible on
    WhatsApp/SMS and offline-ready.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rice-first model stack localized with IRRI/NARES data and field trials, plus
    a proprietary, geodiverse image dataset and action-threshold library;
    multi-channel (incl. WhatsApp/SMS) with offline capability and embedded
    economic calculators that tie alerts to real ROI—creating trust, stickiness,
    and defensibility beyond generic plant ID apps.

  character: >-
    Rice farmers, farm managers, and extension officers who want to protect
    yield and spray only when necessary—making confident, timely decisions for
    each field.
  problem: >-
    Villain: fast-moving blast, bacterial leaf blight, and brown planthopper
    driven by weather and resistance. External: outbreaks escalate between field
    visits; symptoms look alike; data is scattered. Internal: uncertainty about
    when to scout or spray. Philosophical: feeding communities shouldn’t rely on
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand how one missed week can cost a season. Our AI combines daily,
    field-level risk models with photo-based diagnostics trained on diverse rice
    datasets and reviewed by agronomists—designed with producers and extension
    partners for practical, in-field use.
  plan: >-
    1) Onboard: create farm, set location/variety/planting date. 2) Monitor: get
    daily blast/BLB/BPH risk scores and a 7‑day outlook; submit field photos via
    app or WhatsApp for rapid diagnosis and action thresholds. 3) Act: follow
    clear thresholds (green: monitor, amber: focused scouting, red: treat) with
    IPM-aligned recommendations.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free 30‑day pilot for your fields today. Or request a sample risk
    report and a live photo-diagnosis demo.
  success: >-
    Earlier detection, targeted interventions, protected yield, fewer
    unnecessary sprays, lower costs, and traceable decision logs for compliance
    and insurance—peace of mind knowing each field is watched daily.
  failure: >-
    Late detection and blanket spraying lead to avoidable yield loss, higher
    input costs, resistance pressure, regulatory risk, and stressed teams.
