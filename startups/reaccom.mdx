leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Disruptions (cancellations, misconnects, long delays) affect 3–6% of
      passengers; manual reaccommodation takes 6–20 minutes per PNR, creating
      spikes in AHT and call center backlogs.
    - >-
      Agents lack unified view of own and partner capacity; cross-airline
      rebooking often requires manual GDS work, leading to slow offers and
      higher involuntary denied boarding (IDB) risk.
    - >-
      Unoptimized prioritization (status, fare value, misconnect risk, special
      service needs) leads to revenue dilution, VIP churn, and non-compliance
      with duty-of-care rules (EU261/UK261/Canada APPR/US DOT expectations).
    - >-
      Inconsistent, delayed passenger communications drive low NPS/CSAT during
      IRROPS and increase compensation outlays and refund leakage.
    - >-
      Ticketing/reissue/EMD processing is often a separate queue, causing offer
      expiry, seat loss, and rework.
    - >-
      Limited analytics on disruption spend and performance hinders continuous
      improvement and regulatory reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time ingest of flight status, PNR/ticket/EMD, inventory/seatmaps, and
      partner availability via NDC/EDIFACT/GDS.
    - >-
      Dynamic, rules+AI prioritization by revenue value, loyalty tier,
      connection urgency, SSR needs, group logic, and regulatory obligations.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer to select reaccom options across own network and
      eligible partners: minimize total disruption cost (compensation, hotels,
      meals, reaccom fare) while maximizing show rate and NPS.
    - >-
      Automated offer drafting (rebook, travel credits, hotel/meal vouchers) and
      multichannel outbound comms (SMS, email, WhatsApp, in-app) with self-serve
      acceptance links.
    - >-
      Agent-assist UI for exceptions with explainable recommendations and
      one-click ticketing queue triggers (reissue/EMD) via PSS/NDC.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics for cost, speed, acceptance, comp exposure, and
      regulatory reporting; A/B test comms and offer strategies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven IRROPS brain that builds prioritized passenger lists, searches
    own/partner inventory in real time, drafts best-cost/best-experience offers
    with compliant communications, and optionally auto-triggers
    ticketing—cutting time-to-first-offer from minutes to seconds while lowering
    comp spend and call volume.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A pre-integrated optimizer that combines policy-aware prioritization,
    cross-carrier search, and cost-compliance modeling—plus a growing dataset of
    disruption outcomes and acceptance behavior that continuously improves offer
    quality and timing. Deep PSS/NDC connectors and airline-grade playbooks
    reduce time-to-value versus generalist chatbots or PSS-native modules.

  character: >-
    Airline IRROPS, network ops, and customer care teams who must rapidly rebook
    disrupted passengers at scale without blowing costs or loyalty.
  problem: >-
    - External: Weather, ATC, maintenance, and crew legality trigger mass
    disruptions; manual prioritization and cross-carrier rebooking are slow and
    inconsistent.

    - Internal: Teams face fragmented data, angry queues, and time pressure;
    every minute raises costs and CSAT risk.

    - Philosophical: Passengers deserve proactive, fair reaccommodation—no one
    should wait hours when a seat exists.

    - Empathy: We’ve lived IRROPS and understand DOT/EU261, crew, and partner
    constraints in real-time recovery.

    - Authority: Proven at airline scale; integrates with host/GDS/NDC and
    interline partners; SOC 2/GDPR ready; delivers measurable recovery KPIs.
  plan: |-
    - Process:
      1) Connect PNR, schedule, inventory, and partner data
      2) Configure policies and priority rules (loyalty, misconnects, SSRs, crew/legal)
      3) Bot builds prioritized reaccommodation lists, searches own/partner options, drafts offers and messaging
      4) Human approves; bot triggers ticketing/queues and sends comms; track outcomes
    - Agreement:
      - Low-risk pilot on selected hubs/routes
      - Human-in-the-loop by default; no passenger contact without approval
      - Security, compliance, audit logs, and clear SLAs
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Request a live demo and launch a 30–60 day pilot.

    - Transitional: Get the IRROPS ROI calculator, recovery playbook, and
    readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - Faster recovery (minutes, not hours) and higher CSAT/NPS

    - More proactive reaccommodations; fewer overnights and waivers

    - Lower disruption costs (hotels/vouchers/handling) and protected
    revenue/loyalty

    - Reduced agent handle time; consistent, compliant decisions and
    communications
  failure: |-
    - Long queues, social blowups, and compensation overruns
    - Missed connections, legality busts, and partner disputes
    - Lost revenue, brand damage, and regulator scrutiny
