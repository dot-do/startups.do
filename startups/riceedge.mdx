  problem:
    - >-
      Mid- and late-season uncertainty around yield and harvest timing leads to
      avoidable field losses (lodging, shattering) and quality downgrades after
      rain events.
    - >-
      Cloud cover and limited in-field scouting data reduce the accuracy and
      frequency of crop status updates, especially in humid Gulf states.
    - >-
      Harvest timing decisions are constrained by equipment capacity and dryer
      schedules; misalignment causes bottlenecks and penalties (moisture
      discounts, higher drying costs).
    - >-
      Generic decision support tools lack rice-specific phenology and head-rice
      optimization, resulting in suboptimal timing recommendations.
    - >-
      Growers often lack field-level risk signals (lodging probability, heavy
      rain risk in next 10–14 days) to prioritize harvest order across dozens of
      fields.
    - >-
      Consultants and mills have limited visibility to aggregate harvest
      readiness across growers, complicating logistics and procurement planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Weekly field-level yield forecasts (point estimate + 80% confidence
      interval) from mid-boot through maturity, updated with SAR/optical imagery
      and weather.
    - >-
      Harvest Window Advisor that ranks fields by optimal harvest date and
      urgency score, balancing head rice optimization, lodging risk, expected
      rainfall, and equipment/dryer capacity.
    - >-
      Lodging Risk Index (0–100) and 10–14 day heavy rain probability tailored
      to field conditions and variety.
    - >-
      Moisture trajectory and maturity alerts to hit target cut moisture;
      integrates dryer fee schedules to quantify $/acre trade-offs.
    - >-
      Equipment and logistics planner: scenario tool to align combine capacity,
      trucking, and dryer schedules with field readiness.
    - >-
      Post-harvest backtesting and ROI report per field and per grower (losses
      avoided, premiums captured, timing accuracy).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, rice-specific yield forecasts and harvest window rankings that
    maximize head rice and minimize lodging/rain losses—updated weekly, accurate
    under cloud cover (SAR-enabled), integrated with equipment and delivery
    logistics, and proven to deliver 3–7x ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rice-first modeling stack combining SAR/optical fusion for cloud resilience,
    variety-specific phenology calibrated with multi-year yield monitor data,
    and a head-rice–aware harvest optimizer validated in extension trials—plus
