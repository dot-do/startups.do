  title: Yield & Harvest Forecasting (Vision + Climate)
  description: >-
    Predicts marketable yield by SKU over 1–6 weeks using fruit/head counts from
    images and time-to-harvest models using DLI/GDD.
  targetUsers:
    - Sales/operations planners
    - Head growers
  triggers:
    - New image count pass
    - Weekly operations meeting
    - Large climate change (cloudy week)
  inputs:
    - Periodic aisle-walk photos/videos
    - Historical yields by bay/SKU
    - 'Climate logs (temp, DLI, CO2)'
    - Crop stage and planting dates
  steps:
    - Count fruit/heads via CV and estimate size class distribution
    - Model maturation speed from climate (GDD/DLI)
    - Produce weekly forecast per bay/SKU with confidence intervals
    - Compare to open orders; flag gaps/surplus
    - Continuously recalibrate with actuals
  tools:
    - YOLOv8/SAHI for counting
    - Time-series models (LightGBM/Prophet)
    - Retool/Power BI dashboard
    - CSV/ERP export
  outputs:
    - 1–6 week harvest forecast (SKU x week)
    - Confidence bands and drivers
    - Exception list (shortfalls/surplus)
  pricingModel:
    - Monthly per hectare or per SKU
    - Optional per-ton-forecasted usage fee
  humanInLoop: true

    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 7
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Occlusion/lighting impact on counts
    - Cultivar differences
    - Label noise
  dependencies:
    - Image capture cadence
    - Access to historical yields
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Short-term (1–6 week) yield forecasts are highly inaccurate (often 20–40%
      MAPE), leading to frequent over/under-supply.
    - >-
      Lack of SKU-level forecasts by cultivar, block, and grade makes it hard to
      match contracts and retail programs.
    - >-
      Labor scheduling for harvest crews is reactive, increasing overtime costs
      and missed windows for marketable quality.
    - >-
      Mismatch between expected and actual volume creates order penalties,
      rushed logistics, and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Excess shrink from overmature or unharvested product (2–8% typical) due to
      poor visibility of ripening/marketability.
    - >-
      Data silos between imaging, climate computer, and ERP prevent a single
      source of truth for planning.
    - >-
      Manual scouting and counting are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and do not
      scale across multiple bays/greenhouses.
    - >-
      Weather/light variability (DLI) and temperature (GDD) shifts harvest
      timing unpredictably without robust models.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision counts: Fixed or mobile cameras capture fruit/head counts,
      size distribution, and maturity/ripeness cues per bay/row; models trained
      per cultivar and canopy architecture.
    - >-
      Time-to-harvest modeling: DLI- and GDD-based phenology models estimate
      maturation/harvest windows and integrate short-term solar and temperature
      forecasts to adjust timing daily.
    - >-
      Marketability classification: Detects defects, size class, color stage,
      and pack-grade likelihood to forecast marketable yield by SKU, not just
      biological yield.
    - >-
      Forecast engine: SKU/block-level forecasts aggregated to daily/weekly
      buckets with confidence intervals, bias correction, and exception
      handling.
    - >-
      Integrations: Two-way integrations with climate computers (Priva,
      Hoogendoorn, Argus, Ridder), ERP/production planning (e.g., Microsoft
      D365/Agriware, SAP, custom), and order systems via REST API.
    - >-
      Planner tools: Scenario planning (e.g., light/temperature setpoint
      changes), harvest labor scheduling, heatmaps by bay, and contract coverage
      tracking.
    - >-
      Onboarding & calibration: 4–6 week calibration per crop/cultivar using
      existing historical yield/climate data; ongoing model drift monitoring and
      automatic recalibration.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, SKU-level 1–6 week harvest forecasts that combine computer vision
    fruit/head counts with DLI/GDD-driven time-to-harvest models—reducing
    forecast error to <12–15% MAPE, cutting shrink by 20–40%, and aligning
    labor, logistics, and sales in one system.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cultivar-specific, multimodal dataset linking image-derived counts and
    quality signals to DLI/GDD-driven harvest timing, integrated directly with
    climate computers and ERPs—creating a closed-loop planning system that
    continuously learns from outcomes. This data network effect and embedded
    workflow integration are difficult to replicate.
