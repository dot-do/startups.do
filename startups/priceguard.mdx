  problem:
    - >-
      Small and mid-sized specialty food retailers lack real-time visibility
      into local and online competitor prices, leading to margin leakage and
      lost sales.
    - >-
      Manual price checking (phone calls, browsing Instacart/Shopify sites,
      Google Shopping) consumes 5–15 hours/week per store and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Retailers inadvertently violate brand MAP policies on their own sites or
      ad feeds, risking supplier penalties and loss of co-op funds.
    - >-
      Retailers cannot easily detect and escalate competitor MAP violations to
      brands, leaving them disadvantaged against rule-breakers.
    - >-
      POS and ecommerce systems are not equipped to propose optimal price
      changes that respect MAP, margin targets, and local competition.
    - >-
      Price image is fragile in specialty categories (coffee, chocolate, cheese,
      supplements): a few over/under-priced KVIs materially impact basket
      conversion.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuous price monitoring from local/online competitors (zip-code aware)
      for a curated list of KVIs plus long-tail SKUs.
    - >-
      Automated MAP policy extraction and monitoring across retailer’s ads
      (site, Google Merchant Center) and competitor listings; alert on
      violations within hours.
    - >-
      AI price recommendations that optimize for margin, velocity, MAP, and
      price image; one-click push to POS/ecommerce.
    - >-
      Brand escalation workflows: bundle evidence of competitor MAP violations
      to share with brand reps/distributors.
    - >-
      Impact analytics: quantify margin lift, revenue change, and compliance
      score; run controlled price tests by category.
    - >-
      Low-friction integrations with common POS/ecommerce platforms for item
      mapping, costs, and price publishing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven pricing copilot tuned for specialty food retailers: monitor local
    and online competitors, catch MAP violations fast, and auto-propose

    prices and MAP policies, plus out-of-the-box POS/ecommerce integrations and
