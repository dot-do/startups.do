  vision: "Zero heat-related product losses in confectionery distribution."
  mission: "AI-powered route optimization and packaging decisions to eliminate melt damage while maintaining delivery efficiency."
  purpose: "Protect sweet products from heat damage through intelligent logistics."
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - "Heat-related product loss: chocolate and coated candies soften/melt above ~86°F/30°C, causing returns, write-offs, and retailer chargebacks during warm months."
    - "Inefficient routing during heat waves: static routes don't shift stop order to cooler hours or shaded docks, extending dwell time and exposure."
    - "Over- or under-spending on protective packaging: blanket rules (e.g., always add gel packs June–Sept) waste money; ad-hoc decisions cause damage."
    - "Limited visibility: dispatchers lack SKU-level melt risk + weather forecasts paired with vehicle insulation/reefer capacity to make data-driven decisions."
    - "Driver compliance gaps: without clear on-device instructions and alerts, best-laid heat-mitigation plans aren't followed in the field."
    - "Fragmented tools: route planning, weather apps, and packaging guidelines are not integrated into a single, repeatable workflow."
  solution:
    - "AI route optimization incorporating: forecasted temperature by hour/route segment, store dock microclimate, and vehicle insulation to schedule hot-risk stops at cooler times."
    - "SKU-level melt-risk scoring using product attributes (fat content, coating, packaging) to recommend the minimum viable protection (insulated totes, gel packs, pallet covers)."
    - "Dynamic stop sequencing with retailer time windows and service times to minimize dwell during hottest hours while preserving SLAs."
    - "Driver app with heat alerts, step-by-step handling (e.g., "Stage cooler before departure," "Deliver chocolate cases first," "Shade required"), and proof-of-condition photo prompts."
    - "Packaging optimizer that balances cost vs. predicted risk and auto-prints protection instructions/labels by stop and SKU."
    - "Integration with TMS/ERP (e.g., NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics), telematics (Samsara/Geotab), and weather APIs to make planning automatic."
    - "Exception monitoring: predicted vs. actual exposures; automatic post-route analysis to refine models and quantify ROI."
  uniqueValueProp: "Cut melt-related losses and packaging spend while keeping on-time deliveries by turning forecasted heat risk into optimized routes and SKU-specific protection plans—automated, measurable, and driver-executable."
  unfairAdvantage: "SKU-specific melt-risk models combined with forecast-integrated routing and prescriptive protection guidance—continuously trained on real return/claim outcomes—plus insurer and packaging partner programs that translate risk reduction into tangible cost savings and discounts."
  customerSegments:
    - "Primary: Confectionery Merchant Wholesalers (NAICS 424450) operating their own local/regional delivery fleets (5–100 trucks)."
    - "Secondary: 3PLs and DSD distributors servicing confectionery brands to convenience/grocery accounts in warm regions (Sun Belt, SoCal)."
    - "Tertiary: Mixed snack/candy wholesalers (NAICS 424410/424490) with material confectionery volume and heat exposure."
  channels:
    - "Direct outbound to NAICS 424450 lists focusing on Sun Belt states; target Ops/Logistics Directors with a 20-minute "Heat Season ROI" demo."
    - "Partnerships with packaging suppliers (gel packs, insulated totes, pallet covers) offering co-marketing and bundled discounts; affiliate revenue on packaging upsells."
    - "Telematics partners (Samsara/Geotab) marketplace listings and co-selling; use vehicle temp/door sensors to enrich value."
    - "Industry associations: sponsor National Confectioners Association and Convenience Distribution Association webinars titled "Heat-Safe Route Planning—Cut Returns by 40%."."
    - "Seasonal campaigns: March–May "Heat Readiness" assessments (free 2-week pilot + ROI report) to lock in June–Sept contracts; October renewals for next season."
    - "Content marketing: calculator tool (melt-loss ROI), playbooks (early-morning routing, dock shading), case studies with quantified savings."
    - "Land-and-expand: start with 1–2 depots in hot regions; expand fleet-wide post-pilot based on measured KPIs."
    - "Channel for smaller wholesalers: integrations into SMB route planners (e.g., Routific/OptimoRoute) via add-on API; list in their marketplaces."
  revenueStreams:
    - "SaaS subscription per active delivery vehicle: $79–$129/vehicle/month (tiered by fleet size)."
    - "Base platform fee: $250–$1,000/month per company (includes weather, SKU database, dashboards)."
    - "Implementation/integration fee: $3,000–$25,000 one-time (ERP/TMS, telematics, custom SKUs)."
    - "Premium analytics add-on (enterprise): $500–$2,000/month for advanced forecasting and insurer-grade reports."
    - "Seasonal surge option: month-to-month July–Sept with uplift (+20%) for seasonal-only customers."
    - "Affiliate/partner revenue: 3–8% on recommended packaging purchases (opt-in)."
  costStructure:
    - "Engineering and data science (routing optimization, risk modeling)."
    - "Cloud infrastructure (compute for route solves, databases), weather and maps API usage fees."
    - "Mobile app development and device management support."
    - "Sales and marketing (association sponsorships, webinars, case studies), partner channel commissions."
    - "Customer success/onboarding (SKU data setup, route policy configuration, driver training)."
    - "Data acquisition/maintenance for SKU thermal properties; SOC 2/ISO 27001 compliance costs."
    - "Insurance and legal; enterprise security questionnaires; audits."
  keyMetrics:
    - "Heat-damage rate: % orders/lines returned due to heat (target: -40% within 90 days)."
    - "Packaging cost per stop: $/stop on protective materials (target: -15–25% while maintaining damage reduction)."
    - "Exposure minutes: average minutes above 86°F per sensitive SKU per route (target: -30%)."
    - "% stops scheduled in high-risk hours (local noon–4pm) for sensitive SKUs (target: -35%)."
    - "On-time-in-full (OTIF) adherence with adjusted routes (target: ≥98% with heat-aware re-sequencing)."
    - "Driver compliance: % completion of heat checklists/photo proof (target: ≥95%)."
    - "Claim value avoided (modeled vs. baseline): $ saved per month per depot (target: $1,500–$5,000+)."
    - "Route efficiency impact: change in total drive + dwell time (target: ≤+1% vs. baseline while achieving risk reduction; often -2–5% via better sequencing)."
    - "Activation and time-to-value: pilot live in ≤2 weeks; payback in ≤3 months."
    - "Sales funnel: pilot-to-paid conversion ≥50%; logo churn <5% annually."
