  problem:
    - >-
      Heat-related product loss: chocolate and coated candies soften/melt above
      ~86°F/30°C, causing returns, write-offs, and retailer chargebacks during
      warm months.
    - >-
      Inefficient routing during heat waves: static routes don’t shift stop
      order to cooler hours or shaded docks, extending dwell time and exposure.
    - >-
      Over- or under-spending on protective packaging: blanket rules (e.g.,
      always add gel packs June–Sept) waste money; ad-hoc decisions cause
      damage.
    - >-
      Limited visibility: dispatchers lack SKU-level melt risk + weather
      forecasts paired with vehicle insulation/reefer capacity to make
      data-driven decisions.
    - >-
      Driver compliance gaps: without clear on-device instructions and alerts,
      best-laid heat-mitigation plans aren’t followed in the field.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools: route planning, weather apps, and packaging guidelines
      are not integrated into a single, repeatable workflow.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI route optimization incorporating: forecasted temperature by hour/route
      segment, store dock microclimate, and vehicle insulation to schedule
      hot-risk stops at cooler times.
    - >-
      SKU-level melt-risk scoring using product attributes (fat content,
      coating, packaging) to recommend the minimum viable protection (insulated
      totes, gel packs, pallet covers).
    - >-
      Dynamic stop sequencing with retailer time windows and service times to
      minimize dwell during hottest hours while preserving SLAs.
    - >-
      Driver app with heat alerts, step-by-step handling (e.g., “Stage cooler
      before departure,” “Deliver chocolate cases first,” “Shade required”), and
      proof-of-condition photo prompts.
    - >-
      Packaging optimizer that balances cost vs. predicted risk and auto-prints
      protection instructions/labels by stop and SKU.
    - >-
      Integration with TMS/ERP (e.g., NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics), telematics
      (Samsara/Geotab), and weather APIs to make planning automatic.
    - >-
      Exception monitoring: predicted vs. actual exposures; automatic post-route
      analysis to refine models and quantify ROI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut melt-related losses and packaging spend while keeping on-time deliveries
    by turning forecasted heat risk into optimized routes and SKU-specific
    protection plans—automated, measurable, and driver-executable.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    SKU-specific melt-risk models combined with forecast-integrated routing and
    prescriptive protection guidance—continuously trained on real return/claim
    outcomes—plus insurer and packaging partner programs that translate risk
    reduction into tangible cost savings and discounts.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Logistics/operations manager at a confectionery merchant wholesaler (NAICS
    424450) who must deliver heat‑sensitive candy and chocolate profitably, on
    time, and unmelted.
  problem: >-
    External: summer heat, traffic, and tight windows cause melted product,
    re-deliveries, and lost margin; Internal: juggling drivers, SKUs, and
    weather creates stress and guesswork; Philosophical: quality sweets should
    arrive sweet—customers shouldn’t pay for routing risk.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we know warm weather silently erodes margins and relationships;
    Authority: our AI blends live weather, SKU melt points, and proven route
    science to cut melt claims and miles for confectionery distributors.
  plan: >-
    1) Import orders and SKU data or connect TMS/ERP; 2) Set constraints and
    service goals, then auto‑generate routes with heat‑protection steps (cooler
    packs, insulation, shaded/indoor drop, early/late windows); 3) Dispatch and
    monitor with live weather and exceptions; adjust with one click. Low‑risk
    pilot, fast onboarding, keep current carriers.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot; Transitional:
    download the Melt‑Risk Route Checklist and run the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Intact deliveries in any season; fewer returns and chargebacks; higher
    on‑time performance; lower miles and overtime; extended shipping into hotter
    months; happier customers and stronger brand.
  failure: >-
    Melted deliveries, write‑offs, damaged accounts, wasted driver hours, missed
    windows, negative reviews, and margin leakage every summer.
