  problem:
    - >-
      Early-phase site analysis is fragmented and time-consuming (4–12 hours per
      site) across topo, flood, transit, noise, wind, sun, and base CAD
      creation.
    - >-
      Architects lack a standardized, legally-cited, and CAD-ready deliverable;
      manual GIS workflows often miss layers or use outdated data.
    - >-
      Licensing and attribution risks from mixed data sources (e.g.,
      imagery/Street View) create legal exposure for firms.
    - >-
      Design teams struggle to keep layers georeferenced and consistent (CRS
      mishaps, unit errors, layer naming), causing rework downstream in
      Revit/CAD.
    - >-
      Clients expect rapid feasibility; teams can’t reliably produce a complete
      context pack within 24 hours without specialists.
    - >-
      Existing tools either focus on 3D modeling/zoning or general GIS, not a
      turnkey “site kit” optimized for architecture deliverables.
  solution:
    - >-
      Web app + Revit/AutoCAD/Rhino plugins: input address/lat-lon/parcel or
      upload AOI polygon; select radius and outputs; generate.
    - >-
      Outputs: zipped kit with DWG/DXF base underlays (layered, georeferenced),
      GIS (GeoPackage/GeoJSON), rasters (GeoTIFF/PNG), and a client-ready PDF
      summary with citations.
    - >-
      Automated analyses: slope/aspect from DEM, flood risk overlay (where
      available), transit proximity and 15-min isochrones, street
      hierarchy/traffic context, sun path diagrams, wind roses, preliminary
      noise heatmap, and street-level snapshots.
    - >-
      Coverage-aware pipeline: shows which layers are available before purchase;
      uses open data by default (OSM, OpenTopography, Copernicus, FEMA,
      Transitland, Global Wind Atlas, Meteostat/EPW).
    - >-
      Data lineage and legal pack: per-layer metadata, date stamps, licensing,
      and disclaimers; QA checks for CRS, units, and completeness.
    - >-
      Versioning and watchlists: re-run kits when key datasets update; diff
      report highlights changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Get a complete, citation-backed site context kit in under 15
    minutes—georeferenced CAD base layers, sun/wind/flood/transit/noise visuals,
    and a client-ready PDF report—standardized for Revit/AutoCAD with auditable
    sources.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    CAD-native, citation-backed site kits delivered in minutes with
    firm-specific templates and plugins, plus rigorous data lineage and
    licensing compliance. Over time, proprietary coverage/quality indexes and
    firm-tuned templates create switching costs and a defensible workflow moat.

  problem:
    - Site research takes days across scattered sources.
    - Inconsistent formats and misaligned data derail CAD/BIM workflows.
    - 'Missed constraints cause redesigns, fees, and schedule risk.'
