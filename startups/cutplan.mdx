leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap rates of 10–18% are common when orders are optimized locally (per
      shift/line) without global pooling, constraints for coatings/orientation,
      and systematic remnant reuse.
    - >-
      Frequent thickness/coating/model changeovers and pattern switches cost
      30–90 minutes of lost availability per line per day, depressing OEE and
      on-time delivery.
    - >-
      Manual nesting and schedule adjustments consume 2–4 planner hours per day,
      are error-prone, and do not react well to rush orders or breakage recuts.
    - >-
      OEM-provided optimizers are siloed to a machine or cell; they rarely
      optimize across multiple lines/plants, model changeover penalties, or
      enforce complex real-world constraints at scale.
    - >-
      Machine-ready files often require manual tweaks due to format mismatches
      or missing metadata (labels, break lines, low-E orientation), introducing
      rework and delays.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into true yield drivers (pattern design, remnant
      utilization, coating/thickness mix) impedes continuous improvement and
      waste reduction.
    - >-
      Real-time disruptions (breakage, coating defects, late trucks, rush
      orders) are not re-optimized quickly, causing cascading lateness and
      scrap.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven global cut-plan and nesting that pools orders across time
      windows, lines, and (optionally) plants to minimize scrap and changeovers
      while meeting due dates and downstream process constraints.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization (yield, changeover penalties, due-date
      adherence, furnace/laminator sequence compatibility) with tunable weights
      and guardrails.
    - >-
      Automated remnant inventory capture and reuse rules to prioritize
      high-value remnants and reduce store-time and write-offs.
    - >-
      Event-driven re-optimization (rush orders, breakage recuts, quality holds)
      that regenerates feasible plans in minutes and re-issues machine files
      with traceable deltas.
    - >-
      Seamless export of machine-ready programs and labels to major OEM cutting
      tables; validation layer ensures file conformance and prevents operator
      edits.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics: track scrap by cause, changeovers avoided, yield by
      SKU/coat/thickness, and OEE impact—feeding continuous improvement and
      pricing/mix decisions.
    - >-
      API-first integrations for ERP/MES (order intake, BOMs), WMS (remnants),
      and QA (defect zones) with secure on-prem edge gateway for machine
      connectivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap by 2–6 percentage points and cut changeover time 20–40% with an
    AI optimizer that pools orders across lines/shifts, respects real-world
    glass constraints (thickness, coating orientation, edge deletion, grain),
    and exports machine-ready programs for major OEM cutting tables—delivering
    payback in under 6 months and analytics to sustain >92% yield.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization engine trained and tuned on flat glass
    constraints (low-E orientation, edge deletion, breakout patterns,
    thickness/coating campaigns) combined with an OEM-verified export library
    that eliminates operator edits. Accumulated performance telemetry across
    plants feeds proprietary benchmarks and auto-tuning, creating a data network
    effect that competing generic nesters and OEM point tools cannot match.

  character: >-
    Flat glass production planner/plant manager who needs higher yield, fewer
    changeovers, and on-time shipments.
