leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-value RTGS and ACH infrastructures face operational, cyber,
      liquidity, and fraud anomalies; current detection is rule-heavy,
      batch-oriented, and lags by minutes to hours, increasing systemic risk and
      incident cost.
    - >-
      False positive rates are high (often >5% of alerts), overwhelming limited
      supervision/operations teams and delaying true incident response.
    - >-
      Limited explainability of alerts inhibits regulator and operator
      confidence, slows decision-making, and hinders auditability against
      CPMI-IOSCO PFMI requirements.
    - >-
      ISO 20022 migration introduces new data fields and semantics (pacs.009,
      camt.052/053/054), making existing monitoring brittle and increasing model
      drift risk.
    - >-
      Data sovereignty and security constraints prevent use of public SaaS
      analytics; central banks need on-premise or sovereign cloud with strict
      access controls and HSM integration.
    - >-
      Fragmented visibility across RTGS, ACH, and liquidity tools prevents early
      detection of gridlocks, participant distress, and unusual routing
      patterns.
    - >-
      Procurement and integration cycles are long and risky; stakeholders need
      measurable pilot outcomes and low-friction deployment paths.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid ML + rule engine optimized for ISO 20022 (pacs/camt) and NACHA
      formats, detecting operational, cyber, fraud-pattern, and liquidity
      anomalies in <5 seconds end-to-end.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: human-readable root-cause narratives (SHAP-based feature
      attributions + domain rules), scenario lineage, and audit trails aligned
      to CPMI-IOSCO PFMI and NIST 800-53 controls.
    - >-
      Liquidity stress early-warning: queue growth, payment gridlock formation,
      rejection spike detection, participant-level net positions, and circular
      routing anomalies.
    - >-
      Model governance and drift monitoring: automated stability checks,
      challenger models, bias/quality dashboards; change control aligned to SR
      11-7 and model risk management best practices.
    - >-
      Real-time case management and escalation: playbooks mapped to incident
      types; integrations with ITSM/SOC (ServiceNow, JIRA) and SIEM
      (Splunk/Elastic) for unified response.
    - >-
      Deployment choices: on-prem hardened appliances or sovereign cloud (AWS
      GovCloud/Azure Govt/Local Sovereign), with HSM integration
      (Thales/Entrust) and data never leaving jurisdiction.
    - >-
      Regulatory-grade reporting: audit packs for incidents, trend and
      stress-test simulation, ISO 20022 migration quality reports, and quarterly
      resilience reviews.
    - >-
      Safe pilot path: read-only mirror feed, 60–90 day pilot with measurable
      KPIs (precision/recall, MTTD, FP rate, operator workload impact).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Near-real-time, explainable anomaly detection for RTGS/ACH with
    regulator-grade governance: detect and explain threats and operational
    issues within seconds, reduce false positives by 50–70%, surface early
    liquidity stress signals, and integrate seamlessly into sovereign,
    air-gapped environments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Regulator-grade, domain-specific anomaly library and explainability for ISO
    20022/NACHA built with central bank pilots; sovereign-ready, low-latency
    engine certified with major RTGS/ACH vendors; and a model governance
    framework aligned to PFMI and SR 11-7 that most generic analytics vendors
    lack.

    Central bank operations, oversight, and risk teams (NAICS 521110) who must
    keep RTGS/ACH running safely and transparently, 24/7, to protect stability
    and trust.
  problem: >-
    External: Hidden anomalies, cyber/ops incidents, fraud patterns, liquidity
    shocks, and data-quality breaks in RTGS/ACH flows. | Internal: Limited
    real-time visibility and explainability; alert fatigue; slow, manual triage.
    | Philosophical: Critical payments should be predictable, explainable, and
    trusted by design.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of zero-failure payment oversight. RTGS/ACH
    Payment System Anomaly Watch is built for monetary authorities, aligned with
    CPMI/PFMI principles and ISO 20022, using explainable AI, privacy-by-design,
    and on-prem/air‑gapped deployment options—so you get transparency without
    compromising sovereignty.

    payment streams.
  success: >-
    Detect anomalies within minutes; cut false positives and MTTR; gain
    defendable, audit-ready explanations; strengthen operational resilience;
    meet supervisory expectations; protect liquidity and public confidence.
  failure: >-
    Missed or late-detected anomalies trigger outages and settlement delays,
    amplify liquidity and fraud risks, invite supervisory findings and costly
    investigations, and erode trust in national payment infrastructure.
