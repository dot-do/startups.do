  problem:
    - >-
      Bottled water demand is highly weather- and promo-sensitive, causing
      20–40% WMAPE at SKU-week-channel in many plants and frequent stockouts
      during heat waves.
    - >-
      Planning tools rarely bridge demand forecasts and executable line/shift
      schedules; schedulers manually stitch plans in Excel, leading to low
      schedule adherence (<75%) and excess changeovers.
    - >-
      Promo lifts are inconsistently captured across retailers and regions;
      planners lack a fast way to test event scenarios (heat waves, BOGOs) and
      convert them into feasible production plans.
    - >-
      Capacity constraints (line speeds, blow-mold vs. filler, tank capacities,
      labor rosters, CIP, maintenance) aren’t modeled together, causing
      overtime, premium freight, and lost sales.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation (ERP, MES/SCADA, WMS, distributor portals, retailer
      POS) yields slow, error-prone S&OP handoffs and limited traceability.
    - >-
      Inventory buffers are set crudely, driving 10–20% excess finished goods
      and packaging materials while still missing service-level targets during
      peaks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Probabilistic demand forecasting at SKU–channel–region–week with exogenous
      signals (temperature anomalies, humidity/heat index, holidays,
      price/promos, events), producing prediction intervals and promo-lift
      factors.
    - >-
      MILP-based production plan orchestrator that transforms forecasts into
      feasible master schedules by plant, line, and shift, honoring speeds,
      changeover matrices, tank/storage, blow-mold vs. filler coupling, labor
      rosters, CIP/maintenance, packaging constraints.
    - >-
      Scenario studio: simulate heat waves by region, retailer promos, price
      changes, supply disruptions, and labor limits; compare service, cost,
      capacity utilization, and inventory outcomes side-by-side.
    - >-
      Dynamic safety-stock and buffer recommendations using service-level
      targets and forecast uncertainty; pushes targets to ERP/MRP.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: integrate plan adherence (schedule adherence, OTIF,
      changeover actuals) to continuously recalibrate models and constraints.
    - >-
      Rapid integration layer with ERP/MES/WMS and retailer/distributor feeds;
      data quality scoring and automated anomaly resolution workflow.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From forecast to feasible plan: weekly SKU/channel probabilistic forecasts
    automatically converted to a constraint-aware master production schedule by
    line and shift—purpose-built for bottled water’s weather spikes and promo
    volatility—delivering higher service with lower inventory and fewer
    changeovers in under 8 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Beverage-specific forecasting features fused with a constraint library for
    bottled water (heat-index lift models, blow-molder/filler coupling, tank and
    CIP constraints) and a rapid deployment method that produces an auditable,
    feasible line/shift plan in under 60 minutes—bridging the common gap between
    demand forecasts and executable schedules. Continuous learning from plan
    adherence and promo outcomes further sharpens accuracy over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Bottled water plant managers, schedulers, and supply chain leaders who want
    accurate weekly SKU/channel demand and a feasible plan by line and shift.
  problem: >-
    Volatile SKU/channel demand, heat-wave spikes, promos, and capacity
    constraints cause stockouts, overproduction, costly changeovers, and missed
    OTIF; leaders feel stuck firefighting with low confidence in the plan—water
    should be on shelf without waste.
  guide: >-
    We understand high-volume beverage operations and hot-week chaos. Our AI,
    trained on CPG seasonality, weather, and retail calendars, delivers
    trustworthy SKU/channel forecasts and finite-capacity production plans,
    validated in real plants.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP, POS, weather, and line data. 2) Auto-generate weekly
    SKU/channel forecasts with scenarios (heat waves, promos). 3) Convert to an
    executable master plan by line and shift with constraints and changeover
    logic; review, approve, and export to MES/ERP. Start with a pilot, keep
    humans-in-the-loop, and rely on SOC 2–grade security.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and start a 4-week pilot; or download the sample
    forecast/plan pack.
  success: >-
    Reliable on-shelf availability, calm weekly schedules, higher OTIF, fewer
    changeovers and overtime, better capacity utilization, and confident S&OP
    decisions.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting: empty shelves during heat spikes, excess inventory
    after promos, overtime burnout, expediting costs, missed SLAs, and eroded
    margins.
