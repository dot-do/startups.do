leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Demand is highly variable by season, weekday, weather, special events, and
      school/work calendars; manual planning leads to chronic
      over/under-capacity at route/time-slot level.
    - >-
      Crew constraints (USCG manning, hours-of-service/rest rules, union
      agreements) are difficult to respect while meeting peak demand, causing
      overtime and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Vessel assignment is typically static; assets are not re-optimized for
      river levels, dock constraints, maintenance windows, or fuel efficiency,
      resulting in low asset utilization and higher costs.
    - >-
      Short booking windows and walk-up ridership make it hard to forecast
      near-term demand; lack of reliable forecasts reduces revenue capture and
      service quality.
    - >-
      On-time performance is impacted by congestion at docks, weather and
      current, and suboptimal headways; there is no fast, data-driven way to
      re-time departures intra-day.
    - >-
      Operations teams rely on spreadsheets and legacy tools not designed for
      inland ferry constraints (draft, bridge openings, tidal/current impacts,
      wake limits, COI crew requirements).
    - >-
      Inadequate visibility of true load factors and missed turns leads to
      missed revenue opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Regulatory and safety constraints (COI-required crew composition,
      life-saving appliance capacity, maximum passengers, navigation limits) are
      not embedded into optimization logic, increasing compliance risk.
    - >-
      Fuel and emissions reduction targets are rising; operators need to
      minimize fuel per passenger-km without degrading service.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ticketing, AIS/GPS, maintenance, weather, events)
      prevents integrated planning and continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multimodal data: ticketing/POS, AFC, reservations, AIS/GPS tracks,
      dock turn times, weather/river stage, events, school/work calendars,
      maintenance schedules.
    - >-
      ML demand forecasting at route x stop-pair x time-slice (5–15 min bins)
      with seasonality, holiday/event and weather features; produces short-term
      (0–72h) and medium-term (1–12 weeks) forecasts with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Optimization engine (mixed-integer programming + heuristics) generates
      vessel assignments, headways, and crew rosters honoring constraints: COI
      manning, hours-of-service/rest, vessel capacity/draft, dock slotting,
      maintenance, fuel caps, union rules.
    - >-
      Scenario planner/digital twin: run what-if analyses (e.g., special events,
      vessel out-of-service, river level changes) and compare cost, OTP, load
      factor, emissions.
    - >-
      Real-time dispatcher assist: intraday demand sensing and re-optimization
      with push suggestions to add/cancel trips, up/down-gauge vessels, or swap
      crews within constraints.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: embedded USCG rules templates and configurable
      local/union rules; pre-deployment validation reports.
    - >-
      Integrations: APIs/connectors to ticketing (e.g., Masabi,
      Square/FareHarbor-class), maritime ops (e.g., Helm CONNECT-class),
      CAD/AVL, weather (NOAA-class), AIS providers; export GTFS-Flex/GTFS-RT for
      public info systems.
    - >-
      Operational dashboards: forecast accuracy, OTP, load factor by trip, crew
      overtime, deadhead time, fuel per passenger-km, CO2e.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: post-day reconciliation of actuals vs plan to
      auto-tune models and update cost parameters (turn times, dwell, speed
      profiles).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI that forecasts route- and departure-level demand and
    auto-generates compliant vessel, crew, and frequency plans—reducing overtime
    and fuel 10–20%, improving load factors 5–10 points, and boosting on-time
    performance 2–5 points within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization and forecasting stack encoded with inland
    passenger maritime constraints (COI/crew rest, draft/river stage, dock
    slotting), reinforced by proprietary route-level elasticities and turn-time
    profiles gathered through pilots—creating a data and model moat that
    generalist transit tools and legacy maritime ERPs lack.
