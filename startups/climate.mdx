  problem:
    - >-
      Energy costs are volatile and often >30–50% of total operating expenses in
      heated greenhouses; growers lack tools to proactively co-optimize climate
      and energy under day-ahead price uncertainty.
    - >-
      Manual setpoint selection (temperature, VPD, CO2, ventilation, light)
      relies on grower heuristics and siloed software, leading to inconsistent
      outcomes and setpoint drift across zones and shifts.
    - >-
      Growers must balance competing objectives: yield, quality, and energy
      cost—without a transparent, quantified way to trade these off over 24–72
      hours.
    - >-
      Limited integration between climate computers, weather forecasts, and
      energy price signals prevents dynamic schedules that pre-heat/pre-cool or
      shift loads to cheaper periods.
    - >-
      CO2 dosing and VPD management are under-optimized; over-ventilation dumps
      CO2, while under-ventilation harms disease risk and transpiration balance.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized KPIs (kWh per kg, cost per kg, CO2e per kg) and M&V
      methods makes it hard to prove ROI or qualify for utility incentives.
    - >-
      Staffing constraints—fewer experienced growers per hectare—create a need
      for decision support that is fast, explainable, and safe.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate to existing climate computers and sensors; ingest weather and
      day-ahead energy prices to produce optimized temperature, VPD, CO2,
      ventilation, and light setpoints for the next 24–72 hours.
    - >-
      Site-specific digital twin calibrated per crop, greenhouse construction,
      and equipment (heating pipes, curtains, ventilation, CO2 dosing,
      LEDs/HPS).
    - >-
      Model predictive control (MPC)-inspired optimizer with safety constraints,
      disease-risk guards, and grower-defined priorities (yield, quality, cost,
      carbon).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow—suggested setpoints are explainable, editable,
      and schedulable; lockouts for critical phases (flowering, harvest).
    - >-
      Scenario planner compares baseline vs. optimization vs. different
      price/forecast scenarios, quantifying expected kWh, m³ gas, kg CO2, and
      €/$ savings.
    - >-
      Automated measurement and verification (M&V) to attribute savings against
      weather- and production-normalized baselines and support utility
      incentives.
    - >-
      A/B and gradual rollout tooling—apply in specific zones/periods and expand
      as confidence grows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Forecast-aware, human-in-the-loop setpoint optimization that co-optimizes
    yield vs. energy cost over the next 24–72 hours—integrated with your climate
    computer—targeting 10–25% energy cost reduction with 0–5% yield lift,
    deployable in 2–4 weeks with auditable savings.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated, cross-crop digital-twin and optimizer library plus certified
    integrations with major climate computers, enabling fast deployment and
    transparent M&V. The growing, multi-region dataset of price-aware climate
    responses creates compounding model advantages that new entrants cannot
    quickly replicate.

  character: >-
    Greenhouse growers and operations managers (NAICS 111419) producing leafy
    greens, herbs, cucumbers, peppers, and strawberries who want reliable yields
    at the lowest possible energy cost.
  problem: >-
    Energy prices swing and climate control is complex; guessing
    temperature/VPD/CO2/ventilation/light setpoints risks either wasted energy
    or lost yield, causing stress, missed orders, and thin margins—growing food
    shouldn’t require burning extra energy to ‘hope’ the climate is right.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of hitting yield windows under volatile energy
    costs; our team blends horticulture, control systems, and AI to propose
    data-driven setpoints, built with commercial growers and compatible with
    leading climate computers.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect climate computer, meters, tariffs, weather, and crop targets; 2)
    Set goals and guardrails (yield window, comfort bands, equipment limits); 3)
    Approve the AI’s 24–72h setpoint plan and auto-apply with override and
    fail-safe to your current strategy.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo to see your crops’ setpoint plan; start a 4‑week pilot
    in one zone; optionally download a sample schedule and run an ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Hit target yields with less energy per kg, steadier orders, fewer alarms,
    and a smaller CO2 footprint—freeing your team from constant tweaking and
    strengthening margins.
  failure: >-
    Keep overpaying for heat and power, stressing crops, missing harvest
    windows, wasting CO2, and losing sleep over setpoints while more efficient
    growers pull ahead.

  problem:
    - Energy prices and weather swing hourly; manual setpoints waste money.
    - Uniform setpoints ignore crop and growth-stage needs.
    - CO2 dosing fights ventilation; losses spike on windy days.
    - Lighting misses DLI or pays peak tariffs.
    - Humidity control risks disease or over-venting.
    - Data is scattered; tuning consumes grower time.
    - No clear ROI from climate decisions.
  solution:
    - Optimal 24–72h setpoints per zone and crop stage.
    - 'Uses forecasts, tariffs, DLI, and CO2 cost.'
    - Slider to balance yield vs. energy spend.
