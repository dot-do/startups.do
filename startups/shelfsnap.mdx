  title: Shelf-Photo Inventory Reconciliation & Auto-Reorder
  description: >-
    Computer-vision + POS-driven workflow that flags outs, mis-shelved items,
    and drafts POs to vendors.
  targetUsers:
    - Store owners
    - Inventory managers
  triggers:
    - Weekly inventory check
    - Low-stock threshold crossed
    - New vendor shipment received
  inputs:
    - Shelf photos of bays/bolts/pegs
    - POS on-hand and sales history
    - Min/Max or days-of-cover rules
    - Vendor lead times and MOQs
    - SKU catalog with barcodes
  steps:
    - >-
      Agent validates photo quality and runs OCR/vision to read labels/barcodes
      and detect empty facings
    - Matches detected SKUs to catalog and reconciles with POS on-hand
    - >-
      Forecasts weeks-of-cover using recent sales and seasonality; applies
      min/max rules
    - >-
      Flags anomalies (e.g., shelf shows stock but POS says 0, possible
      misplacement)
    - Drafts vendor-specific purchase orders grouped by supplier and lead time
    - Routes low-confidence items to human for quick review/approval
    - Pushes approved POs to email/EDI and updates a Google Sheet dashboard
  tools:
    - GPT-4o or Azure Vision for OCR and object detection
    - Shopify/Square/Lightspeed POS APIs
    - BigQuery/Sheets
    - Simple forecasting (Prophet/XGBoost)
    - Email/EDI (Orderful or CSV via email)
  outputs:
    - Draft POs (CSV/PDF) per vendor
    - Stockout-risk report and anomaly list
    - Updated min/max recommendations dashboard
  pricingModel:
    - Monthly subscription per location
    - Usage fee per processed photo batch
    - Optional performance bonus for reduced stockouts

  risks:
    - OCR misreads causing wrong orders
    - POS sync latency leading to duplicates
    - Vendor MOQs/lead-time changes not captured
  dependencies:
    - Reliable POS/API access
    - Consistent photo protocol and lighting
    - Up-to-date vendor catalogs and SKU mappings

  problem:
    - >-
      Chronic shelf-POS mismatches lead to 1–4% lost sales from outs,
      mis-shelves, and phantom inventory in specialty sewing and piece-goods
      retail.
    - >-
      Manual cycle counts are labor-intensive (4–12 hrs/week/location) and
      inconsistent, especially with long-tail SKUs (colors, dye lots, trims).
    - >-
      POS reorder points rely on inaccurate on-hand data and do not account for
      shelf reality, causing stockouts of fast movers and overstock of slow
      movers.
    - >-
      Fragmented vendor catalogs and pack-size rules make reordering cumbersome;
      owners spend 3–6 hrs/week aggregating POs across vendors.
    - >-
      Visual complexity (similar colorways, brand-specific packaging, bolt-end
      labels) makes barcode-only workflows fragile; many items lack scannable
      facings on-shelf.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile shelf-sweep app: Staff capture each bay with guided photo frames;
      optional QR shelf/bay tags for fast mapping.
    - >-
      Computer vision tuned for sewing/piece-goods: Detects bolt-end labels,
      thread/spool facings, notion carding; OCR for SKU/UPC/brand/line;
      fine-grained colorway matching with confidence scores.
    - >-
      POS-driven reconciliation: Matches visual counts vs POS on-hand; flags
      outs, low facings, and suspected mis-shelves by bay/slot; generates
      discrepancy tasks.
    - >-
      Auto-reorder drafting: Combines sales velocity, lead time, vendor
      MOQs/pack sizes, and min/max to draft vendor-grouped POs; supports
      alternates for discontinued SKUs.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: One-tap corrections, quick relabeling/printing, and
      variance explanations that sync back to POS.
    - >-
      Insights: Shelf heatmaps for high-velocity gaps, shrink signals, and
      overstock candidates; per-aisle accuracy and labor savings tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn quick shelf photos into accurate on-hand counts, mis-shelved alerts,
    and vendor-ready draft POs—cut cycle-count labor in half, reduce outs by
    25–40%, and recover 1–3% topline sales within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific vision dataset for sewing/piece-goods and enriched vendor
    catalogs, coupled with POS-native reconciliation and one-click vendor PO
    drafting. Network effects from aggregated SKU imagery and bay layouts
    continuously improve recognition and reorder recommendations.

  character: >-
    Owners, buyers, and floor managers at sewing, needlework, and piece goods
    retailers who want full, accurate shelves and effortless reordering.
  problem: >-
    - External: Outs, mis-shelved items, POS mismatches, and slow manual counts
    cause lost sales and messy shelves.

    - Internal: Frustration from guessing what to reorder, stress during rushes,
    and distrust of on-hand data.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose a sale because your shelf and POS
    disagree—every customer should find the exact color, size, or notion they
    came for.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the chaos of thread towers, notions walls, and
    fast-moving SKUs.

    - Authority: Built by retail ops and computer-vision experts; POS-driven
    workflow that turns shelf photos into flagged fixes and draft POs; designed
    for specialty retailers.

    staff.

    - Risk-reversal: Start with one aisle; no long-term contract;
    month-to-month.
