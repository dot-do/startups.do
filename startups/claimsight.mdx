  problem:
    - >-
      Claims teams receive high-volume, multi-format documents from disparate
      sources such as email, fax, portals, and third-party providers that
      require manual sorting and data entry.
    - >-
      Manual triage and keying of police reports, estimates, invoices, and
      medical bills drives high average handling time, inconsistent data
      quality, and long cycle times.
    - >-
      Existing OCR and capture tools are generic, struggle with semi-structured
      insurance forms, and require brittle templates that break when layouts
      change.
    - >-
      Compliance, PHI/PII handling, and audit requirements increase process
      complexity and risk, especially when data passes through multiple vendors.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Claims VPs, operations leaders, and SIU/IT at Direct P&C carriers (NAICS
    524126) who need accurate, real-time data from claim documents to speed
    settlements and control LAE.
  problem: >-
    - external: Unstructured claim docs (police reports, repair estimates,
    invoices, medical bills) arrive via email/portals; manual indexing and data
    entry; inconsistent formats across jurisdictions and vendors.

    - internal: Teams are overburdened; backlogs grow; SLAs slip; adjusters
    don’t trust the data.

    - philosophical: Policyholders deserve fast, fair claims without paperwork
    friction; carriers should make decisions, not retype data.

    - stakes: Indemnity leakage, missed subrogation/fraud indicators, compliance
    exposure, higher LAE.
  guide: >-
    - empathy: We understand the chaos of claim documents—from unreadable faxes
    to 200-page PDFs—and how it drags on cycle time and morale.

    - authority: Insurance-native AI tuned for P&C artifacts; field-level
    extraction with confidence scores; human-in-the-loop review; audit trails;
    SOC 2–aligned security and PHI/PII handling; production-proven APIs and
    references available.
  plan: >-
    - process: 1) Connect sources (email, SFTP, ECM/core, portal) and define
    target fields by LOB. 2) Calibrate on historical samples; validate
    accuracy/routing; set confidence thresholds and review queues. 3) Go live
    via API/webhooks; monitor dashboards; iterate via feedback.

    - agreement: Clear SLAs; simple subscription + usage pricing; data residency
    options; no customer data used for broad training; export/delete on request.
  callToAction: >-
    - direct: Book a 30-minute demo and send 20 sample docs for a free fit
    assessment.

    - transitional: Download the Claims Document Readiness Checklist and API
    Quickstart.
  success: |-
    - Meaningfully shorter cycle times from FNOL to settlement
    - Lower LAE via automation and fewer re-keys
    - Higher straight-through processing and accurate triage
    - Cleaner data for better reserving and reporting
    - Audit-ready traceability and stronger compliance posture
    - Adjusters focused on decisions, not data entry
    - Improved policyholder and agent experience
    - More consistent subrogation and fraud referrals
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing manual keying, backlogs, and SLA misses
    - Data errors causing rework and leakage
    - Compliance findings and audit risk
    - Adjuster burnout and turnover
    - Slower settlements and dissatisfied policyholders
