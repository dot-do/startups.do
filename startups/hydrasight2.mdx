leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unstructured EOL test data (PDFs/CSVs/DAq logs) consumes 2–6 minutes/test
      for manual review and data entry, creating bottlenecks at daily volumes of
      200–1,000 tests per plant.
    - >-
      Inconsistent KPI computation (e.g., volumetric/mechanical efficiency,
      leakage, pressure ripple) leads to 3–8% false fails or escapes due to unit
      mismatches, sampling rate differences, and misapplied spec limits.
    - >-
      NCRs are opened late or routed incorrectly; median NCR cycle time is 3–7
      days with 20–40% ping-pong between Quality, Test, and Assembly.
    - >-
      Root-cause triage is tribal-knowledge dependent; loss of senior
      technicians increases investigation time by 30–60 minutes/NCR and raises
      repeat issues.
    - >-
      No closed-loop from test results to QMS/MES; weak auditability for ISO
      9001/IATF 16949/AS9100 during PPAP/FAI runs and customer audits.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest raw test outputs from DAQ/PLC/CSV/PDF and normalize units/sampling
      into a canonical schema.
    - >-
      Compute domain KPIs: volumetric/mechanical efficiency, case drain flow,
      leakage rates, pressure ripple, temperature rise, noise, torque-speed
      curves, valve hysteresis.
    - >-
      Apply spec packs by part/revision/fixture; decide pass/fail with
      explainable rules + ML-based anomaly detection for borderline cases.
    - >-
      Auto-summarize test run and open NCRs for nonconforming units with likely
      root-cause classification and routing to responsible cell/team.
    - >-
      Sync results bi-directionally with QMS/MES/ERP (e.g., SAP QM, Plex, ETQ)
      and maintain audit-ready traceability and electronic signatures.
    - >-
      Provide live dashboards, SPC, alerting, and model/rule governance (change
      control, approvals, versioning).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate EOL report normalization, KPI computation, pass/fail decisions, and
    NCR triage—cut NCR cycle time by 50%, reduce false failures by 60%, and lift
    first-pass yield 3–7% with auditable, domain-specific AI that runs at the
    edge or on-prem.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary hydraulics-specific KPI/limits library and labeled triage
    dataset collected via integrator/OEM partnerships; validated connectors to
    dominant test benches; audit-grade decisioning with explainability tailored
    to fluid power—difficult for generic AI or horizontal IIoT platforms to
    replicate quickly.

  character: >-
    Quality, Test, and Operations leaders at fluid power pump and motor
    manufacturers (NAICS 333996) who need fast, accurate EOL decisions to keep
    takt, protect customers, and control cost of quality.
  problem: >-
    Disparate raw test files and inconsistent limits force manual review;
    pass/fail calls are late or inconsistent; NCRs languish in inboxes; KPIs are
    hidden—driving delays, escapes, rework, and audit pain.
  guide: >-
    We understand hydraulics EOL and ISO-driven quality. Our AI normalizes bench
    outputs, applies domain rules for pressure/flow/leakage/efficiency, and
    integrates with MES/QMS/ERP—securely on‑prem or in your VPC.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect test stands and data stores. 2) Configure normalization, KPIs,
    and pass/fail rules. 3) Pilot on one product family in shadow mode to
    validate. 4) Go live: auto-summarize reports, decide pass/fail, and
    open/route NCRs with dashboards and alerts. Low-risk, fixed-scope pilot;
    cancel anytime.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30‑minute demo or start a 30‑day pilot.
  success: >-
    Instant, audit-ready test summaries; consistent pass/fail; automatic NCR
    creation and routing; faster closure; higher FPY and OEE; fewer escapes;
    on-time shipments; lower cost of quality.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: slow decisions, NCR backlog, missed ship dates, repeat
    defects, warranty exposure, and tough audits.

  problem:
    - >-
      Raw EOL reports live in CSVs, PDFs, and screenshots—hard to trust or
      reuse.
    - Engineers spend hours parsing plots and deciding pass/fail by hand.
    - 'Spec checks vary by person, shift, and product revision.'
    - 'NCRs open late or route to the wrong owners, slowing containment.'
    - Traceability from test plan to serial number is fragmented.
    - 'Late decisions drive rework, WIP buildup, and missed ship dates.'
    - Audits stall on missing evidence and inconsistent rationale.
  solution:
    - 'Normalize raw test data into a clean, searchable model.'
    - >-
      Compute KPIs per test plan: flow, pressure, leakage, efficiency,
      temperature, noise, torque.
    - 'Apply limits and tolerances by part number, customer, and revision.'
    - Auto pass/fail with reason codes and highlighted out-of-bounds steps.
    - >-
      Open NCRs with prefilled context; route to Quality, ME, Test, or Supplier
      Quality.
    - Notify via Teams/Email and track SLA to closure.
    - >-
      Deliver concise summaries for operators and deep drill-downs for
      engineers.
    - Maintain full traceability and an auditable decision trail.

      ramp segments.
    - KPI library and custom formulas with unit normalization (metric/imperial).
    - >-
      Rules engine for pass/fail: spec bands, guard bands, hysteresis,
      multi-step sequences.
    - >-
      Variant management: limits by PN/rev/customer and test plan version
      control.
    - 'Anomaly and drift detection across lots, lines, and shifts.'

      timers.
    - >-
      Integrations via API/webhooks to QMS/ERP/MES (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Plex,
      Epicor, Arena).
    - >-

      units.
    - >-
      Enterprise-grade security: encryption in transit/at rest and granular
      permissions.
  steps:
    - Connect your test stand data sources and sample reports.
    - 'Map fields to the canonical schema (PN, serial, plan rev, units).'
    - Import spec limits and tolerances per part and revision.
    - Validate on historical runs; tune KPIs and rules with engineers.
    - 'Go live: auto summarize results, decide pass/fail, and open/route NCRs.'
    - 'Monitor dashboards, adjust thresholds, and lock workflows for audit.'
    - 'Scale to additional lines, products, and plants.'
