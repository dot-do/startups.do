  problem:
    - >-
      Advisors and portfolio ops teams spend 5–20 hours per rebalance cycle per
      household aggregating data, validating IPS constraints, modeling tax
      impacts, and creating custodian-ready trade files.
    - >-
      Existing rebalancers are rules-based and struggle with complex IPS
      constraints (e.g., household-level targets, ESG prohibitions, factor/TE
      bands, tax-budgeting across accounts), leading to manual overrides and
      compliance risk.
    - >-
      Tax drag from suboptimal rebalancing and poor tax-lot selection commonly
      costs 30–100 bps annually in taxable accounts.
    - >-
      Trade files frequently fail custodian validation (formatting, rounding,
      lot IDs), causing rework and potential trade delays or errors.
    - >-
      Advisors lack defensible, client-friendly explanations for rebalancing
      rationales and estimated after-tax outcomes, hindering client adoption.
    - >-
      Integration gaps with custodians, PMS/portfolio accounting systems (Orion,
      Tamarac, Addepar, Black Diamond), and CRMs create swivel-chair workflows
      and data integrity issues.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests IPS documents and account metadata to auto-derive constraints
      (allocation targets/ranges, ESG exclusions, factor/TE bands, turnover,
      cash buffers, security/position limits).
    - >-
      Optimization engine generates household-level, tax-aware proposals
      (lot-level sells, gain/loss budgets, wash sale avoidance, short/long-term
      gain prioritization) with scenario comparisons and estimated after-tax
      outcomes.
    - >-
      One-click creation of custodian-ready trade files (FIX, CSV,
      custodian-specific formats) including blocks, allocations, rounding,
      min-trade checks, and pre-trade compliance.
    - >-
      Explainability layer that produces advisor- and client-facing rationale:
      what changed, why trades occur, tax impact (bps/$), and IPS adherence
      proofs.
    - >-
      Real-time data sync with PMS/portfolio accounting systems and custodians;
      drift monitoring, trade exceptions handling, and post-trade
      reconciliation.
    - >-
      Audit-ready logs, policies, and evidence for compliance (who approved,
      constraints used, rule checks, T+N execution outcomes).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Tax-aware, IPS-compliant rebalancing with explainable AI that turns complex
    household constraints into executable, custodian-ready trade lists in
    minutes—measurably reducing tax drag and operational load.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    IPS-to-constraints automation plus explainable, tax-aware household
    optimization with custodian-certified trade generation and audited
    compliance proofs—validated on real client datasets to deliver quantifiable
    tax alpha and ops efficiency. Data network effects from aggregated,
    anonymized tax-lot outcomes improve models over time.
