  problem:
    - >-
      Energy costs for firing are volatile and high: natural gas/electricity can
      represent 15–35% of COGS; many plants lack real-time optimization to
      reduce MMBtu/ton.
    - >-
      First-pass yield (FPY) is sensitive to firing profiles; scrap/rework
      (cracks, warpage, under/over-fired pieces) often runs 3–10%, driven by
      non-optimal ramp/soak and kiln loading patterns.
    - >-
      Expert recipe tuning is tribal knowledge; when experts retire or product
      mix changes, performance drifts and is slow to recover.
    - >-
      Kiln-to-kiln variability (thermal mass, leakage, instrumentation bias)
      makes “one recipe fits all” impractical; per-kiln optimization is rarely
      feasible manually.
    - >-
      Constraints (max ramp rate, soak durations, dew point for drying,
      temperature uniformity, emissions limits) must be honored; most systems
      lack optimization under hard constraints.
    - >-
      Scheduling pressures force suboptimal trade-offs between throughput,
      energy, and quality, with limited visibility of true cost/yield impact.
    - >-
      Limited sensing and data fragmentation (PLC/SCADA logs, QA lab data,
      maintenance logs) prevent closed-loop learning from historical runs.
    - >-
      Plants face increasing GHG and reporting requirements; few have granular,
      per-kiln CO2e intensity baselines or reduction levers tied to firing
      curves.
  solution:
    - >-
      Build a physics-informed ML model (digital twin) per kiln-product
      combination using historical SCADA/PLC traces, QA outcomes, and kiln
      specs.
    - >-
      Use a constrained optimizer (multi-objective: energy, yield, throughput)
      to generate ramp/soak profiles that respect max/min temperature, ramp
      rates, dew point limits, soak times, thermal gradients, and emissions
      constraints.
    - >-
      Deploy an edge agent that streams setpoint recommendations or profiles to
      existing DCS/PLC recipe managers; option for closed-loop MPC or
      operator-in-the-loop mode.
    - >-
      Provide an offline simulator to test proposed firing curves against
      historical variability before live trials; A/B trial tooling to compare
      energy/FPY outcomes on controlled batches.
    - >-
      Integrate energy pricing (time-of-use gas/electric), production schedule,
      and product mix to optimize when/how to fire for lowest cost and stable
      quality.
    - >-
      Deliver dashboards with KPIs (MMBtu/ton, kWh/ton, FPY, scrap costs,
      CO2e/ton), anomaly detection, drift alerts, and automatic re-optimization
      triggers.
    - >-
      Implement governance: hard safety envelopes, operator override, change
      logs, and sign-off workflows aligned with plant procedures.
    - >-
      Offer playbooks and on-site enablement for curve validation, loading
      pattern adjustments, and thermocouple calibration to lock in gains.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-optimized, constraint-safe firing curves per product and per kiln that
    cut energy 5–12% and improve FPY 1–2% within 90 days—without replacing
    existing controls—delivering sub-6‑month payback and auditable CO2e
    reduction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-kiln dataset and physics-informed models specialized for
    clay and refractories enable faster, safer optimization than generic energy
    tools; edge integrations with existing DCS/PLCs reduce friction; A/B trial
    tooling and audited M&V build trust and unlock utility incentives and
    performance-based pricing.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers, process engineers, and kiln supervisors in clay building
    materials and refractories (NAICS 327120) who want stable quality, lower
    energy per ton, and predictable throughput from every kiln.
  problem: >-
    - External: Energy volatility, raw mix/moisture variability, kiln-to-kiln
    differences, manual curve tuning, and strict ramp/soak and emissions limits.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting and fear of scrapping a firing; reliance
    on tribal knowledge; night-shift guesswork.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between quality, cost, and
    delivery—firing curves should be data-driven, safe, and repeatable.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run kilns and built controls—we know one missed soak can crack a
    month’s production. Our team blends kiln engineering with AI, proven across
    tunnel, shuttle, and periodic kilns. We honor safety and compliance
    (ramp/soak, change control) and integrate with your SCADA/MES/ERP.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Import kiln logs, product specs, and constraints via API/CSV;
    set safety limits and approvals.

    2) Optimize: AI proposes kiln- and product-specific curves that minimize
    energy and defects while honoring ramp/soak; simulate and review together.

    3) Deploy & learn: Trial on a line, push to operators/PLC with rollback,
    monitor KPIs, and continuously improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on one kiln. Transitional: Book a 30-minute demo or
    upload last month’s logs for a free firing audit and ROI estimate.
  success: |-
    • 5–12% lower energy per fired ton and reduced CO2
    • 10–25% fewer defects (cracks, warpage, over/underfire)
    • Tighter cycles and predictable throughput; less operator tweaking
    • Standardized, documented curves that retain tribal knowledge
    • Confident delivery performance and happier customers
  failure: >-
    Without this, you keep overpaying for energy, chasing variability with
    manual tweaks, scrapping batches, missing ship dates, risking compliance
    issues, and losing know-how as veterans retire.
