leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Highly variable, intermittent SKU demand (made-to-order + made-to-stock
      mix) causes 25–45% MAPE at weekly level, driving excess inventory and
      chronic stockouts.
    - >-
      Product-mix uncertainty (colors, widths, finishes) leads to frequent
      changeovers, suboptimal dye/loom schedules, and poor capacity utilization
      (often <75% planned vs actual).
    - >-
      Material planning is reactive; lead times and supplier reliability vary,
      causing 5–12% stockouts on key yarns/chemicals and high expedite costs.
    - >-
      Safety stock and reorder points are static or rule-of-thumb, not
      service-level optimized; inventory turns stagnate at 3–5x while desired is
      6–8x.
    - >-
      ERP/MRP forecasts are generic; planners spend 30–50% of time cleansing
      data, reconciling overrides, and firefighting with sales/ops.
    - >-
      Seasonality, promotions, and customer-specific programs aren’t modeled,
      causing bias and missed OTIF targets (often <92%).
  solution:
    - >-
      Implement a textile-specific forecasting engine combining hierarchical
      time series, intermittent-demand models (Croston/SBA), and machine
      learning for mix (color/finish/width) at weekly/monthly horizons.
    - >-
      Generate service-level-optimized safety stocks and reorder points using
      supplier lead-time variability, MOQs, and dye/loom batch constraints;
      support multi-echelon inventory (plant/DC).
    - >-
      Provide what-if simulations for promotions, MOQ changes, supplier
      lead-time scenarios, and capacity constraints (loom/dye machine calendars,
      setup matrices).
    - >-
      Deliver automated MRP-ready recommendations (planned orders/transfers) via
      connectors to ERP; surface exceptions and planner workflows (e.g.,
      stockout risk in 2 weeks).
    - >-
      Pilot approach: 8–12 weeks to baseline current KPIs, integrate 24–36
      months of history, validate models, and quantify ROI; then full rollout
      with S&OP dashboards.
    - >-
      Offer a managed forecasting service option (monthly model tuning,
      seasonality refresh, parameter governance) for teams with limited analyst
      capacity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut stockouts by 25–40% and reduce working-capital tied in inventory by
    10–20% within 6 months by delivering SKU- and material-level demand/mix
    forecasts plus service-level-optimized safety stocks and reorder points
    purpose-built for textile mills.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific forecasting and policy engine tuned to textile constraints
    (dye/loom batch realities, roll-width yields, intermittent demand), plus
    prebuilt ERP connectors and an anonymized benchmarking dataset from
    mills—enabling faster pilots (8–12 weeks), lower TCO, and measurable results
    within a quarter.

    Planners and supply leaders at All Other Miscellaneous Textile Product Mills
    who want reliable weekly/monthly SKU and key‑material forecasts so they can
    hit OTIF with less inventory and disruption.
  problem: >-
    Volatile mix across styles, sizes, and colorways; long supplier and
    dye‑house lead times; and spreadsheet planning create stockouts on fast
    movers and excess on slow movers. Capacity constraints and MOQs make the
    wrong buys costly. You need clear, defensible safety stocks and reorder
    points.
  guide: >-
    We’re a textile‑savvy AI planning partner. We pair mill operations know‑how
    with machine learning to capture seasonality, promos, and capacity
    realities—explaining recommendations in plain language and integrating with
    your ERP/MES.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: pull historical shipments, orders, BOMs, lead times, and
    calendars. 2) Model: generate weekly/monthly SKU and key‑material forecasts;
    size safety stocks and reorder points by target service levels. 3) Deploy:
    dashboards and alerts, ERP upload, planner training. 4) Run: weekly refresh,
    S&OP review, continuous improvement.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute assessment. Transitional: Start a 6‑week pilot
    to receive sample forecasts and safety‑stock sizing from your data.
  success: >-
    Right‑sized inventories with targeted service levels; smoother changeovers
    and capacity plans; fewer expedites; faster, confident buys on yarns, trims,
    and dyes; higher OTIF and margin; freed working capital.
  failure: >-
    Another season of firefighting—missed ship dates, costly overtime,
    write‑offs on dead stock, frustrated customers, and cash trapped in the
    wrong SKUs.
