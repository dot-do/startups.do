  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers spend 30–90 minutes building each submittal binder (SDS,
      ICC-ES/ESR, spec sheets, product approvals) by hunting across manufacturer
      sites and PDFs; the process is error-prone and non-standardized.
    - >-
      Rejected submittals and code noncompliance cause schedule delays and
      chargebacks; dealers lack in-house spec/code expertise to validate
      assemblies for specific jurisdictions.
    - >-
      Local code variations (e.g., Florida Product Approvals, Miami-Dade NOA,
      state/municipal amendments to IBC/IECC/IFC) are hard to track and
      frequently change.
    - >-
      Sales reps and counter staff turnover leads to inconsistent branding and
      documentation quality; managers have little visibility into submittal
      cycle time, acceptance rates, and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP/POS (quotes), shared drives, email, and
      manufacturer portals; there’s no audit trail or version control on what
      was submitted for which job.
    - >-
      Commercial GC platforms (Procore, Autodesk Build) manage submittal
      workflow but don’t automate content assembly for dealers or check local
      code compliance.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven Submittal Builder: ingest a quote/PO or product list,
      auto-collect latest SDS, ICC-ES/ESR, FL/NOA approvals, spec sheets, and
      generate a branded PDF binder with cover, TOC, bookmarks.
    - >-
      CodeCheck engine: select project jurisdiction; system checks assemblies
      and SKUs against relevant local codes, approvals, fire/energy
      requirements, and highlights gaps with cited sections and approved
      alternatives.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction Intelligence: maintained library of IBC/IRC, state
      amendments, IECC, WUI, seismic/wind, FL Product Approval, Miami-Dade NOA,
      UL/Intertek listings mapped to assemblies common to dealers.
    - >-
      ERP/POS integrations (Epicor BisTrack/Eclipse, DMSi Agility, ECI Spruce,
      NetSuite) to pull quotes and push final submittals back into job files.
    - >-
      Reviewer-ready exports: binders in GC-preferred format (Procore/Autodesk),
      with transmittals, revision history, and auto-fill cover sheets by
      project.
    - >-
      Governance & analytics: branch-level templates, approval workflows, audit
      trails, KPI dashboards (time-to-submittal, acceptance rate, code issues
      found).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Create branded, code-ready submittal packages in minutes and automatically
    validate your assemblies against local codes and product approvals—reducing
    rejections, accelerating quotes-to-award, and standardizing quality across
    branches.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A dealer-focused code and product-approval graph that links specific SKUs
    and common assemblies to jurisdictional requirements, combined with deep
    ERP/POS integrations and a continuously updated manufacturer document
    network. Over time, anonymized acceptance outcomes create a feedback loop
    that improves recommendation accuracy and raises switching costs.

    - Step 3: Review, export (PDF/ZIP), and submit to GC/AHJ; track versions and
    updates.

    - Agreement: Clear version control, role-based approvals, audit trail, and
    change notifications for code updates.
