  problem:
    - >-
      Forecast accuracy at SKU-week level is poor (typical MAPE 25–40%) due to
      SKU proliferation by width, gauge, color, and additive recipes, leading to
      frequent stockouts of niche SKUs and overstock of fast-movers.
    - >-
      Resin price and availability are volatile (monthly price swings of 5–15%
      and force majeure risks), while procurement relies on fixed reorder points
      and spreadsheets that ignore lead-time variability and supplier allocation
      constraints.
    - >-
      Long and lumpy resin lead times (3–10 weeks) and high MOQs (20,000–80,000
      lbs) cause excess working capital or shortages; safety stocks are set
      heuristically, not to a target service level.
    - >-
      Planning is disconnected: demand plans don’t translate to resin buy plans
      that reflect BOMs, grade substitutions, scrap/yield, machine capacity, and
      changeover costs.
    - >-
      Expedites and downtime: frequent resin-related changeovers, last-minute PO
      changes, and line stoppages cause 1–3% throughput loss and increased
      labor/freight costs.
    - >-
      No structured approach to hedging/index-linked contracts; buyers lack
      decision support to split volumes across suppliers, terms, and indices to
      minimize total cost/risk.
    - >-
      ERP/MRP systems (SAP, Infor, Epicor, MS Dynamics) lack industry-specific
      logic for extrusion grade equivalence, color masterbatch co-usage, and
      die-width/trim constraints.
    - >-
      Finance lacks forward visibility of resin cash needs and price variance;
      procurement performance isn’t measured with objective KPIs (bias, service
      level, turn rate, plan adherence).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI forecasting at SKU-week level with hierarchical reconciliation (family
      → gauge → width/color → SKU) and feature engineering for seasonality,
      promotions, customer programs, and macro indicators (construction/ag
      demand proxies).
    - >-
      Resin buy-plan optimizer that translates demand into resin requirements
      using BOMs, yield/scrap, grade equivalence, and supplier constraints;
      solves an MIP to meet service-level targets at minimum total cost (price,
      carrying, changeover, expedite).
    - >-
      Safety stock optimization per SKU and resin grade to target service levels
      (95–99.5%) given demand/lead-time variability; computes reorder points
      dynamically.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and hedging advisor: simulate price trajectories,
      allocation risks, and split volumes across suppliers and contract types
      (spot, index-linked, fixed).
    - >-
      Capacity- and changeover-aware planning: respects extruder line rates, die
      widths, minimum run sizes, and changeover matrices to smooth resin
      consumption and reduce trim waste.
    - >-
      Integrated supplier scorecards and risk signals (lead-time drift, OTIF,
      outage alerts/weather events) to adjust plans proactively.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors for SAP, Infor, Epicor, and MS Dynamics; low-code data
      adapters; secure cloud or VPC deployment.
    - >-
      Explainable AI with bias tracking and planner overrides; closed-loop
      learning from forecast error, plan adherence, and realized consumption.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce resin working capital 15–30% and stockouts 40–60% by unifying
    SKU-level demand forecasting with constraint-aware resin buy-plan
    optimization purpose-built for unlaminated film and sheet operations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Industry-specific optimization IP (grade equivalence, die-width/changeover
    economics, yield learning) plus anonymized benchmarks of resin consumption
    and lead-time variability across unlaminated film/sheet manufacturers.
    Prebuilt ERP connectors and a scenario-based hedging advisor reduce
    time-to-value versus generic planning tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations/supply chain leader at an unlaminated plastics film & sheet
    manufacturer who must meet service targets while keeping resin inventory
    lean and cash flowing.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile SKU demand, long resin lead times/MOQs, and
    spreadsheet-driven planning cause stockouts or overbuys.

    Internal: Tired of firefighting, rush buys, and uncertainty about what to
    order and when.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to choose between service levels and
    working capital—resin decisions should be data-driven and predictable.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand resin-dependent production pressures—missed OTIF,
    idle lines, and carrying costs that erode margin.

    Authority: Built by supply chain and data science practitioners; proven in
    discrete/process manufacturing to improve forecast quality and procurement
    outcomes; integrates with common ERPs.
  plan: |-
    Process:
    - Connect ERP/MES, shipments, BOMs, and supplier data.
    - Generate SKU-level demand forecasts and simulate scenarios.
    - Produce optimal resin buy plans by grade/lead time/MOQ/safety stock.
    - Review, approve, and export to ERP for PO creation.
    Agreement:
    - Pilot-first with clear success metrics.
    - Data security and compliance; you own your data.
    - No disruption to production; month-to-month after pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a 4-week pilot.

    Transitional: Get the Resin Procurement Playbook and ROI calculator;
    subscribe to planning best-practice tips.
  success: >-
    Right-size resin inventory, fewer stockouts, higher OTIF, and less expedite
    freight. Confident buy decisions aligned to demand, better cash rotation,
    and stronger margins. Clear visibility from forecast to PO, improving trust
    across sales, planning, and procurement.
  failure: >-
    Status quo means recurring stockouts, costly rush buys, idle machines, and
    obsolete resin write-offs. Missed deliveries, strained customer
    relationships, and cash trapped in the wrong inventory—while exposure to
    price swings continues.
