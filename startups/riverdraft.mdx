leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Tow operators routinely under-load by 3–12 inches to avoid soft groundings
      because controlling depths along routes are uncertain and change quickly,
      leaving millions in foregone revenue annually.
    - >-
      Dispatchers and wheelhouse crews stitch together NOAA/USACE stage
      forecasts, notices to navigation, and anecdotal shoaling reports without a
      quantitative, route-specific under-keel clearance model.
    - >-
      Groundings and near-groundings cause delays, hull/prop damage, and
      insurance claims; a single soft grounding can cost $50,000–$500,000 in
      direct and indirect costs.
    - >-
      Terminals/elevators must make last-minute re-trims and partial loads due
      to evolving river stages, causing berth congestion and demurrage.
    - >-
      Existing ECS/TMS tools show charts and real-time gages but do not turn
      forecasted stages and bathymetry into actionable, per-barge draft and trim
      targets with quantified risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Route Controlling Depth Forecast: Fuse NOAA/NWS/USACE stage forecasts with
      latest channel surveys and shoaling reports to predict controlling depths
      by river mile and time window.
    - >-
      Per-barge Load & Trim Optimizer: Given tow makeup, barge types, and cargo,
      compute target drafts and trims per barge that maximize payload while
      meeting operator-defined risk tolerance (e.g., P(UKC<0.5 ft) < 1%).
    - >-
      Risk-quantified Plans: Output includes expected UKC distribution by reach,
      time-window routing recommendations, and contingency triggers (e.g., if
      Cairo stage < X ft, re-trim barge 7 by Y tons).
    - >-
      Terminal Assist: Provide terminal-facing targets for initial load,
      topping-off sequence, and cut timing to minimize berth time and rework.
    - >-
      Live Adjust: Update underway as stages and traffic evolve; push alerts for
      shoaling or forecast deltas that threaten plan validity.
    - >-
      APIs & Integrations: Embed into TMS/ECS for one-click plan import,
      AIS-aware ETA adjustments, and automated audit trails for
      insurers/regulators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Maximize tons per tow while keeping a documented under‑keel clearance
    buffer: stage-aware, route-specific load plans that convert forecasted river
    levels and channel bathymetry into per-barge draft and trim targets with
    probabilistic grounding risk, delivered directly into dispatch and
    wheelhouse workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset and models that continuously learn from partner fleets’
    plan-to-actual outcomes and optional onboard sonar, yielding
    corridor-specific controlling-depth forecasts and UKC risk estimates that
    competitors without this feedback cannot match; embedded OEM integrations
    and insurer-backed incentives further raise switching costs.

    Barge line operators, fleet managers, and loadmasters who want to maximize
    payload per tow while staying safely off the bottom.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: volatile river stages, shifting shoals, and uncertain channel
    depths

    - External: fluctuating drafts, patchy bathymetry, and changing lock/tow
    constraints complicate loading

    - Internal: guessing induces stress—fear of grounding or leaving tons on the
    dock

    - Philosophical: with today’s data, safe, optimal loading shouldn’t be a
    gamble
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: we understand over- or under-loading creates risk, delays, and
    disputes

    - Authority: Stage-Aware AI built by river engineers and data scientists;
    leverages NWS stage forecasts, USACE bathymetry, and vessel constraints;
    aligns with UKC best practices
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: connect lanes, gages, and barge specs via API or portal

    - Step 2: we simulate forecast stages against route bathymetry to compute
    per-barge drafts/trims and tow windows with clear UKC margins

    - Step 3: load with confidence; receive updated plans as forecasts change
    and export to terminals/dispatch
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: schedule a 30-minute demo and start a 2-week pilot on two lanes
    - Transitional: request a sample load plan for an upcoming voyage
  success: |-
    - Move more tons per trip while reducing grounding risk
    - Fewer delays, rehandles, and demurrage
    - Predictable ETAs and policy-aligned UKC margins
    - Higher asset utilization and revenue per barge
    - Confident, data-backed decisions for crews and customers
  failure: |-
    - Groundings, hull damage, and claims
    - Light-loading that leaves revenue on the dock
    - Emergency offloads and missed windows
    - Eroded customer trust and regulatory scrutiny

  problem:
    - River stages change fast; static loading rules leave money on the dock.
