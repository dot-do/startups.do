  problem:
    - >-
      Manual comparison of drawing revisions is slow and error-prone; teams miss
      subtle geometry, annotation, and spec changes that drive RFIs, change
      orders, and rework.
    - >-
      Existing compare tools (e.g., basic overlay/compare) highlight pixel
      differences but do not align sheets reliably across scales, rotations, or
      inconsistent title block locations, leading to false positives.
    - >-
      No automated, structured change log exists that tags changes by
      trade/discipline, CSI code, or sheet reference and routes them to
      responsible parties with due dates.
    - >-
      Document controllers and PMs spend 20–60 person-hours per major revision
      set to organize deltas, email distributions, and track acknowledgments,
      with minimal auditability.
    - >-
      Owners and insurers lack traceable evidence that revision changes were
      reviewed and acknowledged by all impacted trades, increasing risk.
    - >-
      Field teams receive late or incomplete communication about drawing
      changes, causing out-of-date work in place and schedule slippage.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered sheet alignment that corrects for scale, rotation, and drift
      using feature matching on geometry and title blocks.
    - >-
      Semantic change extraction that distinguishes geometry vs. annotation vs.
      spec note changes; thresholds tuneable to project tolerance.
    - >-
      Automated trade/discipline mapping via sheet index parsing, CSI
      MasterFormat, layers, and NLP over notes/callouts to assign
      responsibilities.
    - >-
      Structured change logs (CSV/JSON/PDF) with sheet references, snapshots,
      change categories, severity, and due dates; routed via email and within
      integrated platforms.
    - >-
      Bidirectional integrations with Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud
      (Build/Docs), Bluebeam Studio, and Newforma for sheet sync and
      distribution.
    - >-
      Review workflow with bulk triage, accept/reject, merge, @mentions, and
      acknowledgment tracking for an auditable trail.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard showing cycle time, changes per discipline, high-risk
      areas, and RFI correlation.
    - API/SDK for enterprise automation and embedding in PMO workflows.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automatically align and compare drawing revisions, extract and classify true
    design changes, and deliver a structured, auditable change log routed to
    each responsible trade—cutting review time by 70%+ and reducing missed
    changes that lead to RFIs and rework.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus of annotated revision deltas across building
    types, enabling superior alignment and change-classification accuracy,
    coupled with deep integrations that transform raw compares into routed,
    acknowledged, and auditable change management—something basic compare tools
    and generic document platforms do not deliver.
