  problem:
    - >-
      Wholesalers receive inconsistent product data from hundreds of vendors
      (CSV, EDI, XLSX, PDFs, images); manual normalization and enrichment is
      slow (minutes per SKU) and error-prone, delaying e-commerce and catalog
      launches.
    - >-
      Spec sheets and sell-sheets must be rebuilt for every brand/channel with
      different attribute requirements; current workflows rely on designers and
      copywriters, driving high per-page costs and long lead times.
    - >-
      Multilingual content (e.g., English, Spanish, French) and brand tone
      consistency are difficult to scale without dedicated teams; translation
      quality and tone drift increase return rates and support tickets.
    - >-
      Compliance and channel requirements (UNSPSC mapping, GTIN/UPC validation,
      units/packaging levels, hazard flags, Proposition 65, eco labels) are
      inconsistently captured, causing listing rejections and operational
      rework.
    - >-
      Existing PIM/DAM systems store data but do not automate extraction from
      PDFs nor generate channel-ready copy/spec sheets; teams still perform
      significant manual work inside these tools.
    - >-
      High SKU turnover and frequent vendor updates create stale content;
      keeping web-ready assets and spec sheets synchronized across
      PIM/ERP/e-commerce is burdensome.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion: Connect to vendor feeds (CSV/XLSX/XML/EDI), email
      drops, SFTP and scrape/parse vendor PDFs using OCR/document AI;
      auto-detect packaging levels (each/inner/case) and normalize units.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned AI enrichment: Generate titles, bullets, long descriptions,
      attributes and compliance flags aligned to UNSPSC/GS1; deduplicate and
      merge variants; create SEO-friendly copy in brand tone.
    - >-
      Spec sheet generator: Output branded spec sheets/sell-sheets in
      configurable templates (PDF/PNG) with QR codes and dynamic data binding;
      regenerate on data updates.
    - >-
      Translations at scale: Human-in-the-loop machine translation (EN/ES/FR/PT)
      with glossary and tone control; approval workflows and versioning.
    - >-
      Image/DAM pipeline: Background removal, auto-cropping, web-ready sizes,
      alt text; associate vendor images and create missing basic visuals when
      allowed; CDN links for sites/marketplaces.
    - >-
      QA and compliance: Field-level confidence scores, validation rules,
      exception queues, GTIN/UPC checks, unit conversions, hazard/eco-label
      flags; first-pass-yield tracking.
    - >-
      Publishing/connectors: APIs and out-of-the-box connectors to common
      PIM/ERP/e-commerce (e.g., Akeneo, Plytix, NetSuite, Acumatica, Microsoft
      Dynamics, Adobe Commerce, BigCommerce, Shopify B2B); marketplace/channel
      templates.
    - >-
      Operations console: Mapping library for popular vendor formats, change
      tracking, audit trails, and SLA monitoring; ROI dashboard (time saved,
      error reductions, channel acceptance).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy vendor feeds and PDFs into enriched, brand-consistent,
    multilingual product content, spec sheets, and web-ready assets—10x faster,
    60–80% lower cost per SKU, with measurable accuracy and channel compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical focus with a growing corpus of labeled office-supply vendor PDFs
    and mapping templates, enabling higher first-pass yield than generalist
    tools; closed-loop learning across customers for recurring SKUs, plus
    spec-sheet templates and tone/translation glossaries tailored to this
    industry.
