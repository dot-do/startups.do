  problem:
    - >-
      Founders and sales teams spend 8–20 hours turning an outline into a
      polished, on‑brand deck.
    - >-
      Non-designers struggle to apply brand guidelines consistently across
      slides, charts, and icons.
    - >-
      Agencies/freelancers are slow (3–10 days) and expensive ($500–$5,000 per
      deck) with long iteration cycles.
    - >-
      Existing AI presentation tools create generic, off-brand slides that still
      require heavy manual editing.
    - >-
      Last‑minute investor/sales deadlines require fast, reliable turnaround
      with minimal back‑and‑forth.
    - >-
      Creating accurate charts from raw data and aligning them with brand styles
      is time‑consuming and error‑prone.
    - >-
      Version control and collaboration across founders/AE/marketing often
      breaks deck consistency.
    - >-
      Teams need export-ready .pptx/.key/.gslides and editable masters, not just
      web viewers.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click deck generation from an outline, doc, or Notion page; automatic
      slide structure mapping to investor/sales narrative frameworks.
    - >-
      Brand Kit ingestion (logos, fonts, color palette, tone) to auto-apply
      consistent visual identity and slide masters.
    - >-
      Chart builder: parse pasted tables/CSV, pick correct chart type, apply
      brand styles, and output editable charts.
    - >-
      Iconography and visuals: semantic icon selection from licensed libraries;
      consistent style across deck.
    - >-
      Revision via natural language prompts: “make slide 5 metric-first,”
      “reduce text by 30%,” “add case study slide.”
    - >-
      Export to .pptx, Google Slides, and .key with editable shapes, fonts, and
      masters; PDF for sharing.
    - 'Collaboration: comments, version history, and brand guardrails for teams.'
    - >-
      Template library for common use-cases (Seed, Series A, Enterprise sales,
      Product demo, ROI case study).
    - >-
      Quality scoring: readability, narrative completeness, and consistency
      checks; suggestions to strengthen story.
    - >-
      Optional human-in-the-loop polish (24-hour turnaround) and review by
      certified designers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any outline or doc into an investor- or sales‑ready, fully on‑brand
    deck (with accurate charts and iconography) in minutes—exportable to
    PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote, with optional same‑day human polish.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A brand-aware narrative engine trained on thousands of high-performing
    investor/sales decks plus a proprietary brand kit and charting pipeline that
    outputs fully editable .pptx/.key/.gslides with high fidelity. Distribution
    moat via accelerator/coaching and freelancer white‑label partnerships, and
    quality moat via optional same‑day human polish tightly integrated into the
    AI workflow.
