leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High and volatile energy costs (electricity demand charges of $60–$150/kW
      and TOU spreads of 2–6¢/kWh; natural gas 6–12 $/MMBtu) erode margin in
      secondary smelting and alloying of aluminum.
    - >-
      Uncoordinated melt/hold schedules create coincident peaks (melt starts,
      charger pumps, holders, compressors) driving avoidable demand charges of
      10–30% of monthly electricity bills.
    - >-
      Manual scheduling struggles to meet order due dates under real constraints
      (alloy recipes, furnace capacities, charge make-up, tap-to-tap times,
      dross management), leading to late orders or excess WIP/finished goods.
    - >-
      Excess door-open and idle-hold time increase fuel/electricity use (3–10%),
      metal oxidation and dross (0.3–1.0% of charge), and operator fatigue.
    - >-
      Limited visibility of tariffs, DR events, and real-time loads prevents
      plants from monetizing demand response and off-peak opportunities.
    - >-
      Generic APS/EMS tools lack aluminum-specific physics (melt curves by
      charge composition, heat balance, skimming cycles), causing adoption
      failures or poor ROI.
  solution:
    - >-
      Digital twin of melt shop: models each furnace’s melt rate vs charge mix,
      hold losses, door-open effects, skimming cycles, and alloy changeover
      times.
    - >-
      AI-driven scheduler (MILP + heuristic search) that sequences melts, taps,
      and holds to cap site kW, shift load off-peak, and ensure OTIF delivery.
    - >-
      Real-time re-optimization when orders, equipment status, or market prices
      change; keeps demand below a configurable cap while protecting due dates.
    - >-
      Tariff engine: ingests TOU tariffs, ratchets, demand charges, and DR event
      signals; simulates bill impact before schedule release.
    - >-
      Operator-first HMI: clear 8–24h schedule, start/stop prompts, door-open
      timers, and alerts for predicted cap violations or late orders.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test “cap at 1.2 MW,” “add weekend shift,” “change
      charge mix,” or “move alloys” and compare cost/throughput/dross.
    - >-
      Integrations: MES/ERP (orders, BOM/recipes), SCADA/PLC (tags for
      temperatures, burners, pumps, power), energy meters, historian, and LIMS.
    - >-
      Analytics: kWh/ton, $/ton energy, peak kW, door-open minutes/heat,
      hold-over time, dross %, schedule adherence, and CO2e/ton.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    deadlines and lowering dross/idle time—via an aluminum-specific AI scheduler
    that co-optimizes melt/hold sequences, energy tariffs, and shop-floor
    constraints with measurable, guaranteed savings.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Melt-shop supervisors and production schedulers at secondary aluminum
    smelters who must hit ship dates while controlling energy spend.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned melt/hold overlaps spike peak kW, waste energy during
    idle/door-open time, and jam furnace capacity. Internal: Constant
    firefighting and guesswork create stress and late nights. Philosophical:
    Energy should serve production—not punish it—for meeting customer
    commitments.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve run furnaces under TOU tariffs and demand ratchets; we know
    the pressure of juggling alloys, holds, and due dates. Authority: Built with
    metallurgical, scheduling, and energy-pricing expertise; proven in pilots to
    reduce peaks and door-open losses while maintaining throughput.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect furnace telemetry, order book, tariffs, and
    constraints. 2) Configure melt rates, batch sizes, alloys, maintenance, and
    hold limits. 3) AI optimizes melt/hold sequence to minimize peaks, idle, and
    door-open time while meeting deadlines. 4) Operators receive heat-by-heat
    schedules, alerts, and adherence tracking; model learns continuously.
    Agreement plan: Start a 4-week pilot, keep current workflows, define clear
    ROI targets, cancel anytime; your data stays yours (SOC 2 / on-prem
    options).
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download the ROI
    calculator and sample optimized schedules.
  success: >-
    Lower peak demand charges and kWh cost; fewer idles and door-open losses;
    reduced dross/oxidation; on-time delivery with higher throughput; less
    operator stress and rework; auditable energy and production KPIs.
  failure: >-
    Without this: Peak penalties persist, idle and door-open losses grow, more
    dross/scrap, late orders and overtime, higher CO2 per ton, and margins
    erode.

  problem:
    - Demand charges spike when multiple furnaces ramp at once.
    - Manual schedules can’t keep up with rush orders and scrap variability.
    - Idle/hold and door-open time waste energy and increase melt loss.
    - Operators lack visibility into the true cost of each scheduling decision.
    - >-
      Casting windows and furnace availability aren’t coordinated, causing
      reheat and delays.
    - 'Complex tariffs (TOU, real-time pricing) make cost planning guesswork.'
