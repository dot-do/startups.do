  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent/low-volume demand for 60–300k SKUs per OEM yields 30–50% MAPE
      with traditional methods, driving excess safety stock and stockouts.
    - >-
      Multi‑echelon networks (central DC, regional DCs, forward stocking
      locations at customer sites) are not optimized jointly; local planners
      over-buffer by 20–40%.
    - >-
      Lead times are volatile (supplier, customs, refurbishment); planners use
      static lead times, causing misaligned reorder points and frequent
      expedites (5–10% of lines).
    - >-
      Obsolescence risk is high for parts tied to tool generations; 5–12% of
      inventory value is written off annually.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (ERP, service tickets, installed-base registry, BOMs); lack
      of telemetry/usage linkage to failure rates results in reactive planning,
      backorders, and SLA penalties.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data model that links installed base (by tool family/serial),
      BOMs, criticality, service tickets, and supplier lead times to SKU demand.
    - >-
      Intermittent-demand forecasting (Croston/TSB + gradient boosting/deep
      learning) tuned to failure modes, usage, and environment per region/site.
    - >-
      Prescriptive multi‑echelon optimization that sets service-level targets,
      safety stock, reorder points, and lateral transship policies across DC →
      RDC → FSL.
    - >-
      Lead-time intelligence using supplier performance distributions and
      in-transit variability to dynamically adjust buffer positions.
    - >-
      Scenario planning (new product introductions, EOL, supplier disruption)
      with projected KPIs: fill rate, working capital, expedites, obsolescence.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration to ERP/APS (SAP, Oracle, Kinaxis, o9) for
      automated order proposals and planner-in-the-loop approvals.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-native, semiconductor-specific spare parts optimizer that forecasts
    intermittent demand from installed-base and service signals and prescribes
    multi‑echelon stocking and safety stock by site to hit 98–99% fill rates
    while reducing inventory 15–25% and expedites 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Semiconductor-specific intermittent-demand models and a curated
    failure-rate/compatibility library tied to installed-base digital twins,
    plus prebuilt ERP/APS connectors that enable faster time-to-value (pilot in
    12–16 weeks) than generic planning suites.

  character: >-
    Service, supply chain, and spare‑parts leaders at semiconductor equipment
    manufacturers who must keep fabs running while minimizing inventory and
    cost.
  problem: >-
    Volatile, long‑lead‑time demand across a global installed base makes parts
    planning guesswork—causing stockouts, excess, expedites, and missed SLAs.
    You shouldn’t have to choose between uptime and working capital.
  guide: >-
    We understand NAICS 333242 service complexity. Our AI fuses install‑base,
    usage, BOM, lead‑time, and failure signals to forecast demand and set
    multi‑echelon stocking and safety stock by region/warehouse—proven with
    capital equipment OEMs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/CMMS/field data securely. 2) Run a 6‑week pilot to calibrate
    forecasts and policies. 3) Roll out multi‑echelon stocking with automated
    replenishment and continuous monitoring.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot to prove ROI on your top spare‑part
    families.
  success: >-
    Achieve 95%+ fill rates with 15–30% lower working capital, 30–50% fewer
    expedites, higher equipment uptime, and clear regional/warehouse visibility
    and control.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you keep firefighting demand, overbuying slow‑movers, stocking
    out on critical parts, missing SLAs, and risking costly fab downtime and
    customer churn.
