  problem:
    - >-
      Unpredictable turn delays from late inbound, gate conflicts, crew
      constraints, fueling, catering, baggage, and minor maintenance lead to
      missed D0/T-15 targets and reactionary delays across the network.
    - >-
      Siloed systems (AODB, DCS, ACARS, ADS-B, workforce management, ground
      handler tools) and manual comms (radio/WhatsApp) make it hard to see risk
      early and coordinate multi-party mitigations.
    - >-
      No standard, explainable, station-level risk scoring that predicts delay
      15–90 minutes ahead and drives specific actions; current tools are
      descriptive, not prescriptive.
    - >-
      Delay costs are high and compounding: FAA/industry estimates often range
      $74–$150 per delay minute depending on carrier and region; even 0.5–1.0
      min saved per departure materially improves profitability.
    - >-
      Airlines face OTP penalties, slot risks (A-CDM airports), customer
      satisfaction impact, and increased crew/aircraft utilization costs.
    - >-
      Ground handlers lack shared SLAs, timers, and cross-organization
      playbooks; accountability and root-cause attribution are weak.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time turn risk scoring: Predict off-block and D0/T-15 risk
      continuously using schedule, inbound status, ACARS/ADS-B, resource
      rosters, weather, stand availability, and historical patterns.
    - >-
      Explainable AI: Feature-level drivers show why a turn is at risk (e.g.,
      late inbound EIBT, gate swap likelihood, fueling queue, crew connection
      risk).
    - >-
      Dynamic playbooks: Airline- and station-specific mitigations
      auto-triggered by risk thresholds (e.g., pre-stage belt loaders,
      prioritize fueling, call extra cleaners, gate swap now vs wait, board by
      rows).
    - >-
      Task orchestration: Create, assign, and track tasks with SLA timers across
      handlers; escalate automatically if SLA at risk; mobile-first UX for
      ramp/gate teams.
    - >-
      A-CDM alignment: Improve TOBT accuracy, surface TSAT risk, and nudge early
      TOBT updates to protect slots at CDM airports.
    - >-
      Comms hub: Role-based notifications via mobile, web, SITA Type B/email, MS
      Teams/Slack, with audit trails.
    - >-
      What-if and simulation: Test mitigations (add 1 extra ramp crew vs gate
      swap), see predicted delay impact and cost before committing.
    - >-
      Outcome analytics: Delay minutes avoided, D0 lift, root-cause attribution
      by IATA delay codes, station benchmarking, and handler SLA reporting.
    - >-
      Secure integration kit: Connectors for AODB, DCS, ACARS/EDIFACT, ADS-B
      providers, workforce scheduling, maintenance, and weather APIs.
    - >-
      Offline-tolerant ops: Local caching on devices; graceful degradation to
      ensure critical tasks and timers continue during network blips.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predictive turn risk scoring plus automated, multi-party task orchestration
    that protects D0/T-15 OTP. TurnGuard AI forecasts delay 15–90 minutes ahead,
    triggers airline-specific playbooks, assigns tasks to handlers, and proves
    ROI in weeks with measurable delay minutes avoided.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, cross-airline turn graph and playbook engine that
    encodes station-specific realities, coupled with a deep integration library
    that shortens time-to-value; early reference wins creating proprietary
    labeled datasets and change-management know-how competitors struggle to
    replicate.

    Airline ops leaders (OCC, station, and ground handling) who must protect OTP
    on tight turn schedules.
  problem: >-
    Turn delays from fragmented ground workflows, late visibility, and slow
    comms cause OTP misses, misconnects, curfews, and rising costs.
  guide: >-
    We’re airline ops veterans with an AI engine proven to predict turn risk
    minutes ahead and coordinate the right team at the right time.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect AODB/MVT/ACARS and ramp apps; 2) Start predictive turn monitoring
    at target stations; 3) Auto-orchestrate tasks, SLAs, and notifications
    across ramp/cabin/catering/fuel/gate; 4) Review impact and scale fleetwide.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 4-week station pilot.
  success: >-
    Higher OTP, fewer delay minutes and misconnects, smoother turns, happier
    crews and passengers, and measurable cost savings.
  failure: >-
    Another season of preventable delays, missed slots and curfews, escalations,
    compensation payouts, and excess fuel burn.
