  problem:
    - >-
      Growers lose ROI by applying uniform seeding rates across highly variable
      fields, causing over-seeding in low-productivity zones and under-seeding
      in high-potential zones.
    - >-
      Existing tools often use single-year data or generic soil layers, leading
      to unstable prescriptions that don’t generalize across seasons.
    - >-
      Creating accurate prescriptions is time-consuming (2–6 hours/field) and
      requires juggling multiple software tools; many growers and advisors lack
      bandwidth.
    - >-
      Machine compatibility and file formats (ISOXML, shapefile, Deere, CNH,
      AgLeader) create friction, failed uploads, and lost planting windows.
    - >-
      Trust is low without field-verified ROI; many solutions lack built-in
      check strips and post-harvest analytics to quantify impact.
    - >-
      Consultants need scalable workflows and version control to manage hundreds
      of fields, multiple hybrids, and late-season changes.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across monitors, clouds, and thumb drives; pulling
      multi-year yield, EC, and elevation into one workflow is painful.
    - >-
      Seed dealers and retailers want neutral, hybrid-aware scripts but are seen
      as biased; growers want brand-agnostic recommendations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion: pull multi-year yield maps (3–7 years), EC layers,
      LiDAR/RTK elevation, slope/curvature, SSURGO/SoilLandscapes, and optional
      imagery via APIs (e.g., Ops Center, FieldView, AFS).
    - >-
      Stability-first zoning: ML clusters management zones using yield
      variance/stability, EC, topography, and soil; flags non-stable data and
      edge effects.
    - >-
      Hybrid-specific response: libraries of hybrid/variety response curves to
      population and environment; accommodates user-supplied or seed-company
      curves.
    - >-
      Prescription engine: sets min/max/step rates and equipment constraints;
      generates multi-hybrid and multi-crop scripts with headland and waterways
      handling.
    - >-
      Machine-ready exports: push/pull with Deere Ops Center, CNH AFS Connect,
      AgLeader SMS/AgFiniti; export ISOXML, shapefile, CN1, AgLeader .irx;
      monitor-specific QA to prevent errors.
    - >-
      Rapid iteration and overrides: simulate scenarios (seed price, expected
      commodity price, planting date); one-click re-run with constraints;
      offline-capable field app.
    - >-
      In-field validation: auto-insert randomized check strips and VR blocks;
      after harvest, compute zone-by-zone ROI and prescription accuracy.
    - >-
      Ops dashboard: track acres scripted, monitor sync status, last edit,
      planter assignments; prescription versioning and audit trail.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven variable-rate seeding prescriptions that combine multi-year yield
    stability, on-the-go EC, and elevation/topography to optimize population by
    management zone, delivered as machine-ready files for all major
    monitors—backed by in-field check strips and a post-harvest ROI report.
    Typical outcomes: 2–6% yield lift in responsive zones and 4–10% seed savings
    in constrained zones, targeting $10–$25/acre net gain after fees.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning system: every prescription ships with built-in check
    strips and harvest-time analytics, continuously improving
    hybrid-by-environment response models and zone stability. Combined with
    broad, battle-tested monitor compatibility and neutral positioning across
    seed brands, this shortens time-to-value and builds unique, defensible
    agronomic IP.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Row-crop growers, farm managers, and ag retailers who want every seed to
    earn its keep across variable soils and terrain.
  problem: >-
    Uniform seeding ignores multi-year yield stability, soil, EC, and
    elevation—causing over/under-planting, wasted seed, uneven stands, and
    file-format headaches that slow soil prep, planting, and cultivating.
  guide: >-
    An agronomy-first AI partner that blends multi-year yield, soil/EC, and
    elevation to create management zones and right-sized populations—simple,
    trusted, and machine-ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect fields and data (boundaries, yield, soil/EC/elevation). 2) Review
    AI zones and population recs; tweak with your agronomist. 3) Export
    machine-ready prescriptions and implement across soil prep, planting, and
    cultivating.
  callToAction: >-
    Start with one field—upload your data or book a 15-minute demo to generate a
    pilot prescription.
  success: >-
    Uniform emergence, higher yield-per-seed, fewer replants, lower seed waste,
    smoother operations, and confidence that every zone is planted right.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing rates, wasting seed, fighting incompatible files, and living
    with uneven stands and missed yield potential.
