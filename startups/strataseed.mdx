  problem:
    - >-
      Minor-grain producers (barley, oats, rye, triticale, millet, buckwheat,
      sorghum, wild rice) face high within-field variability leading to 5–20%
      seed waste and suboptimal fertilizer allocation.
    - >-
      Most VRA tools and agronomic models are tuned for corn/soy/wheat; minor
      grains have different response curves and quality targets (e.g., protein
      for barley/rye), resulting in poor fit and low ROI.
    - >-
      Growers struggle to combine multi-year yield maps, soil tests,
      elevation/terrain, and remote sensing into simple, equipment-ready
      prescriptions that work across mixed fleets.
    - >-
      ROI uncertainty: growers lack fast proof that prescriptions beat
      flat-rate. Few tools create on-field check strips and measurable
      comparisons.
    - >-
      Data friction: format incompatibilities (ISOXML, shapefile, proprietary),
      messy yield data cleaning, and disconnected soil lab results slow
      adoption.
    - >-
      Limited access to minor-grain agronomy expertise; retailers focus
      resources on large-acre crops, leaving small grains under-served.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion and cleaning pipeline: multi-year yield maps,
      soil test CSV/PDF parsing, elevation/terrain derivatives, remote sensing
      indices.
    - >-
      Zone creation optimized for minor grains: stability-weighted clustering
      across years, topographic wetness and slope breaks, and operational
      constraints (minimum pass width, headlands).
    - >-
      Rate optimization using crop- and region-specific response models (seed
      rate, N-P-K-S), with optional economic optimization (prices, costs,
      protein premiums/discounts).
    - >-
      Equipment-ready exports: ISOXML and shapefiles supporting John Deere, CNH,
      AGCO, Trimble, Ag Leader; as-applied reconciliation after fieldwork.
    - >-
      Embedded A/B and check-strip design per field for measurable yield,
      protein, and margin deltas vs flat-rate.
    - >-
      Web dashboard to simulate scenarios (prices, weather risk, fertility
      caps), audit decisions, and track season outcomes.
    - >-
      White-label portal for retailers/applicators with per-grower permissions
      and bulk job management.
    - >-
      Support playbooks: field-level QC, pre-season onboarding in <7 days,
      in-season hotline, post-harvest ROI reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, minor-grain–specific VRA seeding and fertilizer prescriptions
    that raise profit per acre by $15–$40 through data fusion of yield maps,
    soil tests, and terrain—exported as ISOXML/shapefiles that run on most
    equipment, with embedded check strips to prove ROI in the first season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, regionally calibrated response curve library for minor grains
    plus an equipment-compatibility validation suite that achieves ≥99% load
    success across mixed fleets, combined with embedded check-strip workflows
    that verify ROI in-season—creating a data moat and proof engine competitors
    lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Minor-grain growers (oats, barley, rye, sorghum, millet, canola, etc.) who
    want higher ROI from seed and fertilizer without wrestling with GIS files or
    vendor lock-in.
  problem: >-
    External: Highly variable fields, messy data, and equipment compatibility
    headaches make VRA hard. Internal: Unsure where to change rates and short on
    time. Philosophical: Farmers shouldn’t waste inputs because tools ignore
    their crop and terrain nuances.
  guide: >-
    We understand minor-grain agronomy and tight field windows. Our AI builds
    zones from yield maps, soil tests, and terrain; rates are reviewed by
    agronomists and exported as ISOXML/shapefiles that work with most
    Deere/CNH/AGCO monitors. Proven workflows, clear support, no black-box
    surprises.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload or connect yield maps, soil tests, and boundaries. 2) Review and
    approve zones and rates in the web app. 3) Export ISOXML/shapefiles and load
    to your monitor. Promise: transparent per-acre pricing, you own your data,
    unlimited tweaks before go-time.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free 1-field trial or book a 15-minute setup call.
    Transitional: Download a sample prescription and ROI calculator, plus an
    equipment compatibility checklist.
  success: >-
    Right-rate seed and nutrients by zone; often 5–15% input savings where
    variability exists; more uniform stands; steadier yields on marginal acres;
    files that just work; audit-ready documentation and better environmental
    stewardship.
  failure: >-
    Stick with flat rates and keep over/under-applying, wasting inputs, fighting
    bad file formats, reworking in-season, and missing yield on variable ground.
