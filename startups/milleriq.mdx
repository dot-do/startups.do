leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile wheat prices and basis differentials by protein/grade expose
      mills to margin swings of 8–20% YoY without a systematic hedging policy.
    - >-
      Demand by grade/protein is hard to predict; many mills run >20% MAPE on
      grade-level forecasts, leading to overbuying of the wrong specs and costly
      blending workarounds.
    - >-
      Inventory visibility is fragmented across silos, elevators, and in-transit
      railcars; planners lack a forward coverage view (days-of-cover by grade)
      tied to actual sales and production plans.
    - >-
      Procurement timing is ad hoc; buyers chase spot deals and miss seasonal
      carry/backwardation opportunities worth 3–12 cents/bu.
    - >-
      Hedging is inconsistent; hedge ratios are either too low (under-hedged) or
      too high (over-hedged), creating cash flow and margin risk.
    - >-
      No integrated view of physical vs. financial positions; futures/options,
      basis, and physical POs live in different systems, hindering true exposure
      measurement.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trails for hedge recommendations are manual;
      difficult to prove policy adherence or backtest decisions.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MRP tools aren’t grade-specific and don’t model protein
      specs, blend constraints, basis risk, or freight spreads at actionable
      granularity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: Connect ERP/MES (orders, production plan), QA lab
      (protein/fall number), inventory (silos/elevators), logistics
      (railcar/barge), and market data (futures, basis, freight, weather).
    - >-
      Grade-level demand forecasting: ML models predict weekly demand by
      grade/protein and customer segment; configurable service-level targets per
      SKU/grade.
    - >-
      Inventory and coverage projection: Forward days-of-cover by grade/site;
      alerts for under/over-coverage vs policy bands (e.g., 45–60 days).
    - >-
      Procurement optimizer: Recommends PO timing, volumes, and grade/protein
      mix; quantifies cost-of-carry vs. expected basis/futures moves and freight
      spreads.
    - >-
      Hedging advisor: Suggests hedge ratios by tenor/contract (e.g., KC/Chicago
      spreads), basis locks, and options structures (e.g., collars) with P&L and
      VaR impact; includes policy guardrails.
    - >-
      Scenario and stress testing: Simulate weather/yield shocks, export
      changes, and freight disruptions; show impact on costs, coverage, and
      margin-at-risk.
    - >-
      Execution workflow and audit: One-click recommendations-to-orders
      workflow, approvals, and immutable audit trail; export to ERP and FCM
      ticketing.
    - >-
      Performance analytics: Track realized savings vs benchmark, hedge
      effectiveness, forecast MAPE, basis capture, and policy adherence.
    - >-
      Pilot program: 8–12 week deployment at 1–2 plants with success criteria
      (e.g., <12% grade MAPE, 30% fewer coverage exceptions, ≥$0.05/bu savings).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Grade-specific demand forecasting and exposure-aware hedging in one system.
    MillerIQ connects your ERP, QA lab protein data, logistics, and market data
    to project inventory and coverage by grade/protein, then recommends
    time-phased purchases and futures/options/basis hedges that reduce cost and
    volatility. Typical outcomes: 30–50% reduction in grade-level forecast
    error, 15–25% lower COGS volatility, 3–8 cents/bu better basis capture, and
    10–20 days working-capital reduction within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Tightly coupled grade/protein forecasting, blend optimization, and hedge
    recommendation engine with policy guardrails and audit trail—built
    specifically for flour milling. Cross-client anonymized benchmarks and
    prebuilt ERP/FCM connectors accelerate time-to-value. Compliance-ready
    workflows reduce organizational risk versus generic planning tools or
    broker-only advice.
