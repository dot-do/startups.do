leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or rule-based wave planning results in suboptimal batching, excess
      travel, and congestion—travel often represents 50–60% of picker time.
    - >-
      Most WMS native wave/pick-path modules are coarse-grained (simple zone or
      aisle sorting) and don’t model real constraints (equipment types, one-way
      aisles, replenishment locks, freezer rules, replen/put-away conflicts).
    - >-
      Operations need to react to late orders, carrier cutoffs, and labor
      fluctuations by re-waving mid-shift—manual re-planning takes 30–90 minutes
      and creates SLA risk.
    - >-
      Peak season volatility causes 20–40% swings in demand; static rules
      degrade quickly and require constant IE/WMS admin attention.
    - >-
      Mixed-mode environments (case, each, pallet; RF vs. voice; AMR vs. manual)
      require multi-objective optimization across conflicting goals (throughput,
      congestion, travel distance, due-time adherence).
    - >-
      Facilities lack actionable visibility into path efficiency: no heatmaps of
      congestion, no what-if simulation, no closed-loop learning from historical
      pick telemetry.
    - >-
      High turnover and training burden—inefficient paths amplify training time
      and error rates, hurting OTIF and chargebacks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Integrate with WMS to ingest orders, inventory, locations, labor/equipment
      availability, carrier cutoffs (via APIs/flat files).
    - >-
      AI clustering: batch/cluster orders into waves by due-times, zones, SKU
      affinity, load type, temperature, equipment constraints, and historical
      congestion patterns.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware routing: generate optimal pick paths per zone and
      picker/equipment type (walkers, pallet jacks, forklifts, AMRs), honoring
      one-way aisles, no-go times, replenishment locks, and safety buffers.
    - >-
      Dynamic rebalancing: re-optimize waves and paths mid-shift when late
      orders arrive or labor changes; micro-waves to fill idle capacity without
      spiking congestion.
    - >-
      Heatmap and simulation: digital twin to simulate what-if scenarios (e.g.,
      change cutoffs, shift labor, resequence aisles) with projected KPIs before
      release.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: continuously learns from pick telemetry
      (RF/voice/AMR) to refine travel-time estimates, congestion penalties, and
      zone speeds.
    - >-
      KPI cockpit: real-time visibility into picks/hour, path efficiency, order
      cycle time, on-time ship %, congestion index, and SLA risk with actionable
      alerts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut picker travel 20–35% and increase picks per labor hour 15–30% within 6–8
    weeks, with constraint-aware waves and optimal paths that plug into your
    existing WMS/RF/voice stack. 3–5x ROI in ≤6 months; zero-rip-and-replace.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Constraint-complete optimizer with prebuilt connectors and a warehouse
    digital twin that learns from cross-site telemetry—enabling faster
    time-to-value (≤6 weeks), explainable decisions, and continuous improvement
    unmatched by rule-based WMS modules. Early partner ecosystem and SOC 2
    readiness reduce enterprise friction.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      3PLs and contract logistics providers operating 50k–1M+ sq ft DCs, 5k–60k
      order lines/day, manual/semi-automated picking.

    Warehouse operations manager or 3PL supervisor in Other Warehousing &
    Storage (NAICS 493190) who must hit ship cutoffs with limited labor and
    mixed equipment.
  problem: >-
    Manual wave building and static pick paths waste travel, cause aisle
    congestion, and break SLAs when order mix, zones, and equipment constraints
    shift; it shouldn’t be this hard to ship on time.
  guide: >-
    Pick Path & Wave Planning Optimizer is an AI co-planner built by warehouse
    engineers. We understand cutoffs and labor limits, and we’ve helped 493190
    sites boost throughput with constraint-aware batching and routing.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect a read-only feed from your WMS; 2) Set rules: zones, equipment,
    cart/tote limits, SLAs; 3) Auto-generate waves and optimal pick paths,
    simulate before release, then monitor KPIs and refine.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and start a 2-week pilot; get a free pick-travel and
    wave-efficiency report.
  success: >-
    30–50% less travel per pick, 10–25% higher lines/hour, fewer touches and
    mispicks, higher on-time ship rate, lower overtime and cost-per-order,
    smoother docks and aisles.
  failure: >-
    Without it: continued manual planning, jammed aisles, missed cutoffs, wasted
    travel, mispicks, overtime, and eroding margins.
