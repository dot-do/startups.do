  problem:
    - >-
      Forestry support crews (logging, road building, tree planting, thinning,
      prescribed burn prep) operate in remote, fire-prone areas with rapidly
      changing weather; manual monitoring of disparate weather/fire sources
      leaves gaps during critical windows.
    - >-
      Superintendents lack operations-aware alerts tied to crew schedules and
      locations, resulting in avoidable shutdowns, near-misses, and
      non-compliance with wind/gust and smoke exposure policies.
    - >-
      Regulators and prime contractors increasingly require documented risk
      assessments and alert/audit trails, but crews lack simple,
      low-connectivity tools to capture evidence of due diligence.
    - >-
      Existing weather apps are not tuned to fire weather indices (e.g., FWI,
      ERC, Haines), proximity-to-active-fire, or smoke PM2.5 thresholds at the
      sub-5 km scale relevant to forestry operations.
    - >-
      False alarms and generic regional alerts erode trust; teams need
      calibrated, threshold-based alerts with two-way acknowledgment and concise
      daily briefings, not generic forecasts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and fuse authoritative data: NWS/NOAA HRRR & HREF wind/gusts, Red
      Flag warnings, GFS/ICON, RAWS stations; satellite fire detections
      (VIIRS/MODIS/GOES); perimeters (IRWIN/NIFC); smoke/PM2.5 forecasts
      (HRRR-Smoke/CAMS/BlueSky).
    - >-
      Compute and update fire weather indices and triggers: FWI components
      (FFMC, ISI, DMC, DC), ERC percentiles (where available), Haines Index,
      wind/gust exceedance, RH/temperature/lighting; update at least hourly with
      1–3 km spatial resolution where available.
    - >-
      Crew geofencing and schedule integration: define crew
      polygons/lines/buffers (e.g., cut blocks, haul routes) and shift times to
      only alert when and where crews are active.
    - >-
      Proximity and trajectory analytics: alert when active fire starts within
      configurable radii (e.g., 10/25/50 km) and when modeled growth vectors or
      wind could impact operations within N hours.
    - >-
      Smoke exposure alerts using PM2.5 thresholds (e.g., 35/55/150 µg/m³) and
      AQI bands; provide recommended PPE/operational guidance by threshold.
    - >-
      Multi-channel, low-connectivity delivery: SMS, radio-ready short codes,
      inReach/Zoleo/Iridium messaging, mobile app with offline caching, email,
      and web dashboard; two-way acknowledgment and escalation.
    - >-
      Daily Ops Brief: auto-generated 06:00 local PDF/Email with site-specific
      indices, thresholds, risk color-coding, and recommended actions; archived
      for audits.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations: Esri/ArcGIS layers, Trimble Forestry, fleet
      telematics, and safety platforms; export ICS-style reports (e.g., ICS-215A
      risk summary).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Operations-aware wildfire and weather risk intelligence that aligns to each
    crew’s schedule and location, delivering sub-hourly, hyperlocal alerts
    (wind/gust, fire weather indices, smoke, active fire proximity) with
    offline-capable, two-way acknowledgment and automatic compliance
    reporting—reducing shutdowns, exposures, and paperwork.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Operations-aware design: we bind risk intelligence to actual crew geofences,
    shifts, and policies with two-way, offline-capable acknowledgments and
    immutable audit trails—creating a proprietary dataset of “alert -> action ->
    outcome” signals that improves calibration and trust over time. Competitors
    provide generic forecasts; we close the loop at the crew level in the woods.
