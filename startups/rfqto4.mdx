leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ-to-quote cycle times are 3–15 business days for engineered-to-order
      conveyors; buyers now expect 24–72 hours, causing lost deals.
    - >-
      Application engineering is a bottleneck; tribal knowledge is locked in
      senior engineers, leading to inconsistent scoping, margins, and errors.
    - >-
      BOM creation from multi-document RFQ packs (PDFs, drawings, spreadsheets)
      is manual, error-prone, and poorly traceable.
    - >-
      Pricing and margin control lacks guardrails; discounting and cost rollups
      are inconsistent across reps and regions.
    - >-
      Sales teams spend 30–60% of time on admin (extracting specs, redlining
      terms, formatting proposals) instead of selling.
    - >-
      High RFQ volume with low hit rates (10–30%) wastes engineering hours that
      could be better qualified and prioritized.
    - >-
      Revisions management is messy; version confusion leads to misquotes, late
      proposals, and re-work.
    - >-
      Integrations between CAD/PLM/ERP/CRM are fragile; duplicated data entry
      causes delays and mistakes.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ ingestion pipeline that reads PDFs, drawings (DWG, DXF), 3D (STEP),
      spreadsheets, and emails to extract specs, constraints, and quantities.
    - >-
      Domain-trained concept generator that maps requirements to standard
      modules (belt/roller/chain/screw, drives, frames, supports, guards) and
      suggests a preliminary layout consistent with CEMA and customer standards.
    - >-
      BOM and cost builder with vendor catalogs (motors/gearboxes/rollers/belts)
      and cost-rollups, including labor, overhead, and freight; configurable
      pricing rules and margin guardrails.
    - >-
      Proposal composer that outputs branded proposals (Word/PDF) with
      configurable options, drawings, lead times, terms, and revision history;
      multi-language/currency support.
    - >-
      Integrations: CAD plugins (SolidWorks/Inventor) for parametric layouts;
      ERP/MRP (Epicor, Infor, SYSPRO, JobBOSS/ECI) for items/costs; CRM
      (Salesforce/HubSpot) for opportunity sync and approvals.
    - >-
      Guided selling and qualification scoring to prioritize winnable RFQs;
      auto-flag risk (tight radii, washdown/IP69K, hazardous areas,
      load/throughput conflicts).
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability: spec-to-requirement links, change logs, and
      audit trails; on-prem/private cloud options for ITAR-sensitive work.
    - >-
      Analytics and coaching: quote cycle time, conversion rates, margin leakage
      analysis, and rep/engineer productivity dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQ packs into a draft concept, BOM, price, and proposal in under 60
    minutes—with domain-trained AI for conveyors, pricing guardrails, CAD-aware
    layouts, and one-click proposal generation. Cut quote time by 70–90%,
    improve win rates by 2–4 points, and protect 2–5 margin points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A conveyor-specific AI stack (CEMA-aligned ontology, parametric design
    templates, and curated component catalogs) trained on hundreds of thousands
    of real RFQ artifacts and outcomes, plus deep integrations with CAD/ERP
    common in the niche—delivering faster time-to-value and higher accuracy than
    horizontal CPQ or generic document AI.

    Conveyor and conveying equipment manufacturers (NAICS 333922) —
    sales/applications engineers and estimators who must turn complex RFQs into
    accurate, on-brand proposals fast.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as messy packs (PDFs, CAD, spreadsheets) with custom
    options and tight deadlines.

    Internal: Teams fear scope gaps, underpricing, and inconsistent proposals
    while tribal knowledge sits in experts’ heads.

    Philosophical: Winning engineered-to-order conveyor work shouldn’t require
    all-nighters to assemble basics.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the ETO quote grind—incomplete RFQs, late revisions, and
    price-pressure.

    topologies and option rules; secure and integrable with CAD/PDM/ERP.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Configure your standards, option catalog, pricing rules, and templates.

    2) Upload RFQ packs (drawings/specs/layouts) or connect your inbox/drive.

    3) Review AI draft (concept, preliminary sizing, BOM with options, price,
    assumptions/exclusions) and publish the proposal.

    Agreement plan: Human-in-the-loop approvals, audit trail, access controls,
    and data isolation aligned to your IT/security requirements.
