  problem:
    - >-
      Designers and estimators at sheet metal shops spend 20–60 minutes per RFQ
      manually checking bend radii, flange lengths, reliefs, and hole/feature
      locations, slowing quotes and clogging throughput.
    - >-
      Up to 1–3% of parts require rework or get scrapped due to bend collisions,
      impossible bend orders, or hole distortion near bends discovered on the
      shop floor.
    - >-
      Rules vary by machine, tooling, material, and thickness; tribal knowledge
      isn’t captured, leading to inconsistent outcomes and training burden for
      new engineers.
    - >-
      Existing CAD/CAM checks are either generic or vendor‑specific, rarely
      producing clear, actionable fix suggestions tied to actual machine/tool
      limits.
    - >-
      Poor DFM leads to missed due dates, margin erosion, and lower win rates in
      fast-turn RFQs where on-time, accurate quotes are decisive.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated rule-based and ML-assisted DFM engine for sheet metal, covering
      bendability, minimum feature sizes, feature-to-bend distances, reliefs,
      grain direction, and tooling constraints.
    - >-
      Machine- and tool-aware checks using libraries for common brakes (Amada,
      Trumpf, Bystronic, Accurpress, etc.), V-dies, hemming tools, and gauge
      availability.
    - >-
      Actionable fix suggestions (e.g., increase inside radius to 1.5T, add
      rectangular relief 1.0T x 3.0T, move hole 2T from bend line) with
      parameterized, one-click updates in CAD or auto-annotated flat patterns.
    - >-
      Bend sequence simulation and collision risk scoring; highlights impossible
      bends or back-gauge reach issues and proposes alternative sequences/tools.
    - >-
      Quoting integration: risk/cost driver summary per part, red/yellow/green
      manufacturability score, and auto-generated notes for customer ECOs.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins for SolidWorks/Inventor/Fusion sheet metal, and neutral
      formats (STEP, DXF, DWG) with secure on-prem/offline options for
      ITAR/CMMC.
    - >-
      Team knowledge capture: define shop-specific rules (minimum flange by die,
      standard radii by material), shareable rule packs per cell/site.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, machine-aware DFM and bendability checks with one-click fixes that
    plug into your CAD/CAM and quoting workflow—cut quoting time by 50%, reduce
    bend-related rework by 25–40%, and standardize best practices across your
    shop.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Machine- and tool-aware rules and bend sequencing calibrated with OEM data
    and real shop outcomes, plus a growing proprietary dataset of parts and
    fixes that continuously improves suggestions; deep integrations across CAD,
    CAM, and quoting create workflow lock-in and switching costs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Sheet‑metal estimators, programmers, and manufacturing engineers who want to
    quote faster and release brake/laser parts that run right the first time.
  problem: >-
    Manual DFM checks miss bendability and tooling limits (min flange, reliefs,
    radii, K‑factor, grain, collisions, tight tolerances), causing rework,
    delays, and margin leaks; quoting uncertain parts feels
    risky—manufacturability shouldn’t be guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Sheet Metal DFM & Bendability Check is an AI service for sheet‑metal work.
    We understand NCRs and late brake setups; our rule‑based engine codifies
    shop standards and OEM tooling libraries to auto‑review parts and propose
    trustworthy fixes.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload DXF/STEP/SolidWorks/PDF. 2) Get an instant DFM report with
    pass/fail rules, bend sequence preview, and one‑click fix suggestions. 3)
    Export corrected geometry and a customer‑ready report or push to
    CAD/CAM/ERP.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a free trial—upload a part now. Or book a 15‑minute demo and download
    a sample report.
  success: >-
    Cut quote time from hours to minutes, prevent re‑spins and scrap, protect
    tooling, standardize DFM across the team, boost first‑pass yield, and ship
    on time with predictable margins.
  failure: >-
    Avoid late jobs, costly rework, damaged tools, scrapped sheets, stalled
    quotes, and frustrated customers.
