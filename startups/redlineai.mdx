  problem:
    - >-
      Redline incorporation from PDFs to DWG/RVT is slow and error-prone: 20–60
      minutes per sheet per revision cycle, with 2–4 cycles typical per project,
      consuming 10–20% of drafting hours.
    - >-
      Manual tracking of revision clouds, delta tags, and change logs is
      inconsistent, leading to missing updates, audit gaps, and downstream
      RFIs/COs.
    - >-
      Distributed teams (in-house/offshore) struggle with consistent standards
      across versions and disciplines (A/MEP/SE/Civ), increasing rework and
      coordination delays.
    - >-
      Existing tools capture markups but don’t reliably apply
      geometry/parametric changes inside CAD/BIM or maintain a structured change
      log tied to sheets/views.
    - >-
      Drafting managers lack measurable visibility into automation rate,
      accuracy, and time saved; ROI is hard to prove and optimize.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest PDFs (including Bluebeam markups) and associate them to sheet/view
      contexts via title block parsing and view tags.
    - >-
      Detect and classify markups (text edits, dimensions, move/rotate,
      add/delete elements, annotation changes, tag/parameter updates, delta
      callouts) using CV/OCR and symbol recognition.
    - >-
      Map markups to model elements or drawing objects (by IDs, bounding boxes,
      tags, room/view metadata) and auto-apply changes via Autodesk Platform
      Services (Design Automation) or local plug-ins.
    - >-
      Programmatically generate/update revision clouds, delta symbols, revision
      sequences, and sheet revision schedules consistent with project standards.
    - >-
      Produce a structured, immutable change log (JSON/CSV) with before/after
      diffs, authorship, timestamps, and reviewer approvals; enable one-click
      rollback.
    - >-
      Provide human-in-the-loop review queue with confidence scoring to route
      ambiguous changes for quick acceptance/correction; learn from feedback
      (active learning).
    - >-
      Integrations: Bluebeam Revu (markup import), Autodesk Docs/Build, Revizto,
      Procore; on-prem runner for secure environments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Apply 60–80% of PDF redlines into DWG/RVT automatically—with correct
    revision clouds, delta notes, and a searchable change log—cutting
    sheet-turnaround time by 40–60% while improving auditability and reducing
    RFIs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from real-world markup-to-change pairs across thousands
    of sheets and multiple disciplines, combined with deep APS-based
    write-access to DWG/RVT and a reviewer workflow that continuously improves
    model accuracy—difficult for general CAD tools to replicate quickly.

  character: >-
    Architects, drafters, and BIM managers who need redlines applied to DWG/RVT
    quickly, accurately, and with a clean revision record.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual redline incorporation is slow, error-prone, and
    inconsistent across sheets/models. Internal: You’re tired of chasing deltas,
    clouds, and notes at 2 a.m., worrying something slipped. Philosophical:
    Revisions should be automatic, traceable, and audit-ready—quality shouldn’t
    depend on heroics.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the production crunch and version chaos. Authority:
    Purpose-built for AEC; parses marked-up PDFs and applies updates to DWG/RVT
    while preserving revision clouds, delta notes, and a detailed change log.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload marked-up PDFs + source DWG/RVT. 2) Review AI-detected
    changes and mapping preview. 3) Approve to auto-apply edits with revision
    clouds, delta notes, and change log synced. Agreement: No changes without
    your approval; full rollback and audit trail; secure file handling.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot or book a demo. Transitional: Get a free sample change
    log from your test sheet.
  success: >-
    Turn 8-hour redlines into minutes; reduce misses; enforce consistency;
    maintain a clean revision history; hit submittal dates; protect fees; keep
    PMs and clients confident.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting—missed deltas, blown deadlines, rework, fee erosion, and
    messy audits.
