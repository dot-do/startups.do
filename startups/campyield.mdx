leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Most RV parks and campgrounds use static or seasonal rate sheets, leaving
      8–20% revenue on the table during peak demand and discounting too little
      in shoulder periods.
    - >-
      Manual price updates across PMS and multiple OTAs are error-prone, slow
      (often weekly), and lead to stale rates, double-bookings, or mismatched
      availability.
    - >-
      Operators lack visibility into competitors’ pricing, real-time demand
      signals (bookings pickup, events, weather), and channel performance to
      make confident pricing decisions.
    - >-
      Existing PMS “yield rules” are basic (if-then), not data-driven forecasts,
      and don’t adapt to site-type constraints, length-of-stay behavior,
      rig-size restrictions, or seasonal closures.
    - >-
      Multi-park operators can’t easily standardize pricing strategy, run A/B
      tests, or measure impact across portfolios.
    - >-
      Small teams don’t have time or expertise to run revenue management; they
      need automation with guardrails.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI pricing engine that forecasts demand by site type (pull-through,
      back-in, waterfront, 30/50-amp, cabins) and sets nightly/weekly rates,
      minimum stays, and restrictions.
    - >-
      Real-time signals: occupancy-on-the-books, pickup pace vs. last year/last
      7–30 days, local events, weather, competitor rates, and lead-time curves.
    - >-
      Inventory distribution: channel allocation, stop-sell/closeout, parity
      monitoring, and oversell protection across PMS and OTAs.
    - >-
      Rules + guardrails: floors/ceilings by season and site type, blackout
      dates, site-type differentials, and no-surprise safety checks.
    - >-
      Sync engine: 2–5 minute rate/availability pushes to PMS and connected
      channels (Campspot Marketplace, Spot2Nite, Hipcamp, RoverPass, The Dyrt;
      optionally Booking.com/Expedia for cabins/glamping).
    - >-
      Dashboards: RevPAR, ADR, occupancy, pickup heatmaps, channel mix, and
      forecast vs. actual; per-park and portfolio rollups.
    - >-
      Simulation sandbox: run what-if scenarios (e.g., NASCAR weekend + 70%
      occupancy target) and A/B test strategies.
    - >-
      Alerts: compression dates, anomalous pickup, event spikes, weather-driven
      demand impacts.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase campground revenue 8–15% in 90 days with AI-driven dynamic pricing
    and distribution that plugs into your PMS and pushes to OTAs in under 5
    minutes—set-it-and-forget-it automation with full control and clear ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, privacy-safe data network of first-party occupancy and pickup
    signals across parks, combined with PMS-certified integrations and
    RV-specific models that factor site-type constraints, rig-size, and
    event/weather demand—delivering measurable uplift and faster time-to-value
    than generic hotel/STR pricing tools or basic PMS rules.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    RV park and campground owners and managers who want to fill more sites,
    increase ADR, and stop manual repricing.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile demand, events, weather, and competitor moves make static
    pricing and manual inventory a guess. Internal: Owners feel overwhelmed by
    daily rate changes and channel syncing. Philosophical: Parks deserve
    hotel-grade revenue tools without hiring a full-time analyst.
  guide: >-
    An AI revenue and distribution platform built for RV parks. We understand
    site-type nuances and PMS/OTA quirks and provide transparent controls with
    hospitality best practices.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PMS and OTAs and import site types. 2) Set floors and ceilings,
    rules, blackout dates, and local events. 3) Go live as AI optimizes rates by
    site type and syncs availability continuously, with weekly insight reviews.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a live demo. Transitional: Request a market demand
    snapshot for your park.
  success: >-
    Right price, right site, right guest—higher revenue per site and occupancy,
    consistent rates across PMS and OTAs, fewer pricing headaches, smoother
    sell-outs on events and weekends, and more direct bookings.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing on price, leave money on the table, sit on empty pads during
    peak demand, suffer OTA and PMS mismatches, and waste hours repricing
    instead of serving guests.
