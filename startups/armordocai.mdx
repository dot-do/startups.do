leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Legacy technical manuals (PDF/Word/FrameMaker/MIL-STD-40051/38784) for
      armored vehicles and components are costly and slow to convert into S1000D
      data modules (DMs), with 6–12 month timelines common for large programs.
    - >-
      Program-specific BREX compliance is error-prone; first-pass validation
      rates under 60% create expensive rework and schedule risk.
    - >-
      ASD-STE language consistency is uneven across suppliers; readability and
      translation costs suffer, and government QA often mandates rewrites.
    - >-
      Shortage of S1000D/STE-experienced writers increases labor costs
      (>$120/hour) and creates delivery bottlenecks during program surges.
    - >-
      Updates and change propagation across interconnected DMs, illustrations,
      and parts catalogs are manual and brittle, leading to configuration
      control issues and audit findings.
    - >-
      Security, export control (ITAR/EAR), and on-prem/GovCloud deployment needs
      eliminate many generic AI tools from consideration.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion of Word/PDF/FrameMaker/DITA/MIL-STD TMs with layout,
      tables, warnings, callouts, and illustration references preserved.
    - >-
      AI-driven content segmentation and DMRL mapping with suggested DMCs,
      applicability, and metadata extraction (e.g., skill level, task times,
      tools, consumables).
    - >-
      BREX-aware authoring: real-time validation against program BREX; auto-fix
      suggestions with rationale and change traceability.
    - >-
      ASD-STE rewrite assistant: term-base enforcement, ambiguity detection, and
      style harmonization; configurable to program lexicons.
    - >-
      Illustration workflows: auto-link figures/ICNs, hazard symbol insertion
      per S1000D, and optional vectorization/annotation enrichment.
    - >-
      Configuration control: change packages, impact analysis, and cross-DM link
      integrity checks; version diff and redlining.
    - >-
      CSDB packaging/export: S1000D 4.1/5.0 XML, publication modules, IETP
      exports; connectors to common CSDBs and viewers.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: gated review steps for writers/SMEs with audit
      trails; reviewer assignment and acceptance criteria.
    - >-
      Security-first deployment: air-gapped/on-prem or AWS/Azure GovCloud;
      ITAR/EAR data handling; SSO, RBAC, audit logging.
    - >-
      Dashboards: BREX pass rate, STE score, conversion throughput, cost/time
      saved, and acceptance KPIs by program and supplier.
    - >-
      APIs and PLM integration: Teamcenter/Windchill links for part/LSA
      alignment; change triggers and data handshakes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Secure, defense-grade AI that converts legacy maintenance/repair content
    into validated S1000D data modules and rewrites text in ASD-STE, achieving
    3x faster delivery, 40–60% cost savings, ≥95% BREX first-pass validation,
    and ≥90 STE compliance—deployable on-prem or GovCloud and integrated with
    your CSDB/PLM.
