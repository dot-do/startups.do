  problem:
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection of chocolate-coated confectionery is subjective
      and inconsistent; false accepts/false rejects increase with fatigue and
      lighting variability.
    - >-
      Cosmetic defects (incomplete coating coverage, fat/sugar bloom, surface
      cracks) drive rework/scrap, customer complaints, and retailer chargebacks;
      typical cosmetic nonconformance is 0.5–3.0% of output for SMEs.
    - >-
      SME confectioners and co-packers lack budget and expertise for industrial
      inline vision systems; most lines have no automated appearance QC.
    - >-
      Lighting conditions on factory floors vary, making smartphone photos
      unreliable without a standardized protocol, undermining auditability and
      model performance.
    - >-
      Private-label contracts increasingly demand documented, lot-level
      appearance checks and traceability, which paper-based QC cannot provide
      efficiently.
    - >-
      Chocolate formulation and processing variability (temper, viscosity,
      humidity) cause intermittent bloom and cracking that operators often miss
      until late-stage checks or post-shipment feedback.
    - >-
      Training turnover in QA/production results in inconsistent defect criteria
      application and incomplete records.
  solution:
    - >-
      Mobile capture app with guided workflow (lot ID, product SKU, sampling
      plan) and live lighting/calibration check using a reference card.
    - >-
      Low-cost lightbox kit and color-calibration card ensuring consistent
      images from any modern smartphone.
    - >-
      Cloud AI models specialized for confectionery appearance: coverage
      quantification, bloom classification (fat vs sugar), crack detection, and
      severity scoring.
    - >-
      Real-time pass/fail decisions with configurable thresholds; operator
      guidance and rework prompts.
    - >-
      Web dashboard for QA: SPC charts, trend analysis by line/shift/lot,
      complaint correlation, and audit-ready exports (PDF/CSV).
    - >-
      Integrations: APIs/webhooks for MES/ERP/LIMS, and Slack/Email alerts for
      out-of-spec findings.
    - >-
      Continuous model improvement from anonymized opt-in data and customer
      feedback loops; per-product fine-tuning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Phone-first, standardized visual QC that detects coating coverage gaps,
    bloom, and cracks in minutes, cutting visible-defect escapes by up to 50%
    and cosmetic rework/scrap by 20–40% within 90 days—without installing
    cameras on the line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of confectionery-specific defects tied to
    controlled lighting and calibration metadata, enabling higher accuracy than
    generic vision tools; validated SOPs that make smartphone capture
    audit-grade; and channel access via chocolate suppliers and equipment OEMs
    that shortens sales cycles and embeds us in commissioning and QA workflows.

    secure auditable results
  plan: >-
    1) Set up the phone + simple lighting protocol (5‑minute guide or low‑cost
    lightbox). 2) Snap batch photos; AI scores coverage, detects bloom/cracks,
    and returns pass/fail with metrics. 3) Run a 2‑week pilot to tune
    thresholds, then integrate into QA SOP and supplier feedback
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 2‑week pilot now; or request the lighting protocol PDF and a sample
    QC report
  success: >-
    Consistent coating appearance every run; defects caught early; less scrap
    and rework; faster lot release; fewer complaints and chargebacks;
    standardized checks across sites; photo + AI records for audits; stronger
    supplier accountability; protected brand
  failure: >-
    Subjective inspections persist; bloom and cracks slip through; inconsistent
    product, higher waste and overtime, rejected shipments, chargebacks, and
    brand erosion
