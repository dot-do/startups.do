  problem:
    - >-
      Manual cocoa bean cut-tests are slow (10–20 minutes per lot) and
      subjective, with high inter-operator variability, leading to inconsistent
      grading and supplier disputes.
    - >-
      Lot quality data is siloed (paper, spreadsheets, photos on phones) and not
      linked to process or sensory outcomes, limiting predictive control and
      blend optimization.
    - >-
      Delayed lot release at ports/warehouses increases demurrage and storage
      costs; slow triage of off-spec lots impacts production schedules.
    - >-
      Current lab instrumentation (e.g., NIR) gives chemistry but not visual
      defect composition (mold, slaty, purple, insect damage) required by cocoa
      standards; combining both is hard in practice.
    - >-
      Craft and mid-size plants lack standardized, auditable digital workflows
      to comply with buyer specs and audits, increasing risk and rework.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision models detect and quantify cut-test defects (moldy, slaty,
      purple, insect-damaged, germinated, flat/broken) and estimate
      fermentation/roast readiness from standardized images.
    - >-
      Flavor potential and process risk scores predicted by linking image
      features with sensory panel outcomes and process/sensor data (moisture,
      temperature profiles).
    - >-
      Workflow app guides sampling per cocoa standards, enforces calibration,
      and auto-generates auditable reports and supplier scorecards.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors push results to LIMS/QMS/ERP/MES (e.g., SAP, Oracle,
      Infor) and data historians, enabling release workflows and blend
      optimization.
    - >-
      Edge-capable inference for low-connectivity sites; results sync to cloud
      for fleet analytics and continuous model improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Standardized, auditable, and predictive cocoa lot grading in minutes from
    cut‑test images and sensor data—reducing subjectivity, accelerating lot
    release, and optimizing blends for quality and flavor with measurable ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking standardized cut-test images to
    verified sensory and process outcomes across multiple origins and seasons,
    combined with validated SOPs, calibration hardware, and deep integrations
    into release workflows—hard for generalist vision providers or in-house
    teams to replicate quickly.

    QA managers, sourcing leads, and plant supervisors at chocolate and
    confectionery manufacturers (NAICS 311351) who need fast, objective
    cocoa‑bean lot grading and flavor potential prediction.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual cut‑tests are slow, subjective, and miss hidden defects;
    inconsistent supplier quality delays releases and raises costs. Internal:
    Teams feel uncertain about accept/blend decisions and risk flavor drift.
    Philosophical: Quality and price shouldn’t hinge on guesswork when data can
    be measured.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure to ship on time without sacrificing
    flavor or yield. Authority: Our team blends cocoa science with computer
    vision to deliver repeatable scoring and clear defect insights, with
    transparent metrics and pilot support.
  plan: >-
    Simple plan: 1) Connect—upload cut‑test images and sensor data or integrate
    a line camera; 2) Score—receive lot quality grade, defect breakdown, and
    flavor potential; 3) Act—accept, blend, or remediate, then track outcomes in
    a dashboard. Start with a small pilot, calibrate to your specs, and scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download the methodology
    brief and sample report.
  success: >-
    Confident buy and release decisions; consistent flavor profiles; higher
    yield and fewer rejects; faster QA cycle times; traceable, audit‑ready
    grading; better supplier alignment and pricing.
  failure: >-
    Persistent subjective grading leading to inconsistent products,
    over/underpaying for lots, production delays, higher waste, and preventable
    customer complaints.
