  problem:
    - >-
      Netlist mismatches between CAM data (Gerber/ODB++) and customer-supplied
      IPC-D-356A are discovered late at e-test, causing rework, retests, and
      schedule slips.
    - >-
      Manual netlist extraction and compare is slow, error-prone, and varies by
      operator, especially with complex stackups (blind/buried microvias,
      via-in-pad, step-and-repeat) and ambiguous Gerber data.
    - >-
      Existing tools lack automation at scale (batch, API), robust handling of
      poor or inconsistent input data, and closed-loop reporting to MES/CAM
      workflows.
    - >-
      High-mix factories struggle to maintain consistent pre-test checks across
      thousands of unique jobs/month, leading to avoidable escapes and delayed
      shipments.
    - >-
      Security and compliance constraints (ITAR/EAR, customer NDAs) make
      cloud-only solutions non-starters; on-prem capability is required without
      sacrificing modern AI capabilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted netlist extraction from Gerber RS-274X/X2 and ODB++ with drill
      (Excellon/Sieb&Meyer), recognizing connectivity across polygons, thermals,
      blind/buried vias, negative planes, and step-and-repeat panels.
    - >-
      Deterministic compare engine against IPC-D-356A with topology-aware
      heuristics to precisely identify opens/shorts, missing/extra connections,
      layer-to-layer mis-registrations, and polarity/unit mismatches.
    - >-
      Batch/API-driven workflow: drop a job or trigger via REST/CLI; receive
      standardized discrepancy reports (JSON/CSV/PDF), annotated images, and
      cross-probing back into CAM tools.
    - >-
      Panelization-aware checks: recognizes repeats, nets across sub-panels, and
      fixture/testpoint mapping to project e-test risk and expected coverage.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integrations with CAM/MES (Genesis/InCAM, UcamX, CAM350,
      Valor, Aegis/MES, Siemens Opcenter) for automated quality gates and
      electronic signoff.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: air-gapped on-prem appliance or private cloud
      with SOC 2 controls; role-based access; audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automatically extract a golden netlist from CAM data and compare it to
    IPC-D-356A to catch opens/shorts before e-test, reducing scrap and retests,
    accelerating preproduction by minutes per job, and integrating directly into
    existing CAM/MES workflows with enterprise-grade security (on-prem or
    private cloud).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-fab defect corpus and AI models tuned to real-world CAM
    quirks (negative planes, odd aperture macros, panelization edge cases)
    combined with deep, certified integrations into dominant CAM/MES tools and a
    secure on-prem option suitable for ITAR/EAR environments. This
    data+integration+security trifecta is difficult to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    CAM and test engineers at bare-board PCB manufacturers who must guarantee
    netlist integrity before electrical test.
  problem: >-
    - External: Gerber/CAM and IPC-D-356A often diverge; manual checks are slow
    and miss hidden opens/shorts that surface late at e-test.

    - Internal: Pressure and uncertainty about escapes, late-night debug, and
    missed ship dates.

    - Philosophical: Quality shouldn’t depend on heroics—every net deserves
    automatic, early verification.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the zero-escape pressure and tight turnarounds in bare
    PCB manufacturing.

    - Authority: AI purpose-built for PCB topology; standards-compliant
    IPC-D-356A parsing; production-proven comparisons; integrates with common
    CAM flows.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect/upload Gerbers (or CAM) and IPC-D-356A. 2) AI extracts
    a golden netlist from CAM and compares to IPC-D-356A. 3) Get a discrepancy
    report with visual overlays and root-cause hints. 4) Approve fixes/ECO, then
    export a clean netlist to e-test.

    - Agreement: Read-only by default; secure (on‑prem/air‑gapped options);
    simple subscription or per-panel pricing.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a pilot on your next job.

    - Transitional: Schedule a 20‑minute demo or download a sample discrepancy
    report.
  success: >-
    Find and fix opens/shorts before e-test, boost first-pass yield, shorten
    CAM/test cycles, reduce scrap/rework, provide an auditable QA trail, and
    ship on time with confidence.
  failure: >-
    Undetected opens/shorts slip to e-test or the customer, triggering scrap,
    retests, chargebacks, delays, and reputational damage.
