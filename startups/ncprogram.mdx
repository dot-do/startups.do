  problem:
    - >-
      Expensive crashes and overtravel alarms on lathes/Swiss machines cause
      unplanned downtime ($500–$1,500/hour) and scrap (single crash can cost
      $10k–$100k+).
    - >-
      High-mix/low-volume work and frequent post edits create inconsistent
      G-code quality and modal-state mistakes (units, G94/G95, G90/G91, coolant,
      tool offsets).
    - >-
      Dialect differences (Fanuc vs Okuma OSP vs Siemens vs Mitsubishi vs Haas;
      Swiss M-code packs for Citizen/Star/Tsugami) cause subtle, hard-to-catch
      errors.
    - >-
      Manual program reviews are slow, inconsistent, and depend on a few
      experts; turnover and shift work increase risk.
    - >-
      Full digital twin simulation tools are expensive, milling-centric, or lack
      deep turning/Swiss safety-state checks; many shops skip or underuse them.
    - >-
      Existing backplotters rarely check machine limits, safety interlocks,
      sub-spindle sync, or bar feeder/part catcher sequences.
    - >-
      OEM collision-avoidance options are machine-specific, costly, and don’t
      catch dialect/post issues before DNC transfer.
    - >-
      Auditable safety processes for ISO 9001/13485/AS9100 require consistent
      pre-machine validation, which is difficult to maintain.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dialect-aware G-code static analysis: parse and lint turning/Swiss
      programs for modal pitfalls (units, absolute/incremental, feed per rev vs
      per minute), offset calls, canned cycles, macro ranges, tool call
      consistency.
    - >-
      Machine envelope/limit checking: verify programmed moves against
      configured axis travels, spindle speeds, torque limits,
      chuck/tailstock/bushing positions, and turret index clearance envelopes.
    - >-
      Safety-state tracking: model chuck clamp/unclamp, spindle states, coolant,
      live tooling engagement, synchronization (M-codes, wait codes), bar feeder
      and part catcher sequences, sub-spindle handoffs.
    - >-
      Fast lightweight simulation for turning/Swiss: kinematics-aware motion
      check (no heavy graphics required) to catch collisions/overtravel and
      unsafe retractions; optional visual backplot and clearance cones.
    - >-
      Dialect packs: Fanuc, OSP, Siemens, Mitsubishi, Haas; Swiss OEM packs
      (Citizen/Star/Tsugami) with M-code semantics and sync codes; customizable
      post profiles per customer.
    - >-
      Integration points: CAM post-export hook, DNC/NC program managers (CIMCO,
      Predator), MES/ERP (ProShop), and a REST API/CLI for CI pipelines;
      optional on-prem agent.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: configurable policies to block/allow with
      warnings, assign review tasks, capture e-signoff; auto-generate PDF/JSON
      compliance reports attached to traveler/FAI.
    - >-
      Analytics and continuous learning: track incidents, near-misses,
      false-positive/negative resolutions; adapt rules to shop-specific posts
      and machines; library updates pushed monthly.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, dialect-aware static analysis plus fast machine-aware simulation
    for lathes and Swiss that flags overtravel, unsafe states, and post/dialect
    mismatches before the program hits the machine—cutting crashes by 50%+ and
    sign-off time by 30% while creating auditable safety trails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep specialization in turning/Swiss safety states and dialect semantics
    (beyond generic backplot or milling-focused simulation), combined with a
    growing proprietary rule and machine-model library co-developed with
    OEM/dealer partners and reinforced by anonymized real-world program feedback
    loops. This enables faster, more accurate, and cheaper pre-machine safety
    checks with auditable workflows that fit regulated shops.

  character: >-
    CNC programmers and process engineers in precision turned-part shops who
    need to release safe, production-ready NC programs for lathes and Swiss
    machines—fast and with confidence.
  problem: >-
    External: G-code mistakes, machine-dialect mismatches, and overtravel cause
    crashes, scrap, and downtime. Internal: Prove-outs are stressful and slow;
    confidence drops under delivery pressure. Philosophical: It shouldn’t take a
    crash to learn—safety should be built into programming.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve stood at the machine sweating first-part runs; crashes are
    costly and demoralizing. Authority: Built by CNC and AI veterans; validated
    on thousands of lathe/Swiss programs; supports major controls (Fanuc, Okuma,
    Mitsubishi; Citizen/Star/Tsugami) and shop workflows.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Upload/post G-code with machine and setup. 2) Run static
    checks (limits, interlocks, unsafe states, dialect). 3) Simulate kinematics
    for overtravel/collisions. 4) Get flagged lines with explanations and safe
    edits. 5) Export verified code and a compliance report. Agreement plan:
    Read-only by default, your approval for any edits, encrypted storage, easy
    DNC/PLM integration.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free safety scan or book a 20‑minute demo. Transitional:
    Download a sample safety report and the Swiss/lathe crash‑prevention
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Zero‑crash releases, faster prove‑outs, fewer tool and spindle incidents,
    standardized programming across machines/shifts, on‑time shipments, and
    measurable risk reduction per program.
  failure: >-
    Avoid crashes, broken tools, machine damage, overtime prove‑outs, missed
    delivery dates, and costly rework triggered by subtle G‑code and dialect
    errors.

  problem:
    - >-
      Crashes and overtravel from tiny code oversights cost time, tools, and
      spindles.
    - >-
      Dialect differences (Fanuc/Okuma/Siemens/Citizen/Star/Tsugami) trigger
      alarms on the floor.
    - Multi-channel sync and sub-spindle handoffs are hard to validate by eye.
    - Last-minute prove-outs burn spindle time and derail schedules.
    - 'Post quirks and shop edits create inconsistent, risky programs.'
    - Manual checklists miss edge cases; tribal knowledge doesn’t scale.
  solution:
    - Automated static linting flags unsafe states and code smells in seconds.
    - >-
      Physics-aware simulation verifies limits, kinematics, and collisions
      before the machine sees code.
    - >-
      Dialect-aware parsing prevents G/M-code incompatibilities per control and
      machine.
    - >-
      Swiss-specific logic validates guide bushing, pickup, cutoff, re-grip, and
      C-axis locking.
    - Severity-ranked warnings with suggested fixes reduce rework and risk.
    - >-
      Export machine-safe code plus an audit-ready report for signoff and
      traceability.

      Swiss lathe rules: guide bushing clearance, cutoff and pickup sequencing,
      re-grip checks, C-axis lock/unlock states.

      ranges, plane and polar mode consistency.
    - >-
      Auto-fixes: safe retracts, plane/mode priming, speed clamp normalization,
      coolant/spindle/chuck sequencing.
