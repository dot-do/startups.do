  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage massing and test-fit work is slow and iterative; producing
      5–10 viable options for a medium site typically takes 2–5 designer-days
      using Rhino/Revit/Grasshopper.
    - >-
      Manual compliance with zoning and building code constraints (FAR,
      setbacks, height limits, daylight planes, egress, parking) is error-prone
      and leads to costly rework when issues surface later.
    - >-
      Optimizing for competing objectives (GFA, daylight, circulation
      efficiency, unit mix, parking) is difficult to do objectively at speed
      with current tools.
    - >-
      Data and geometry handoffs between feasibility tools and BIM environments
      cause loss of fidelity and duplicated work.
    - >-
      Clients increasingly expect data-backed options and quick turnarounds;
      firms struggle to meet timelines without overstaffing or overtime.
    - >-
      Institutional knowledge is trapped in custom scripts and spreadsheets with
      single points of failure; talent churn disrupts continuity.
  solution:
    - >-
      Natural-language and structured program intake that converts briefs and
      site envelopes into parameterized constraints.
    - >-
      Code-aware constraint engine that encodes zoning/building rules (FAR,
      setbacks, height, lot coverage, daylight planes, egress distances, parking
      ratios) with explainable rule checks and warnings.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization producing 10–100 diverse options ranked by
      KPIs such as GFA, net-to-gross efficiency, sDA/ASE daylight metrics,
      average travel distances, unit mix coverage, and core efficiency.
    - >-
      One-click exports to Revit, Rhino/Grasshopper, IFC, and Speckle to
      preserve geometry, levels, and program metadata, reducing rework.
    - >-
      Automated studies and visualizations: shadow/daylight studies, circulation
      heatmaps, core placement suggestions, and quick cost and carbon
      approximations for comparative analysis.
    - >-
      Scenario management and versioning with side-by-side comparisons, audit
      trails of constraints/assumptions, and client-ready PDF/Excel reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate code-aware massing and test-fit options from a program brief in
    minutes, not days—optimize for GFA, daylight, and circulation with an
    auditable, BIM-ready workflow that reduces feasibility time by 70–90% and
    increases approval confidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Architects, developers, and design managers who need fast, defensible
    massing/test-fit options to unlock a site and win work.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual test fits are slow, subjective, and brittle when briefs or
    site rules change. Internal: Teams are under pressure to respond in hours,
    not weeks, with limited staff time. Philosophical: Early design should be
    data-informed, not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We’re architects and computational designers who built an AI workflow for
    feasibility. We understand planning envelopes, program ratios,
    egress/daylight constraints, and the need for client-ready logic. We help
    you defend choices with transparent metrics and option histories.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload the program and site envelope. 2) Set objectives and constraints
    (GFA targets, daylight, circulation, setbacks). 3) Generate and compare
    massing/test-fit options with scores and trade-offs. 4) Iterate, lock
    favorites, and export geometry and reports.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot on a live site. Transitional: Book a 20‑minute demo
    and review a sample study.
  success: >-
    Confident early decisions; optimized GFA while meeting daylight/circulation
    targets; fewer redesign loops; clearer client buy-in; faster proposals;
    traceable rationale and exports ready for the next design stage.
  failure: >-
    Weeks lost on manual studies; missed opportunities and over/underbuilt GFA;
    daylight or circulation misses discovered late; shaky stakeholder
    confidence; lost bids.
