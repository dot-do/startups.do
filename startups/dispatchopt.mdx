  title: Daily Dispatch and Route–Load Assignment Optimizer
  description: >-
    Optimizes same-day local specialized loads to trucks/equipment with time
    windows, certs, and constraints; live re-optimizes on disruptions.
  targetUsers:
    - Dispatchers
    - Operations managers
    - Small–mid specialized local fleets
  triggers:
    - New orders drop from TMS/EDI/email
    - Driver/equipment availability change
    - Hotshot request

  risks:
    - Bad/late order data hurts plans
    - 'Missing constraint (e.g., hazmat cert) could cause service failure'
    - Driver adoption/communication gaps
  dependencies:
    - TMS and telematics API access
    - Driver contact channel (SMS/app)
    - Accurate equipment/cert data
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual daily dispatch for local specialized freight (hazmat, heavy haul,
      tankers, cranes, concrete pumps, roll-off) takes 1–3 hours and is
      error-prone, causing 5–12% missed/slipped time windows and 10–20% empty or
      out-of-route miles.
    - >-
      Incorrect skill/cert/equipment assignment (e.g., hazmat, TWIC, crane
      certification, escort-car, axle/weight limits) leads to trip aborts and
      rework on 1–3% of loads, with average $350–$1,200 per incident.
    - >-
      Real-time disruptions (job cancellations, site delays, traffic, weather,
      driver sick calls, equipment breakdown) are handled by phone/text, not
      systems, causing 30–60 minutes of latency before replan and 8–15% overtime
      overages.
    - >-
      Most TMS/telematics tools lack advanced constraint-based optimization.
      Fleets resort to whiteboards/spreadsheets, producing 10–15% utilization
      gaps (loads per truck/day) and dispatchers maxed at 25–40 trucks/person.
    - >-
      Compliance risks: improper placarding/routes, restricted roads, and
      union/shift rule violations expose fleets to fines and safety incidents;
      rules aren’t codified into planning tools.
    - >-
      Customers increasingly demand narrow delivery windows and live ETAs;
      current systems can’t maintain 95%+ on-time performance without costly
      buffer padding.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based route–load assignment optimizer (VRP with time windows,
      capacities, skills/certs, union/shift rules, axle/weight and road
      restrictions).
    - >-
      Live re-optimization engine that consumes telematics/ELD pings, job
      status, traffic, weather, cancellations, and equipment availability to
      replan in under 2 minutes.
    - >-
      Cert/skill and equipment-matching rules engine: hazmat, TWIC,
      RFI/restricted sites, crane class, pump length, escort requirements,
      placarding, spill kits, PPE.
    - >-
      What-if simulation sandbox to test tomorrow’s jobs, weather scenarios, and
      equipment outages; ROI reporting on miles, dwell, overtime, and service
      level.
    - >-
      Driver app/portal integration: turn-by-turn compliant routing, stop
      sequence, required docs, site notes, checklists; customer ETA links and
      geofenced arrival/departure.
    - >-
      Plug-in connectors for major TMS/ELD/telematics and permitting systems;
      API-first for custom data flows and automated job import.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Local specialized-freight dispatchers and ops leaders who must match
    certified drivers and equipment to same-day loads and hit every time window.
  problem: >-
    Constant last-minute changes, tight windows, and strict certifications and
    equipment constraints make manual dispatch slow and error-prone—leading to
    missed appointments, idle assets, and stressed teams.
  guide: >-
    We understand same-day specialized freight chaos. Our AI co-pilot
    continuously assigns and re-optimizes loads to certified drivers and
    equipment in real time, honoring windows, compliance, and business
    rules—even when loads change, trucks break, or traffic hits.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect TMS/ELD, load feeds, and maps; 2) Configure windows, certs,
    equipment, service times, and rules; 3) Go live with dispatcher-in-the-loop
    or auto-assign and live re-optimization; 4) Review KPIs and fine-tune
    weekly.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30-minute dispatch assessment and start a 14-day live pilot.
  success: >-
    On-time pickups and deliveries, higher utilization, less deadhead and
    overtime, auditable compliance, calmer dispatch, and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting, missed windows, compliance risk, rush fees and
    overtime, lost customers, and dispatcher burnout.
