  problem:
    - >-
      Operators and growers cannot see or quantify in-field header and separator
      losses during harvest, leading to 0.5–3.0 bu/ac of avoidable grain left in
      the field.
    - >-
      Manual methods (drop pans, visual counts) are time-consuming, unsafe
      around moving machinery, and produce sparse, non-geolocated measurements
      with high human error.
    - >-
      Existing combine loss sensors provide relative indications, not
      calibrated, spatially resolved, absolute loss maps; OEM automation (e.g.,
      sieve/rotor auto-adjust) lacks independent ground-truth verification.
    - >-
      Loss varies with micro-topography, moisture, crop conditions, and
      settings; without heatmaps, operators overgeneralize from a few checks and
      miss problem zones.
    - >-
      Advisors and retailers lack an objective, scalable way to demonstrate ROI
      of harvest setting changes to customers during short harvest windows.
    - >-
      Custom harvesters need fast, repeatable documentation of loss performance
      to win and retain contracts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Smartphone and drone image capture workflows with AR guidance for
      consistent sampling (grid or adaptive).
    - >-
      AI models detect and count dropped kernels/ears/pods and thresh losses on
      the ground; convert to calibrated bu/ac (or t/ha) by crop and row spacing.
    - >-
      Field-level heatmaps and hotspots identify where header vs. separator
      losses dominate; exportable as GeoTIFF/MBTiles/Shape/ISOXML.
    - >-
      Actionable setting engine linking loss signatures to adjustment playbooks
      (e.g., rotor speed, fan, concave, sieve, header angle, reel speed, ground
      speed).
    - >-
      Closed-loop workflow: re-sample after adjustments to verify improvement;
      automatic before/after and ROI reporting.
    - >-
      Integrations: John Deere Operations Center, CNH AFS, AGCO Fuse, Climate
      FieldView, DroneDeploy/Pix4D/Sentera for capture and data sync.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quantify real, dollarized harvest loss in minutes and turn it into precise
    heatmaps and machine-setting advice. Typical users recover 0.5–1.5 bu/ac
    within the first day of use; 10-minute turnaround from image upload to
    recommendations; integrates with major FMIS and dealer workflows to document
    savings and adjustments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking ground-truth loss imagery with
    machine settings, crop conditions, and outcomes, enabling a recommendation
    engine that not only measures loss but reliably reduces it within minutes.
    Closed-loop evidence (before/after + ROI) builds trust and creates switching
    costs for operators, dealers, and advisors.
