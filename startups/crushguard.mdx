  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime from bearing/gearbox/motor failures on crushers,
      screens, and conveyor drives causes 3–8% production losses; typical cost
      of lost throughput is $1,500–$4,000 per hour for mid-size quarries
      (500–1,000 tph).
    - >-
      Failures are often detected late due to high dust, variable loads, and
      shock events that mask early warning signs in traditional vibration
      routes; routes are monthly/quarterly, while failures can develop in days.
    - >-
      Reactive maintenance inflates costs: emergency repairs and overtime
      increase part/labor spend by 20–40% versus planned work; catastrophic
      crusher bearing failures can exceed $50k–$150k (parts, crane, labor,
      downtime).
    - >-
      Fragmented data (vibration, temperature, power) and no automated link to
      CMMS leads to delayed action; work orders are created manually with
      inconsistent prioritization.
    - >-
      Reliability staff are thinly stretched; many sites lack on-site analysts
      and need rugged, low-maintenance sensors that survive dust, water, and
      impact.
    - >-
      Safety risk rises during breakdowns (MSHA recordables during reactive
      work) and rushed recovery efforts; leadership targets fewer reactive
      callouts and better predictability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy IP68 wireless vibration/temperature sensors on crusher bearings,
      screen exciters, conveyor head/tail drives; add power metering at MCCs to
      capture current, harmonics, and power factor.
    - >-
      Edge gateway filters high-shock/variable-load noise, synchronizes sensors,
      and streams data via cellular/Wi‑Fi to cloud; offline buffering ensures
      zero data loss.
    - >-
      AI models tailored to crushers/screens (envelope analysis, order tracking,
      kurtosis/crest factor under variable speed/load) plus power signature
      analytics for early motor/gearbox issues.
    - >-
      Automated anomaly detection with Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimates;
      prescriptive guidance mapping faults to likely root causes (misalignment,
      lubrication, looseness, bearing defects, belt slip).
    - >-
      Two-way CMMS integration (SAP PM, IBM Maximo, Oracle eAM, eMaint, Fiix,
      UpKeep): auto-create prioritized work orders with tasks, labor estimates,
      and parts; close-loop feedback improves models.
    - >-
      Mobile/web dashboards for operators with line-of-sight to production
      impact and safety critical alerts; configurable alert thresholds tied to
      throughput and shift schedules.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 1–2 day pilot install per site, baseline learning
      2–4 weeks, ROI review at 8–12 weeks; standard SOPs for lubrication and
      alignment interventions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict failures on crushers, screens, and conveyors weeks in advance with
    quarry-tuned AI that fuses vibration, temperature, and power
    data—automatically creating CMMS work orders with parts and job plans.
    Ruggedized, fast to deploy, and proven to cut unplanned downtime 30–50% with
    payback in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, domain-specific library of fault signatures and RUL models for
    crushers/screens under variable feed and shock loads—co-developed with OEMs
    and validated across multiple quarries—plus closed-loop CMMS outcomes that
    continuously improve model accuracy. Ruggedized deployment playbook yields
    rapid time-to-value and lower sensor attrition than generic PdM solutions.
