  problem:
    - >-
      High-cost unplanned downtime on longwall faces (AFC chain breaks, shearer
      gearbox failures, motor trips) routinely costs $30k–$150k per hour and can
      consume 10–20% of scheduled production time.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time, quantified insight into mechanical/thermal
      stress on shearer and AFC components; alarms are threshold-based, noisy,
      and site-generic.
    - >-
      Setpoints (haulage speed, drum horizon/traction control parameters, AFC
      speed/torque limits) are often static or based on operator feel, not
      data-driven safe operating windows for varying geology and face
      conditions.
    - >-
      Data exists but is siloed: PMC/shearer/AFC telemetry, SCADA, maintenance
      logs, and production reports are not fused into actionable guidance.
    - >-
      Excessive stress events accelerate component wear (chain stretch, drum
      picks wear, gearbox bearing life), inflating maintenance CAPEX/OPEX and
      increasing safety risk.
    - >-
      Regulatory and insurer pressure requires demonstrable risk reduction
      without adding complexity to operator workflows.
    - >-
      OEM analytics often focus on single equipment classes, not the integrated
      longwall system behaviors and face-specific conditions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an on-prem analytics engine that ingests PMC/shearer/AFC data
      (e.g., motor currents, gearbox temps, vibrations, chain tension, hydraulic
      pressures, haulage speed, drum power, AFC torque) via OPC
      UA/Modbus-TCP/PROFINET and mine SCADA.
    - >-
      Fuse telemetry with production logs, maintenance histories, and
      geology/face conditions to compute a Longwall Stress Index and
      component-specific health scores in real time.
    - >-
      Generate safe operating windows for key setpoints (haulage speed, drum
      depth/height aggressiveness, AFC speed/torque limits, shields pressure
      bands) tuned to current conditions.
    - >-
      Provide actionable, ranked advisories (what to change, by how much,
      expected impact on stress/tonnage) with operator acknowledgment workflows.
    - >-
      Issue predictive alerts with lead times (e.g., 2–24 hours) for high-risk
      events such as AFC chain overload, shearer gearbox thermal runaway, or
      repeated motor trip precursors.
    - >-
      Offer shift and daily reports quantifying stress events, time-in-window,
      production impact, and recommended maintenance actions.
    - >-
      Integrate with work management (e.g., on-surface CMMS) to auto-generate
      inspections when stress thresholds are breached repeatedly.
    - >-
      Deliver model transparency: show which signals/conditions drive each
      advisory to build operator trust and support training.
    - >-
      Support offline/sandbox “what-if” simulations of setpoint strategies under
      forecast geology and ventilation constraints.
    - >-
      Maintain site-specific calibration and continuous improvement via feedback
      loops and post-event root cause analytics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned longwall downtime 15–25% and component stress excursions
    30–50% within 90 days by turning PMC/shearer/AFC data into real-time safe
    setpoint windows and early warnings—delivered on-prem, OEM-agnostic, and
    operator-friendly.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-OEM, physics-informed dataset and modeling approach that fuses
    shearer, AFC, and PMC signals into a single stress index, combined with
    proven pilot playbooks and operator-trusted advisories—difficult for OEMs
    (siloed by equipment) or generic PdM vendors (lacking mining physics) to
    replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Longwall operations leaders (production, maintenance, geotech) who want to
    hit targets, keep crews safe, and protect equipment by making decisions from
    real-time PMC/shearer/AFC intelligence—not gut feel.
  problem: >-
    - External: Hidden face/roof stress, variable geology, machine overloads,
    and noisy data scattered across systems.

    - Internal: Anxiety about unseen risks and unplanned downtime while under
    pressure to deliver.

    - Philosophical: Safety and productivity shouldn’t be a trade-off—decisions
    should be evidence-based.

    - Villain: Invisible stress events that cascade into stalls, chain trips,
    and costly repairs.
  guide: >-
    We understand how hard it is to balance advance rate, shield health, and
    compliance underground. Our team combines longwall engineers and AI
    specialists. The Advisor learns from your PMC/shearer/AFC signals to flag
    stress early and recommend safe setpoint windows. Field-tested on historical
    and live data; built for OT reliability, explainability, and data security
    (read-only by default).
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect — Ingest PMC/shearer/AFC and historian data via secure,
    read-only interfaces.

    - Step 2: Calibrate — Align models with site geology, equipment limits, and
    SOPs; agree success metrics.

    - Step 3: Advise — Receive live risk scores, alerts, and recommended
    setpoint windows with reasons; review in shift reports.

    - Assurance: On-prem/edge capable; no autonomous control; you own your data;
    start with a low-risk pilot on one panel.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute pilot scoping call.

    - Transitional: Request a free stress-signature assessment using historical
    shifts and a sample advisory report.
  success: >-
    Stable, predictable production within safe envelopes; fewer overloads and
    shield-pressure excursions; reduced unplanned downtime and maintenance cost;
    clearer operator guidance; documented ALARP justification and audit-ready
    reports; higher confidence across crews and management.
  failure: >-
    Continue flying blind into stress events; more stalls, chain trips, and
    component wear; longer downtime; jittery advance rates; operator fatigue;
    potential regulatory scrutiny after avoidable incidents; lost tonnes left in
    the panel.

  problem:
    - >-
      Stress on chains, drives, and gearboxes is invisible until it becomes
      downtime.
    - Static setpoints force a trade‑off between safety margin and tons.
    - Alarm floods hide the few signals that matter for the face right now.
    - 'PMC, shearer, AFC, and shield data sit in silos—no holistic view.'
    - Unplanned stops and recovery cycles erode shift performance and morale.
  solution:
    - Continuously model equipment stress from PMC/shearer/AFC signals.
    - 'Surface early warnings before overloads, stalls, or chain events.'
    - >-
      Recommend safe, production‑maximizing setpoint windows in real time
      (shearer speed, depth of cut, AFC speed, shield advance cadence).
    - Provide clear operator actions with confidence and rationale.
    - 'Adapt to panel, geology, and wear—improves with each shift.'
    - Advisory‑only by default; respects site rules and hard limits.
