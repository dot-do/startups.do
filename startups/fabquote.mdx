leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive by email with mixed attachments (PDFs, STEP/DXF, BOM
      spreadsheets). Estimators spend 20–45 minutes per RFQ re-keying data,
      extracting dimensions, materials, and tolerances, leading to quoting
      backlogs.
    - >-
      Slow quotes lose jobs: buyers often award to first acceptable quote. Many
      shops respond in 24–72 hours; target buyers expect <12 hours, especially
      for repeat/low-complexity parts.
    - >-
      Inconsistent costing and manual errors (missed finishes, incorrect
      quantities, outdated material/labor rates) cause 2–5% margin leakage and
      occasional loss-making orders.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems: Outlook/Shared Drive + CAD + ERP/Excel. Double entry
      into ERP (JobBOSS2, ProShop, E2, Global Shop Solutions) creates 10–15%
      data errors and low quote traceability.
    - >-
      Capacity constraints: experienced estimators are scarce. Shops cap growth
      because quote volume cannot scale without hiring, with fully burdened
      estimator cost at $85k–$120k/year.
  solution:
    - >-
      Email and portal ingestion: monitor RFQ inboxes and procurement portals;
      auto-collect attachments and metadata.
    - >-
      Technical parsing: OCR + CAD/geometry parsing (PDF, STEP, DXF) to extract
      dimensions, material/specs, tolerances (GD&T), finishes, quantities, and
      due dates.
    - >-
      Cost modeling: configurable process models (laser/waterjet, press brake,
      machining, welding, finishing) using shop-specific labor/machine rates,
      setup/run times, scrap, yield, and material price feeds.
    - >-
      Risk and DFM flags: highlight missing tolerances, ambiguous notes, edge
      cases; suggest clarifying questions.
    - >-
      Quote generation: price recommendations with rationale, lead-time
      estimates, and tiered pricing by quantity breaks.
    - >-
      Communication: draft buyer-facing quote email and PDF; attach terms,
      certifications, and sales notes; log in CRM if present.
    - >-
      ERP write-back: create/update quote records, BOM, routings, and costing in
      ERP via secure connectors.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: estimator reviews/edits in a web UI; feedback loops
      retrain models to the shop’s norms.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate costed, accurate quotes from messy RFQs and drawings in minutes,
    not hours—auto-drafting buyer-ready emails and creating clean ERP quote
    entries—so shops quote more, win more, and protect margins without adding
    headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific dataset and models for fabricated metal RFQs and drawings,
    enriched by feedback loops from live estimator edits across many shops
    (privacy-preserving), combined with prebuilt deep ERP integrations and a
    human-in-the-loop bench for high-complexity parts—delivering provable ROI
    within 60–90 days that generic LLM or generic quoting tools struggle to
    match.
