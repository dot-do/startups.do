  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, seasonal demand across regions (freeze–thaw cycles, hurricane
      season, exterior vs. interior seasonality) causes chronic overstock of
      some SKUs and stockouts of others.
    - >-
      Traditional ERP min/max and simple moving averages underperform for
      intermittent and project-driven items (brushes, tapes, sprayers, solvents,
      specialty coatings), leading to high WAPE (>35%) at SKU–location level.
    - >-
      Contractor project pipelines (bids, permits, scheduled jobs) aren’t
      systematically used in forecasting, missing early demand signals for big
      pulls on primers, exterior paints, sealers, and sundries.
    - >-
      Lead-time variability (hazmat shipping, winter storms, carrier capacity)
      isn’t modeled, causing mis-set safety stocks and late POs.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon inventory (DCs feeding branches) is manually balanced;
      transfers are reactive, causing stranded stock and emergency
      replenishments/expedites.
    - >-
      Supplier constraints (MOQs, case packs, vendor calendars) and regulatory
      differences (low-VOC state rules) aren’t embedded in reorder logic,
      creating waste and compliance risks.
    - >-
      Tint-base/colorant relationships and attribute substitution (sheen,
      coverage, brand tier) are rarely modeled, increasing dead stock and lost
      sales.
    - >-
      Planners spend excessive time in spreadsheets reconciling reports instead
      of managing exceptions and value-add scenarios.
  solution:
    - >-
      High-granularity forecasting at SKU–location with seasonality, weather,
      and contractor signals; models tuned for intermittent and project-driven
      demand.
    - >-
      Optimized purchase order and inter-warehouse transfer recommendations that
      respect MOQs, case packs, vendor calendars, hazmat rules, and
      service-level targets by ABC class.
    - >-
      Lead time forecasting (and variability) by supplier–lane; dynamic safety
      stock recalculation for target fill rate/OTIF.
    - >-
      Multi-echelon optimization to balance stock between DCs and branches,
      minimizing expedites and stranded inventory.
    - >-
      Tint-base/colorant and attribute-aware demand modeling (sheen, base,
      coverage, brand tier) to improve substitutions and reduce dead stock.
    - >-
      Scenario planning workbench (promotions, price changes, supplier delays,
      budget caps) with measurable impact (WOS, turns, fill rate).
    - >-
      One-click ERP integration to generate POs/transfers and closed-loop
      learning from acceptance/override feedback.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI forecasting and replenishment built for paint and sundry distribution:
    SKU–location accuracy with seasonality and contractor project signals,
    producing ready-to-execute POs and transfer plans that raise fill rate 3–6
    pts and cut inventory 10–20% within 2–3 quarters.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and constraint libraries for paint/coatings
    distribution (tint-base/colorant logic, VOC compliance, hazmat and
    temperature constraints) combined with proprietary contractor pipeline and
    weather signals; growing feedback data network on supplier lead times and
    seasonality by climate zone; deep ERP connectors that shorten time-to-value.

  character: >-
    Ops and purchasing leaders at paint, varnish, and supplies merchant
    wholesalers (NAICS 424950) who want high fill rates, lower inventory, and
    loyal contractor accounts without living in spreadsheets.
  problem: >-
    External: seasonal/weather swings, project-driven surges, supplier
    variability, HazMat/case-pack constraints across thousands of SKU–locations;
    Internal: buyers firefight stockouts and emergency transfers, don’t trust
    forecasts, waste hours in manual planning; Philosophical: stocking the right
    paint shouldn’t be guesswork—your data should buy with confidence.
  guide: >-
    We understand paint distribution complexity—tints, sheens, case-packs,
    DOT/HazMat, and branch calendars. Our AI forecasts at SKU–location using
    seasonality and contractor project signals and outputs PO and inter-branch
    transfer suggestions; with supply-chain expertise, ERP-friendly
    integrations, and enterprise-grade security, we’re a trusted guide.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/POS, inventory, lead times, quotes/bids/permits; 2) Model
    seasonality and contractor project signals at SKU–location; 3) Generate
    forecasts; 4) Produce PO and transfer recommendations honoring MOQ,
    case-pack, truckload, and lead times; 5) Review/approve in workflow; 6) Sync
    to ERP. Pilot fast with clear KPIs and success criteria.

    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 60‑day pilot; Transitional: Get a
    free demand diagnostic and forecast accuracy baseline.
  success: >-
    Higher fill rates and on-time contractor projects; fewer stockouts and
    expedites; lower inventory with better turns; fewer branch-to-branch
    emergencies; hours back to buyers; confident seasonal buys and happier
    customers.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing guesswork leads to stockouts, obsolete/aging inventory, cash tied in
    the wrong SKUs, margin erosion from rush freight/discounts, lost key
    accounts, and a burned-out purchasing team.
