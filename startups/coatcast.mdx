  problem:
    - >-
      Intermittent and long-tail SKU demand (10–40% of SKUs sell <1 unit/week)
      causes high MAPE (25–45%) and safety stock bloat.
    - >-
      Long raw-material lead times (8–16 weeks for PET base; 4–8 weeks for
      silver salts/binders) misalign with weekly coating campaigns, creating
      frequent shortages and expedites.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers (emulsion, color, base width/thickness,
      hopper configuration) consume 15–30% of available coater time in many
      plants.
    - >-
      Emulsion/toner batch shelf life and temperature sensitivity lead to 3–7%
      scrap from expiry or off-spec rework.
    - >-
      Siloed planning—demand planning in spreadsheets, production scheduling in
      MES/whiteboards—causes low plan adherence (<70%) and firefighting.
    - >-
      Price volatility of silver and petrochemicals leads to unoptimized
      allocation across SKUs and erratic COGS.
    - >-
      Finite-capacity constraints (kettle size, dryer limits, tenter frames,
      slitting/finishing, crew shifts) aren’t captured in MRP, causing
      infeasible plans.
    - >-
      Quality/yield variability (e.g., ±3–8% yield by width and speed) isn’t
      reflected in plans, causing OTIF misses (target 95%, actual 85–92%).
    - >-
      Regulatory/environmental constraints (silver recovery, solvent emissions)
      limit campaign lengths yet are rarely encoded in planning tools.
    - >-
      Limited scenario capability—planners can’t quickly test “what if silver
      price spikes 20%” or “one coater down for 3 days,” delaying decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand module: Hierarchical and intermittent-SKU forecasting with external
      signals (camera/lab volumes, distributor inventory, promo calendars).
    - >-
      Planning module: Weekly 13–26 week rolling feasible plan using MILP/CP
      optimizer with capacity, changeover, material, and shelf-life constraints.
    - >-
      Materials module: Multi-echelon inventory and MRP with supplier lead
      times, MOQ/campaign sizing, and silver/PET allocation optimization.
    - >-
      Coating/Compounding Co-Pilot: Natural-language what-if, root-cause
      analysis, guided S&OP playbooks, and explainable recommendations.
    - >-
      Scenario studio: Stress-test plans for outages, price shocks, rush orders;
      compute service, cost, and capacity trade-offs.
    - >-
      Integration layer: Connectors for SAP/Oracle/D365, MES, LIMS, historians;
      continuous data quality checks and master data governance.
    - >-
      Value tracking: Live KPIs (MAPE, OTIF, turns, changeovers, scrap, plan
      adherence) with baselines and savings attribution.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven forecasting and finite-capacity planning that cuts changeovers
    20–35%, reduces expired/emulsion scrap 2–5%, improves SKU-level service
    level by 3–8 pts, and frees 5–10% capacity—purpose-built for film, paper,
    plate, chemical, and toner manufacturing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt coating/compounding planning templates with sequence-dependent
    changeovers, emulsion shelf-life models, and silver/PET allocation—codified
    from domain SMEs—plus explainable co-pilot workflows and connectors
    purpose-built for imaging media. Early lighthouse deployments generate
    proprietary parameter priors (yield, changeover, contamination) that
    accelerate time-to-value and are hard to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant schedulers, supply chain planners, and operations leaders in
    photographic film, paper, plate, chemical, and copy toner manufacturing who
    need reliable SKU forecasts and executable weekly coating/compounding plans.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile SKU mix; long/variable lead times for silver nitrate, PET
    base, and binders; constrained coaters/compounders; sequence-dependent
    changeovers; campaign and shelf-life/aging constraints.

    Internal: Constant firefighting; spreadsheets and generic MRP can’t keep up;
    low confidence when making promise dates.

    Philosophical: Planning analog imaging products should be science, not
    guesswork—every plan should be feasible before it’s published.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand midnight re-plans, legacy equipment limits, and
    regulatory/quality demands unique to imaging chemicals and coated products.

    Authority: Domain-tuned probabilistic forecasting plus constraint-based
    optimization built for web coating and specialty chemicals; integrates with
    ERP/MES; human-in-the-loop approvals and auditability.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect ERP/MES, BOMs, routings, inventory; 2) Calibrate
    SKU-level demand (seasonality, promotions, intermittency); 3) Encode
    constraints (coater widths, layer stacks, kettle sizes, changeover matrices,
    curing/aging windows, material availability); 4) Generate feasible weekly
    plan and what-if scenarios; 5) Review, approve, and publish to execution.

    Agreement: Pilot one site/line in 6 weeks; keep current tools; data stays
    private; clear success criteria and easy exit.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute discovery and start a 6-week pilot.

    Transitional: Get the feasibility checklist, sample plan, and an ROI range
    based on your SKU portfolio.
  success: >-
    OTIF improves with plans you can trust; unnecessary changeovers and scrap
    drop; raw-material drawdowns stabilize; asset utilization rises; planners
    run scenarios in minutes; sales, planning, and manufacturing align around a
    single, feasible weekly plan.
  failure: >-
    Without this, expect recurring stockouts/backorders, rush changeovers,
    scrapped emulsions/expired chemicals, overtime and missed ship dates,
    bloated safety stocks tying up silver/PET, and eroding credibility with
    customers and finance.
