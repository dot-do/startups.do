leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Youth and families in child welfare, behavioral health, and school-based
      programs miss 20–40% of appointments due to complex schedules,
      transportation gaps, and consent/guardian coordination.
    - >-
      Caseworkers and care coordinators spend 4–8 hours/week per caseload on
      manual scheduling, reminder calls, and transportation logistics, reducing
      time for high-value activities.
    - >-
      Providers lose revenue and care plans fall behind when appointments are
      missed or rescheduled late; court-ordered or IEP-related timelines are
      often breached.
    - >-
      Transportation for minors is fragmented: NEMT eligibility rules, rideshare
      age restrictions, and guardian accompaniment requirements create failure
      points.
    - >-
      Existing tools (EHR schedulers, calendars, referral networks) don’t
      coordinate multi-party scheduling across agencies, guardians, and
      providers, nor do they automate consent and documentation.
    - >-
      Language, digital access, and literacy barriers reduce engagement with
      appointment reminders and instructions.
    - >-
      Compliance burdens (HIPAA/FERPA/42 CFR Part 2/TCPA) make agencies
      risk-averse to texting, rideshare, and third-party booking without a
      compliant, auditable workflow.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI scheduling that reads provider availability, agency constraints, and
      family preferences to propose 3–5 optimal times, then books automatically
      once confirmed.
    - >-
      Two-way, multilingual reminders via SMS/WhatsApp/voice with smart
      follow-ups and auto-rescheduling when conflicts arise; consent and
      TCPA-compliant opt-ins built in.
    - >-
      Transportation orchestration through Uber Health/Lyft Healthcare,
      HopSkipDrive (minors), and Medicaid NEMT brokers (e.g., Modivcare/MTM)
      with eligibility checks and documentation.
    - >-
      Optional childcare coordination with vetted partners for sibling care
      during appointments; reimbursement workflows where applicable.
    - >-
      Integration with EHRs/case management systems to write back scheduled
      appointments, attendance, transport status, and case notes.
    - >-
      Guardian and multi-stakeholder coordination (youth, guardian, foster
      parent, caseworker, provider, court officer) including permission flows
      and audit trails.
    - >-
      Automated documentation: encounter notes, consent capture,
      proof-of-transportation, and court-compliant attendance reports.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A compliant, AI-powered coordinator that proposes times, books multi-party
    appointments, sends multilingual reminders, and arranges transportation and
    childcare—reducing no-shows 30–50%, saving staff 4+ hours/week, and
    accelerating care plan compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A compliant, cross-agency scheduling and transport orchestration engine for
    minors, built on deep integrations with EHR/case systems and minors-capable
    transport partners, plus proprietary attendance-risk and consent
    workflows—difficult for point tools or single-organization schedulers to
    replicate.

  character: >-
    Child & Youth Services caseworkers, caregivers, and teens who need
    hassle-free scheduling, reminders, and logistics for time‑critical
    appointments.
  problem: >-
    External: too many providers, shifting calendars, transport/childcare gaps
    cause missed or late appointments. Internal: overwhelmed, anxious about
    dropping the ball. Philosophical: kids shouldn’t miss care or court because
    adults are overextended.
  guide: >-
    We understand the strain of coordinating school, medical, therapy, and court
    with limited time. Our privacy‑first AI coordinator is built for
    child‑serving agencies, integrates with calendars and provider workflows,
    and keeps clear audit trails with consent controls.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect calendars and set youth/caregiver preferences. 2) Share provider
    types and constraints; we propose and confirm times. 3) We send reminders
    and, when needed, arrange transportation and childcare. Commitments:
    consent‑driven, human override anytime, transparent notifications.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot or book a 20‑minute demo. Transitional: Download the
    coordination checklist and sample policy language.
  success: >-
    Fewer no‑shows, less rescheduling, hours saved weekly, better compliance and
    documentation, youth arrive prepared with transport/childcare handled,
    caregivers and staff feel supported.
  failure: >-
    Without it: missed or late appointments, staff burnout, youth lose services,
    compliance risks and strained relationships, wasted time and funds on
    no‑shows.
