  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned roll/groove changeovers cause 30–90 minutes of hot-line
      downtime, costing $20k–$80k per hour and disrupting delivery schedules.
    - >-
      Conservative, fixed tonnage limits leave 10–25% of groove life unused,
      increasing roll costs and changeover frequency.
    - >-
      Data to manage groove life is siloed (PLC, historian, roll shop
      spreadsheets, operator logs) with no groove-level genealogy or automated
      reconciliation.
    - >-
      Thermal cycling (start/stop, grade changes, cooling water anomalies)
      accelerates wear unpredictably; mills lack continuous proxies to quantify
      these effects.
    - >-
      Mismatch between roll shop availability and production plan (grades,
      sizes, campaigns) leads to late or early changeovers and quality risk.
    - >-
      Surface defects and ovality drift from worn grooves are often detected
      post-process, causing rework, scrap, or customer claims.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into wear rate drivers (speed, lube/cooling flow, motor
      torque, separating force) prevents continuous optimization.
    - >-
      Excessive spare roll inventory is held to hedge uncertainty, tying up
      capital and shop capacity.
    - >-
      Existing tools (tonnage counters, spreadsheets, generic analytics) don’t
      deliver reliable, actionable groove life predictions or schedule
      recommendations.
    - >-
      OEM/automation vendor lock-in and custom projects are costly and slow;
      mills need vendor-agnostic solutions that integrate with existing systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge and historian connectors (OPC UA, Modbus/TCP, MQTT, PI/AVEVA,
      Proficy) capture tonnage by pass, speed, motor torque/power, separating
      force, cooling flows, and pyrometer data.
    - >-
      Roll/groove genealogy engine links roll IDs, groove IDs, stand/pass,
      regrinds, dates, shift logs, and quality results to every billet/heat
      processed.
    - >-
      Feature engineering of wear proxies: cumulative tonnage by groove, thermal
      cycles (time above temp thresholds), torque/RSF deviations, water/lube
      anomalies, speed/grade effects, cobble events.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML (survival analysis + gradient boosting) predicts
      remaining useful life (RUL) in tons/time for each groove and classifies
      high-risk grooves for the next shift/campaign.
    - >-
      Scheduler optimizer recommends the best changeover window aligned to the
      production plan (grades, sizes, orders), roll shop capacity, and quality
      risk tolerance; publishes to MES/EAM (SAP PM, Maximo).
    - >-
      Root-cause analytics compares expected vs observed wear rates to flag
      drivers (e.g., cooling imbalance, misalignment, speed changes) and
      quantifies their impact.
    - >-
      Operator- and roll shop–focused interfaces: groove health dashboard,
      shift-ahead alerts, what-if simulations (campaign changes), and mobile
      notifications (Teams/SMS).
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem or hybrid cloud with offline buffering,
      role-based access, and full audit trail.
    - >-
      90-day paid pilot playbook with success criteria (downtime avoided,
      prediction accuracy, tonnage uplift) and ROI validation; scales to
      multi-line enterprise rollout.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

  character: >-
    Mill and operations leaders in rolled steel shape plants who need
    predictable groove life, maximized uptime, and safe, on-time changeovers.
  problem: >-
    External: roll/groove wear is invisible until it isn’t—causing scrap,
    downtime, and risk. Internal: teams feel blind and reactive. Philosophical:
    in a data-rich mill, you shouldn’t have to guess when to change grooves.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of surprise roll failures. Our AI blends tonnage,
    thermal cycles, and wear proxies with metallurgy-informed models; integrates
    with PLC/MES; and keeps your data private and yours.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect counters/sensors (tonnage, temperatures, passes) or import run
    history. 2) Calibrate on your products and roll sets. 3) Predict groove life
    and optimal changeover windows by stand/pass. 4) Alert and schedule to
    minimize disruption. 5) Review after each campaign to continuously improve.

    download a sample groove-life report and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Predictable groove life, fewer emergency changeovers, higher throughput,
    lower scrap and roll costs, safer crews, and delivery dates you can keep.
  failure: >-
    Keep firefighting: sudden groove failures, lost tons per hour, overtime and
    missed shipments, safety exposure, and budget surprises.
