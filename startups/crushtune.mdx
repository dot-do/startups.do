  problem:
    - >-
      Unstable crusher operation (under/over-choking) causes frequent blockages,
      reduced throughput, and liner damage; most sites lack continuous detection
      and early warning.
    - >-
      Screen blinding and pegging go unnoticed until product gradation drifts
      out of spec, driving rework/recirculation and lost saleable tons.
    - >-
      Manual tuning is tribal-knowledge-based and risky; operators hesitate to
      adjust CSS, feed rate, screen angle/speed, or water sprays without
      guidance, prolonging suboptimal operation.
    - >-
      SCADA/historian data (motor currents, power, pressures, vib, cavity level)
      is underused; sites have alarms but not prescriptive, quarry-specific
      advice.
    - >-
      Unplanned stoppages for clearing chokes and blinding lead to 1–3%
      availability loss and safety interventions that increase MSHA recordable
      risk.
    - >-
      Energy intensity is 5–15% higher than necessary due to poor choke control
      and screen loading; no closed-loop feedback to optimize kWh/ton.
    - >-
      Corporate ops lack standardized KPIs across sites; hard to benchmark
      stability, blinding time, and operator adherence to best practices.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge+cloud AI analyzes live tags (crusher motor power/current, hydraulic
      pressure, cavity level if available, CSS, screen motor load,
      accelerometer/vibration, bearing temp, feed tonnage, water flow) to detect
      under/over-choke, screen blinding/pegging, and instability.
    - >-
      Prescriptive Advisor suggests operator-reviewed adjustments: feed rate
      changes, CSS tweaks, screen speed/angle, spray rates, split/recirc ratios,
      chute gate positions—bounded by safe, OEM-informed limits.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML: combines first-principles models of
      crushing/screening with data-driven models to estimate product size
      distribution and stability index in real time.
    - >-
      Operator workflow: HMI overlay shows stability scores, risk of choke,
      blinding likelihood, and recommended setpoint bands; one-tap ACK with
      reason codes enables auditability.
    - >-
      Daily/shift reports benchmark KPIs (throughput, kWh/ton, blinding minutes,
      chokes/1,000 hours, recirc %, spec compliance) and quantify savings vs
      baseline.
    - >-
      Integration kits/connectors for AVEVA PI System, Ignition, Rockwell
      FactoryTalk, and historians; secure OPC UA/MQTT edge agent with
      store-and-forward.
    - >-
      What-if simulator and A/B tuning playbooks to test small setpoint nudges
      safely before full adoption.
    - >-
      Data quality monitor flags bad sensors, drift, and signal latency to avoid
      misleading advice.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Unlock 3–8% more saleable tons and 5–15% lower kWh/ton by turning existing
    SCADA/historian data into real-time, safe, prescriptive tuning for crushers
    and screens—cut chokes and blinding by 20–40% and standardize best-practice
    operation across sites with payback in under 12 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary, cross-OEM dataset of labeled choke/blinding events
    paired with physics-informed models and OEM-vetted safe operating
    envelopes—embedded via low-latency edge agents integrated directly into
    quarry HMIs—plus reference deployments and co-selling agreements with major
