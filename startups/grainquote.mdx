  problem:
    - >-
      Manual quoting from drawings/emails takes 1–3 hours per RFQ and often 1–3
      days to return a price, causing missed deadlines and lost bids.
    - >-
      Input formats are messy (scanned PDFs, hand sketches, phone photos,
      DXF/DWG) leading to errors, rework, and margin leakage from missing specs
      (finish type, tolerances, grain direction, edge banding).
    - >-
      BOM and routing creation is manual; process steps (ripping, planing, CNC
      routing, moulding, sanding, finishing, assembly, packaging) are
      inconsistently captured, hurting repeatability and costing.
    - >-
      Lead times are guessed without a capacity-aware schedule, creating
      overpromising, late deliveries, and credibility loss with customers.
    - >-
      Small/mid-sized shops (10–200 employees) rely on spreadsheets/QuickBooks
      with little integration to CAD/CAM/ERP, making quoting a bottleneck and
      single-point-of-failure risk (1–2 estimators).
    - >-
      Price inconsistency across estimators results in +/-15–25% variance for
      identical parts/jobs, reducing win rate and/or margins.
    - >-
      Sales teams lack visibility into quote status, hit rates, and
      profitability by customer/part family, limiting continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-modal ingestion: parse PDFs, photos, and CAD (DXF/DWG, SketchUp,
      STEP exports) to extract dimensions, material, grain direction, edge
      treatments, finish, tolerances.
    - >-
      Automated BOM builder: maps parts to material families (hardwood,
      softwood, plywood/MDF, laminates), sheet/board optimization parameters,
      hardware, adhesives, packaging.
    - >-
      Routing estimator: generates operations (rip, plane, CNC route, mould,
      drill, sand, spray finish, assemble, pack) with cycle times based on
      geometry, material, machine libraries, and shop-calibrated speeds/feeds.
    - >-
      Pricing rules engine: roll-up COGS (material yield, labor, machine burden,
      overhead) and apply markups, customer-specific pricing tiers, and
      minimums; flags low-margin quotes for review.
    - >-
      Capacity-aware lead times: finite-capacity model by workcenter; uses
      current backlog/import from ERP to give realistic promise dates and
      expedite options.
    - >-
      Email-to-quote: monitor RFQ inboxes; auto-draft quotes and route
      exceptions to human-in-the-loop; log all assumptions.
    - >-
      Integrations: QuickBooks, JobBOSS2/E2, Odoo, Cabinet Vision/Microvellum
      exports, CSV; push BOM/routing to ERP on win.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: fast UI to confirm extracted specs and costs;
      learn from corrections to improve accuracy per shop.
    - >-
      Analytics: quote cycle time, win-rate uplift, margin by customer/part
      family, hit/miss reasons, estimator throughput.
    - >-
      Compliance & security: SOC 2 roadmap; SSO, audit logs, PII/ITAR-like
      controls for sensitive OEM prints (private deployment option).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From file to price in minutes: Turn PDFs/photos/CAD and email specs into a
    clean BOM, routing, and priced quote with a capacity-based lead time. Cut
    quote time by 70%, standardize pricing, and hit +/-10% cost accuracy on 90%
    of quotes after 8 weeks of calibration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A calibrated, wood-specific quoting brain: a proprietary dataset and machine
    parameter library for common woodworking equipment, paired with ERP/CAD
    integrations and human-in-the-loop workflows that continuously learn per
    shop. This yields faster, more accurate quotes than general-purpose AI or
    spreadsheet-based systems, and switching costs increase as rules and
    calibrations compound.
