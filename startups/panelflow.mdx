  problem:
    - >-
      Storyboards and animatics for commercials/film/TV are slow and expensive
      (typical turnaround 2–5 days; $1,500–$10,000 per project).
    - >-
      Maintaining visual and character consistency across panels with current
      image models is unreliable, causing rework (30–50% of panels revised).
    - >-
      Converting scripts/shot lists into timed animatics with temp VO/music is
      manual and error‑prone (2–8 hours per minute of animatic).
    - >-
      Version control and collaboration across directors, producers, and clients
      are fragmented (email/PDFs), delaying approvals by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Existing AI image/video tools are not designed for production workflows
      (no shot numbering, lens metadata, EDL/XML export, or legal/compliance
      features).
    - >-
      Security/compliance concerns (unlicensed training data, lack of on‑prem
      options) block enterprise adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Import a script (Final Draft/Fountain/PDF) or shot list (CSV); automatic
      scene/beat detection creates an initial panel plan with durations.
    - >-
      Generate style-locked, character-consistent panels per shot using
      controllable models (pose, camera, lens, aspect) and studio-safe styles.
    - >-
      Auto-construct an animatic: align dialogue with TTS voiceover, set timings
      to beats, and add temp licensed stock music.
    - >-
      Provide a collaborative review workspace with notes, versions, and
      side-by-side diffs; one-click export to PDF, MP4, and NLE timelines
      (XML/AAF/EDL).
    - >-
      Enterprise options: private/air‑gapped deployment, data governance, and
      custom fine-tunes (characters/sets/brand).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From script or shot list to style-consistent storyboards and a timed
    animatic (with temp VO/music) in under an hour—export-ready for
    Premiere/After Effects/Resolve—cutting previsualization time and cost by
    60–80% while improving consistency and approval speed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A production-grade, style-safe storyboard pipeline with proven character
    consistency and camera grammar, integrated exports to professional NLEs, and
    enterprise deployment/compliance—validated by case studies quantifying
    60–80% time savings. Proprietary style packs and reproducible seeds deliver
    outputs clients can trust and revise, not just “cool” AI images.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Producers, directors, and creative leads who must visualize scripts fast to
    align teams, win greenlights, and plan shoots with confidence.
  problem: >-
    Traditional boards and animatics are slow, costly, and inconsistent—leading
    to misaligned expectations, blown timelines, and uncertain budgets. They
    need a reliable way to turn words into timed visuals without bottlenecks.
  guide: >-
    We understand pre-production pressure and the risk of pitching or scheduling
    without clear visuals. Our AI turns your script or shot list into
    style-consistent storyboards and a timed animatic with temp VO and music.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload your script/shot list and style refs (or choose a preset). 2)
    Receive auto-generated boards and a timed animatic. 3) Review, iterate, and
    export (PDF, MP4, EDL/AAF) for pitch, edit, or set.
  callToAction: Book a demo or upload a script to generate a free sample sequence today.
  success: >-
    Lock timing early, align stakeholders, cut revisions and costs, win
    approvals faster, and start production with a shared visual plan.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing in meetings, miss pitch windows, overrun budgets, and risk
    reshoots because the team never saw the same story.
