leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Scenario design is slow and manual: creating coherent macro-financial
      stress paths across GDP, inflation, unemployment, house prices, funding
      spreads, and sectoral credit often takes 6–12 weeks and multiple review
      cycles.
    - >-
      Cross-variable inconsistencies: submitted bank projections frequently
      violate macro-identity constraints (e.g., NII vs yield curve moves; credit
      losses vs unemployment/PD paths).
    - >-
      High rework in submissions: 15–30% of banks require resubmission due to
      mapping errors, missing fields, and outliers not flagged early;
      supervisors spend 60–70% of time on data QA instead of analysis.
    - >-
      Limited explainability and auditability of models: AI/ML usage often fails
      SR 11-7/ECB expectations for model governance, documentation, and
      repeatability.
    - >-
      Fragmented data pipelines: multiple formats (XBRL, CSV, SDMX), versions,
      and taxonomies drive long integration times and brittle processes.
    - >-
      Resource constraints at authorities: small teams must supervise many
      institutions and scenarios; peak workload during stress-testing windows
      causes bottlenecks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Scenario Authoring Copilot: natural-language prompts to propose
      macro-financial paths; constraint engine enforces accounting identities
      and macro-financial linkages (e.g., Okun’s Law, Phillips curve variants,
      credit-to-GDP gap).
    - >-
      Model Library: DSGE, BVAR, and satellite loss/PD/LGD models with
      jurisdictional calibrations; supports climate and liquidity add-ons.
    - >-
      Plausibility & Coherence Scoring: quantitative checks on paths (historical
      percentiles, cross-series coherence, regime shifts) with explainable
      diagnostics.
    - >-
      Submission QC Engine: schema-aware validation for XBRL/CSV; anomaly
      detection (robust z-scores, isolation forests, SHAP-based explanations);
      rule packs for common errors by reporting template.
    - >-
      Cross-Bank Benchmarking: privacy-preserving aggregation to identify cohort
      outliers versus peers and past cycles.
    - >-
      Governance by Design: full audit trails, versioning, lineage, model cards,
      SR 11-7-aligned documentation, approval workflows, and immutable logs.
    - >-
      Secure Deployment Options: on-prem, sovereign cloud, or air-gapped;
      role-based access, row/column-level security; CMK/HSM; FedRAMP/IRAP/ISO
      27001-ready controls.
    - >-
      Integrations: connectors to supervisory data lakes, AxiomSL/Adenza,
      OneSumX, SAS, SDMX, and BI tools; export to standard templates.
    - >-
      What-if & Sensitivity: shock builder for user-defined overlays (e.g., 300
      bps rate shock) with immediate propagation to bank projections.
    - >-
      Collaboration Workspace: red-teaming, comments, and tasking across macro,
      supervisory, and statistics departments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One secure platform to author credible, constraint-consistent
    macro-financial stress scenarios and automatically QC supervised-institution
    submissions with explainable AI and regulator-grade audit trails—cutting
    scenario-design lead time by 50% and QC time by 70%, while improving
    consistency and defensibility.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary cross-jurisdiction library of labeled submission anomalies and
    validation rules, combined with a constraint-aware scenario engine and
    built-in SR 11-7/ECB-aligned governance. Pre-integration with major
    regulatory reporting stacks and readiness for sovereign cloud/air-gapped
    deployments shortens procurement and time-to-value.

  character: >-
    Supervisory stress‑testing and macroprudential teams at central banks who
    want policy‑consistent scenarios and clean, comparable bank submissions—on
    time and audit‑ready.
  problem: >-
    - External: Inconsistent bank templates and assumptions; manual QC
    bottlenecks; late and noisy submissions; evolving risk channels (rates,
    liquidity, CRE, climate, cyber) stretching scenario coverage.

    - Internal: Fear of missing systemic vulnerabilities; low confidence in
    aggregates; fatigue from back‑and‑forth resubmissions.

    - Philosophical: The public deserves supervision that is rigorous,
    explainable, and fair.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the scrutiny and the need for transparent,
    defensible decisions.

    - Authority: Designed with input from former central bank quants and
    supervisors; governance‑ready with explainability, lineage, and full audit
    trails; deployable within sovereign data boundaries.
  plan: |-
    - Process:
      1) Configure: Ingest your taxonomies/templates; set scenario policy constraints; define QC rules and materiality thresholds.
      2) Generate: Create macro‑financial scenarios, shocks, and paths; calibrate to history and forward views; document rationale.
      3) Validate: Run automated submission QC (identities, tie‑outs, elasticities, peer/time‑series outliers, unit/sign checks); iterate; finalize dashboards and aggregates.
    - Agreement:
      - Start with a time‑boxed pilot and clear success criteria.
      - Deploy on‑prem or sovereign cloud; no cross‑jurisdiction data sharing.
      - You retain ownership of data, models, and scenario artifacts.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Schedule a pilot scoped to your next stress test cycle.
    - Transitional: Request the sample scenario library and QC rulebook.
  success: >-
    - Coherent, policy‑aligned scenarios that withstand internal and public
    scrutiny.

    - Faster cycles with fewer resubmissions and cleaner cross‑bank aggregates.

    - Early detection of inconsistencies and outliers; clear explanations for
    supervisory decisions.

    - Repeatable, version‑controlled processes and evidence ready for audit and
    legislature.
  failure: |-
    - Missed vulnerabilities and inconsistent supervisory messages.
    - Late publications, credibility risk, and avoidable remediation costs.
    - Strained bank‑supervisor relationships due to preventable rework.
