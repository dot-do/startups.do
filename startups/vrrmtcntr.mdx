  problem:
    - >-
      Manual sticky-board counting is slow (10–20 minutes per board),
      error-prone, and inconsistent across staff, delaying time-critical
      treatment decisions.
    - >-
      Commercial operations with thousands of hives lack scalable, standardized
      mite-monitoring workflows and audit-ready logs for buyers, inspectors, and
      certifications (organic/IPM).
    - >-
      Existing digital tools don’t translate counts into clear, region- and
      season-aware treatment guidance; guidance is scattered across sources and
      not tied to the actual count window/exposure time.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability requirements (e.g., treatment logs,
      thresholds, product rotations) are growing, but beekeepers lack an easy,
      centralized record tied to objective evidence (images + counts).
    - >-
      Labor shortages in peak season make it hard to maintain recommended
      monitoring frequency (e.g., every 2–4 weeks), leading to late detection
      and losses.
  solution:
    - >-
      Smartphone capture workflow with calibration frame to standardize scale,
      lighting, and exposure time.
    - >-
      On-device or cloud computer-vision that detects and counts mites,
      normalizes per 24/48/72-hour exposure, and estimates infestation pressure.
    - >-
      Context-aware decision support that maps counts to threshold bands and
      suggests next steps aligned with IPM best practices (non-prescriptive).
    - >-
      Automated compliance logs with images, timestamps, GPS/apiary IDs, and
      treatment record templates; exportable for audits and certifications.
    - >-
      Team features for commercial crews: batch scanning, role-based access, and
      integrations with apiary management software.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Fast, accurate mite counts from a phone photo of your sticky board—plus
    evidence-backed treatment guidance and audit-ready logs—so you can treat on
    time, prove compliance, and protect your bees at scale.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, field-validated dataset of sticky-board images tied to
    calibrated capture hardware, plus institutional partnerships
    (extension/inspectors) that create trust, distribution, and switching
    costs—combined with audit-grade logs that competitors lack.
