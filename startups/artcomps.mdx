  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers and advisors spend 2–6 hours per work manually gathering and
      normalizing comps across auction/private sources, leading to slow quoting
      and missed sales windows.
    - >-
      Existing databases (e.g., Artnet, Artprice) surface raw comps but lack
      explainable, case-specific adjustments (size, medium, condition,
      provenance), forcing error-prone spreadsheets.
    - >-
      Private sale comps are fragmented and not standardized, making pricing
      inconsistent and difficult to justify to consignors/collectors.
    - >-
      Lenders/insurers require defendable, auditable rationale; most tools lack
      transparency and backtested accuracy metrics.
    - >-
      Market volatility (seasonality, guarantees, artist hype cycles) is not
      baked into most estimates, increasing risk for dealers trading inventory.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven comparable selection blending auction results with normalized
      private sale data.
    - >-
      Explainable adjustments (size, medium, date, condition, provenance,
      exhibition/publication history, signature, guarantee status, time-decay)
      with factor-level contributions per estimate.
    - >-
      Confidence-scored valuation bands (low/likely/high) with rationale,
      backtests, and expected sell-through probability.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations (Artlogic, ArtBinder, Artsy, Salesforce) to pull
      inventory data and push valuations to deal pipelines.
    - >-
      API for lenders/insurers to embed indicative fair value ranges and audit
      trails in underwriting systems.
    - >-
      Privacy-preserving “data co-op” for dealers to contribute anonymized
      private comps in exchange for discounts and better coverage.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate explainable valuation ranges in minutes, not hours—using auction
    and private comps with transparent, audit-ready adjustments. Faster quotes,
    tighter consignments, and defendable pricing that wins deals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Privacy-preserving private-comp data co-op plus explainable, audited
    adjustments tuned for art dealer workflows. Backtested accuracy with
    independent verification and native integrations into the tools dealers
    already use creates switching costs and trust.
