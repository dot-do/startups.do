  title: Auction Comps & Price Guidance
  description: >-
    Produce size/medium-adjusted comps and a justified asking-range with charts
    and rationale.
  targetUsers:
    - Dealers
    - Advisors
    - Galleries
  triggers:
    - New inventory pricing
    - Repricing before fair or auction consignment
  inputs:
    - Artist name
    - 'Medium, size, date'
    - Condition notes
    - 'Target market segment (primary/secondary, region)'
  steps:
    - Ingest auction results via user export/API and filter for comparable works
    - 'Normalize for size, medium, date, buyer’s premium, currency, inflation'
    - Adjust for condition/provenance modifiers via rules
    - Fit simple hedonic model/regression; produce range and confidence
    - Select top 8–12 comps with thumbnails and notes
    - Generate a one-page guidance brief and underlying dataset
  tools:
    - Python/Pandas/Statsmodels
    - 'CPI/FX APIs (e.g., FRED, ECB)'
    - Artnet/Artprice/MutualArt (via user account)
    - OpenAI for narrative rationale
    - Google Sheets/Data Studio for charts
  outputs:
    - 'Price guidance PDF (range, confidence, rationale)'
    - Comps table CSV with filters
    - Charts (PNG)
  pricingModel:
    - $120–$350 per report
    - 'Monthly monitoring add-on: $150–$500/mo per artist'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4
  risks:
    - Data licensing and terms of use
    - Model overfitting/false precision on thin markets
    - Condition/provenance adjustments are heuristic
  dependencies:
    - User exports/API access from data providers
    - FX/inflation data access

  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers and galleries spend 2–6 hours per pricing decision manually
      pulling comps across multiple databases, then normalizing by size/medium
      with ad‑hoc heuristics.
    - >-
      Mispricing risk is high: overpricing stalls inventory and damages
      relationships; underpricing leaves margin on the table. Many SMB dealers
      lack quantitative tools to justify asks to consignors/collectors.
    - >-
      Comps sources are fragmented, expensive, and not standardized (varying
      buyer’s premiums, condition disclosures, withdrawn lots). Adjustments for
      size, medium, date, edition, and signature are rarely systematic.
    - >-
      Staff turnover and institutional memory loss cause inconsistent pricing
      across artists and over time.
    - >-
      Dealers need shareable, credible “proof packs” (charts + rationale) for
      negotiations, but producing them is time‑consuming and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Monitoring new auctions for relevant comps is manual; missed comps lead to
      outdated asks and lost deals.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified comps engine that aggregates and cleans auction results,
      normalizes fees, and deduplicates lots; then applies artist- and
      medium-specific hedonic models to produce size/medium/date-adjusted
      comparables.
    - >-
      Explainable AI price guidance: recommended asking range (P5–P95) with an
      80% confidence band, mid-point rationale, and comparability scoring per
      comp.
    - >-
      One-click PDF/URL “proof pack” with charts (price vs. size, time series,
      $/sq.in. distributions), adjustment breakdowns, and narrative rationale.
    - >-
      Artist-specific market signals: trendlines, liquidity/velocity metrics,
      unsold rate, seasonality, and upcoming auction alerts.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: Artlogic, ArtBinder, and Artsy inventory import;
      Chrome extension to price from any artwork page; API for enterprise.
    - >-
      Quality guardrails: condition proxies (via image quality cues),
      signature/certificate flags, and edition size adjustments;
      human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence cases.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate defensible, size/medium-adjusted auction comps and a justified
    asking range in under 3 minutes—with explainable adjustments, confidence
    scores, and negotiation-ready charts integrated into gallery workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cleaned, and artist-normalized comps dataset combined with
    explainable, backtested hedonic models embedded directly in gallery
    workflows—and a developing network of anonymized private-sale datapoints
    contributed by customers (opt-in, privacy-preserving) that competitors
    cannot easily replicate.

  problem: >-
    External: Auction/private-sale data is scattered and inconsistent; adjusting
    for size, medium, date, and condition is slow and subjective. Internal:
    Uncertainty makes pitches risky and negotiations tense. Philosophical:
    Pricing fine art shouldn’t be guesswork.

    works across major houses and marketplaces. We know the pressure to defend a
    number. Our AI normalizes comps by size/medium and delivers transparent
    charts and rationale.

  success: >-
    Win more consignments, price with confidence, defend margins, shorten sales
    cycles, and strengthen credibility with transparent, data-backed guidance.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing, misprice works, lose consignments to competitors, invite
    haggling, erode margins, and risk reputational damage when numbers can’t be
    defended.
