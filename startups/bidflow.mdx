leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as multi-document packages (PDF/DWG/Excel/Word) with
      inconsistent structure; extracting 150–500+ data points per RFQ is manual
      and error-prone.
    - >-
      Proposal cycle time (from RFQ receipt to compliant technical + commercial
      response) averages 2–7 days, causing missed deadlines and reduced
      submission volume.
    - >-
      Compliance matrices to API/ASME/Customer Specs are assembled manually;
      gaps drive rework, exceptions, and downstream non-compliance risk.
    - >-
      Pricing drafts and BOMs often drift from catalog rules and cost models,
      creating margin leakage (1–3% average).
    - >-
      Version control across proposals, clarifications, and deviations is
      fragmented (email/SharePoint), increasing audit risk and internal
      friction.
    - >-
      Experienced applications engineers are a bottleneck; tribal knowledge
      isn’t captured, increasing onboarding time and quality variance.
    - >-
      Duplicate/near-duplicate RFQs are not identified; teams rework similar
      packages, lowering throughput by 10–20%.
    - >-
      CRM/ERP/CPQ and engineering tools (sizing/selectors) are poorly integrated
      into the proposal workflow, causing double entry and data loss.
    - >-
      Short bid windows from EPCs/NOCs (24–72 hours) require faster, more
      accurate first-pass drafts to qualify and prioritize RFQs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQ packages from email, portals, or CRM; auto-split, OCR, and
      classify documents (datasheets, standards, SoW, T&Cs, drawings).
    - >-
      Extract structured specs with a domain ontology (flow, head/pressure,
      NPSH, materials, seal plans, motor ratings, testing, documentation
      deliverables).
    - >-
      Auto-generate a compliance matrix against API/ASME/customer specs,
      highlighting conform/non-conform items with justification and suggested
      exceptions/clarifications.
    - >-
      Draft BOM and pricing from catalog rules and cost models; integrate with
      CPQ/ERP for final pricing and approvals.
    - >-
      Assemble proposal documents (technical narrative, datasheets, compliance
      matrix, exceptions/deviations, schedule, QA/QC) in customer-specific
      templates (Word/Excel/PDF).
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop review; learn from edits to
      improve future extractions and rule application.
    - >-
      Integrate with CRM (Salesforce, Dynamics), CPQ (SAP, Oracle, SFDC CPQ),
      PLM/ERP (SAP, Oracle, Infor), and engineering sizing/selection tools.
    - >-
      Analytics: cycle-time, proposal throughput, spec coverage, win-rate
      uplift, margin leakage flags; duplicate RFQ detection and prioritization.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Submit fully assembled, standards-aligned proposals 2–3x faster with 95%+
    spec coverage and catalog-correct pricing drafts—so you can bid more, win
    more, and protect margin.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific extraction and rule engine pre-trained on oil & gas
    pump/pressure control specs; a growing library of API/EPC-aligned compliance
    mappings and exceptions; and deep connectors to CPQ/ERP/PLM that preserve
    catalog and margin rules—creating switching costs and continuous learning
    advantages.

    catalog constraints. Authority: Our AI is tuned to oilfield machinery data
    models and proposal workflows to produce compliant, review-ready outputs
    your SMEs can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload RFQ package and catalog/pricing rules. 2) AI extracts specs, maps
    to BOM/options, and drafts technical proposal, compliance matrix, and
    pricing per rules. 3) Engineer reviews, finalizes, and exports to your
    template, CPQ, or ERP.
  callToAction: Request a 30-minute demo or start a 2-week pilot on your next 5 RFQs.
  success: >-
    Proposals in hours, not weeks; consistent compliance; audit-ready
    traceability; fewer clarifications; protected margins; higher win rate;
    happier teams.
  failure: >-
