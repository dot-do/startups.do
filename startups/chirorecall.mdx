  problem:
    - >-
      High patient lapse and unfinished care plans: 20–40% of new chiropractic
      patients stop care within 90 days; unfinished care plans leave
      $5,000–$20,000/month in unrealized revenue per clinic.
    - >-
      Manual, inconsistent follow-up: Front desk teams lack time to run
      reactivation lists; follow-up is sporadic and rarely personalized,
      resulting in low conversion.
    - >-
      Compliance risk and carrier filtering: TCPA/CASL/HIPAA constraints and A2P
      10DLC rules make clinics hesitant to text; improper outreach leads to
      blocked messages, complaints, and fines.
    - >-
      EHR data silos: Most clinics can’t segment by care-plan status, last visit
      date, diagnosis, or insurance authorization; generic blasts lead to poor
      results and opt-outs.
    - >-
      No ROI visibility: Clinics lack clear attribution from outreach to booked
      visits and collected revenue, making it hard to justify marketing spend.
    - >-
      Capacity management: Clinics fear overbooking; lack of schedule-aware
      outreach causes poor patient experience or idle gaps.
    - >-
      Rising acquisition costs: New patient marketing costs $150–$350 per
      patient; reactivation is cheaper but underutilized due to tooling and
      process gaps.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven identification: Bi-directional EHR sync to flag inactive
      (e.g., no visit in 60–180 days), unfinished care plans (visits remaining
      or expiring insurance auth), and at-risk patients (missed 2+ visits).
    - >-
      Consent and compliance engine: TCPA/CASL consent capture, opt-in auditing,
      quiet hours, DNC scrubbing, 10DLC registration/brand vetting, HIPAA BAA,
      content risk scoring, and easy opt-out handling.
    - >-
      AI-personalized outreach: Multi-channel sequences (SMS, email, voicemail
      drops) tailored by last visit, care-plan status, provider, condition, and
      benefits expiring; multilingual with human tone.
    - >-
      Conversational SMS agent: Handles replies 24/7 (rescheduling, FAQs,
      insurance/benefits questions), escalates to staff when needed, and books
      directly to the clinic’s calendar.
    - >-
      Schedule-aware automation: Pulls provider availability to pace outreach
      and avoid overbooking; fills short-notice cancellations and low-capacity
      hours first.
    - >-
      Attribution and ROI analytics: Tracks booked appointments, show rates,
      collections, revenue per reactivated patient, and time-to-ROI; exports to
      spreadsheets and dashboards.
    - >-
      A/B testing and optimization: Test scripts, send times, offer types (e.g.,
      progress check, re-exam, benefit reminder); auto-shift budget to best
      performers.
    - >-
      Fast onboarding: Integration in 3–7 days with historical data import,
      consent audit, and a 30-day pilot including baseline report and target
      KPIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn dormant chiropractic patients into booked visits—automatically and
    compliantly. Achieve 3–8% monthly reactivation of inactive or unfinished
    care-plan patients with AI-personalized, HIPAA/TCPA-compliant outreach and
    clear ROI attribution.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Care-plan-aware recall built specifically for chiropractic with deep EHR
    mappings, a compliance-first engine (HIPAA/TCPA/A2P) vetted by counsel, and
    AI models fine-tuned on chiropractic workflows. Early integrations and
    proven ROI case studies create switching costs and partner moat;
    performance-based pricing and a 30-day guarantee reduce buyer risk.
