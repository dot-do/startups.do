leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Variant annotation and triage for research takes 3–12 hours per sample
      across dispersed tools, slowing discovery timelines.
    - >-
      Inconsistent, non-reproducible prioritization criteria across teams leads
      to variable results and rework.
    - >-
      Evidence is fragmented across dozens of databases and literature; manual
      evidence gathering is error-prone and not versioned.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either too clinical, too rigid, or too open-ended for
      at-scale research workflows.
    - >-
      Scaling variant review to thousands of samples per month stresses
      bioinformatics teams; compute and curation costs rise nonlinearly.
    - >-
      Research programs need explainable, auditable scoring to support decisions
      and publications, without clinical claims.
    - >-
      Integration friction with LIMS/ELN/pipelines (VCF in, ranked variant lists
      out, provenance tracking) adds overhead.
    - >-
      Data license complexity (e.g., HGMD, OMIM) and update cadences cause
      compliance risk and stale results.
    - >-
      Cross-project comparability is poor; changes in annotation sources/models
      cause silent drift without version pinning.
    - >-
      Security/procurement requirements (SOC 2, on‑prem options) block adoption
      of many SaaS-only offerings in biopharma.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified service that ingests VCF/BCF and returns ranked variants with
      linked evidence, rule-based scores, and explanations.
    - >-
      Explainable AI models (NLP + graph-based) to extract, normalize, and weigh
      functional, pathway, and literature evidence (RUO).
    - >-
      Configurable rule engine (ACMG-inspired, RUO-adapted) with project-level
      templates and user-defined criteria; version-controlled.
    - >-
      Knowledge graph that consolidates public and licensed sources (e.g.,
      ClinVar, gnomAD, COSMIC, Ensembl, CIViC, DisGeNET), updated weekly with
      provenance.
    - >-
      Batch mode for thousands of samples; API/CLI/SDK for automated
      integration; containerized workers for on-prem/VPC deployment.
    - >-
      Evidence audit trails: dataset versions, model versions, rulesets,
      timestamps; exportable for methods sections in publications.
    - >-
      Phenotype-aware prioritization using HPO and pathway context (RUO), with
      transparent weightings and user overrides.
    - >-
      Built-in benchmarking harness against curated truth sets; dashboards for
      precision/recall@K and reviewer agreement.
    - >-
      Enterprise controls: SSO/SCIM, RBAC, project-based data isolation; SOC
      2-ready processes; RUO labeling enforced in UI/API.
    - >-
      Cost-efficient compute orchestration (serverless + spot) to keep
      per-sample COGS <$0.35 for typical exome/panel workloads.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce variant triage time by 70–90% with explainable AI + rule-based
    scoring tailored for research use only (RUO), delivering reproducible,

    integration, and enterprise-grade deployment options.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, provenance-rich knowledge graph and explainable
    scoring stack trained via semi-automated curation and active learning with
    design partners, enabling faster, more reproducible research triage than

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Biotech R&D teams and computational biologists who need to quickly identify
    high‑impact genomic variants to guide experiments — research use only.
  problem: >-
    Exploding variant volumes, fragmented evidence, and inconsistent manual
    curation slow decisions and risk chasing low‑value leads — researchers
    should spend time on biology, not wrangling annotations.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit research milestones and the reality of
    noisy variant data; our AI‑driven, rule‑based pipelines unify annotations
    with traceable evidence, built by genomics and software veterans — for
    research use only, not for diagnostic procedures.
  plan: >-
    Upload VCF or connect via API → automated annotation, evidence linking, and
    rule‑based scoring → review prioritized variants, adjust rules, and export
    to LIMS or ELN.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct — start a RUO pilot on your data. Transitional — request a demo with
    a benchmarking snapshot and sample report.
  success: >-
    Consistent, auditable variant shortlists that focus experiments, accelerate
    iteration, and increase confidence in research decisions.
  failure: >-
    Without effective triage, teams drown in noisy variant lists, overlook
    promising signals, and waste time and budget on low‑priority assays.
