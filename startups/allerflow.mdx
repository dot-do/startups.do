  problem:
    - >-
      Planners spend 2–4 hours daily building schedules in Excel to balance due
      dates, allergens, and changeovers; last‑minute order changes cause
      firefighting, overtime, and missed shipments.
    - >-
      Allergen changeovers (e.g., nut/no‑nut, milk/dark, gluten/no‑gluten)
      require 1–6 hours of cleaning and verification per event; plants lose
      10–25% of available line time to changeovers and sanitation windows.
    - >-
      Cross‑contact risk rises when sequences are broken; allergen swab failures
      trigger re-cleans, scrap, and possible holds/recalls, damaging auditor
      scores (BRCGS/SQF) and customer trust.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/MES schedulers (or generic APS) don’t model
      confectionery‑specific constraints (enrobing/molding, cooling tunnels,
      tempering, viscosity/temperature families, shared utensils/molds,
      sanitation crew capacity).
    - >-
      Inventory and QA data sit in silos (ERP, WMS, LIMS); schedules don’t
      account for QA sample lead times, allergen verification steps, or
      sanitation crew availability.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and rush orders break the ‘ideal’ sequence; planners
      lack fast re-optimization tools, resulting in excess changeovers, expedite
      freight, and missed OTIF targets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to ERP/MES/WMS/LIMS to ingest orders, SKUs, attributes (allergens,
      chocolate type), routings, resources, QA tests, and inventory.
    - >-
      Allergen‑aware optimizer (MILP/CP‑SAT) that minimizes weighted changeovers
      and sanitation while meeting due dates, freshness/age rules, crew and
      equipment constraints.
    - >-
      Changeover matrix and allergen cascade logic (e.g., dark → milk → nut;
      gluten‑free before gluten) per line, with cleaning times by direction and
      verification steps.
    - >-
      Scenario planning and ‘what‑if’ (rush order, downtime, labor shortage)
      with side‑by‑side KPI impact (OTIF, changeover hours, overtime).
    - >-
      Integrated QA/sanitation scheduling: auto‑inserts swab windows, crew
      assignments, and dry/wet clean durations; produces cleaning checklists
      from sequence.
    - >-
      Real‑time rescheduling from shop‑floor events (downtime, late materials)
      with alerts for due‑date risk and allergen rule violations.
    - >-
      Audit trail and compliance reports (BRCGS/SQF/FSMA) showing sequence
      rationale, cleans performed, and verification evidence.
    - >-
      Low‑code rules editor for planners/FSQA to update allergen policies, new
      SKUs, and changeover times without IT.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit due dates with fewer cleans and lower allergen risk. AllerFlow sequences
    runs to ‘cascade’ allergens, minimize changeovers, and coordinate
    QA/sanitation—turning a 2‑hour manual schedule into a 10‑minute, audit‑ready
    plan.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized allergen‑aware scheduler with validated changeover matrices and
    compliance templates for confectionery, enabling 30‑day deployments and
    90‑day ROI; ecosystem ties with sanitation/QA vendors and auditors that
    generic APS tools lack.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid‑market confectionery manufacturers producing from purchased chocolate
      (2–8 lines, 100–1,000 SKUs, $30M–$500M revenue/site).

  character: >-
    Confectionery producers using purchased chocolate—production schedulers and
    plant leaders who must hit due dates while juggling limited lines, frequent
    recipe changeovers, and strict allergen constraints.
  problem: >-
    External: Complex order mix, allergen matrices, and line constraints create
    chaotic schedules and costly washdowns. Internal: Teams firefight and
    re-sequence by spreadsheet, fearing cross-contact and missed ship dates.
    Philosophical: You shouldn’t have to risk safety or margins to deliver on
    time.
  guide: >-
    We understand the daily pressure of due dates, allergens, and labor limits.
    Our team blends food manufacturing, quality, and AI optimization
    experience—proven to cut changeovers and washdowns, reduce allergen risk,
    and integrate with your ERP/MES.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your orders, BOMs, allergen matrix, runtimes, and constraints. 2)
    Generate an optimal daily/weekly run sequence that protects due dates while
    minimizing changeovers and allergen exposure; run what-ifs instantly. 3) Go
    live with alerts, KPI tracking, and scheduler override. Start with a 4-week
    pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute discovery to scope a 4-week pilot. Transitional:
    Download the ROI calculator and a sample optimized schedule.
  success: >-
    On-time delivery, 20–40% fewer changeovers/washdowns, lower allergen risk,
    higher line utilization, steadier shifts, less overtime, audit-ready
    documentation, and confident planners.
  failure: >-
    Without it: late orders, expensive washdowns, cross-contact exposure,
    overtime and idle capacity, stressed teams, audit findings, and lost
    customer trust.
