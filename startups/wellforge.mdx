leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Change impact is opaque: Engineering change requests/orders (ECR/ECO)
      often miss downstream effects on BOM variants, routings, tooling, supplier
      capacity, WIP, and open sales orders, leading to surprise costs and delays
    - >-
      Long cycle times: Typical ECO cycle time is 10–30 days for oilfield
      assemblies (valves, chokes, trees, BOP components), driven by manual
      analysis, email loops, and tribal knowledge
    - >-
      Cost overruns and expedite spend: Last-minute material expediting,
      overtime, and premium freight can add 5–10 percent to unit cost on
      affected orders; single WIP scrap events can exceed 100k USD
    - >-
      Compliance and risk: API 6A, 16A, 17D implications (materials, heat
      treatment, NDE, pressure testing) are often not evaluated early, creating
      requalification risk and late-stage test failures
    - >-
      Disconnected systems: PLM, ERP, MES, and QMS data are siloed; native
      PLM/ERP impact tools are rule-based and product-agnostic, lacking oilfield
      domain depth
    - >-
      Supplier volatility: Lead-time and capacity for forgings, CRA materials
      (Inconel 625/718), cladding, and coatings (HVOF) change rapidly; planners
      lack predictive guidance at change time
    - >-
      Knowledge attrition: Senior planners and manufacturing engineers retire or
      rotate; undocumented fixture, NC program, and routing knowledge is lost
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven impact engine links PLM change objects to ERP BOMs, routings,
      WIP, open orders, supplier data, and tooling libraries to produce a
      quantified, explainable impact brief in minutes
    - >-
      Scenario simulation for what-if changes (materials, dimensions, pressure
      rating, supplier swap) with predicted cost delta, lead-time shift,
      capacity constraints, and compliance flags
    - >-
      Domain ontology for oilfield assemblies (API specs, materials, processes,
      NDE, hydro testing) mapping design attributes to manufacturing and
      qualification steps
    - >-
      Recommendations: Alternative materials/suppliers, routing adjustments,
      fixture reuse, batch consolidation, and requalification requirements with
      cost and time tradeoffs
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: Push approved changes to PLM/ERP, notify planners
      and buyers, generate reschedule proposals for open orders, and create
      quality and test plan updates
    - >-
      Security-first deployment options (on-premise or customer VPC), full audit
      trails, and model explainability for regulated manufacturing
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instant, explainable ECO impact analysis embedded in PLM/ERP for oilfield
    equipment — predicting cost, lead-time, tooling, and open-order risk so
    teams approve the right changes faster, avoid scrap/expedite, and protect
    on-time delivery.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, oilfield-specific impact ontology and training corpus
    co-developed with OEM partners, plus certified PLM/ERP connectors that map
    ECOs to open orders, tooling, and compliance steps out of the box. This
    yields explainable predictions at ECO time that generic PLM/ERP tools and
    horizontal AI platforms cannot match.

  character: >-
    Ops, Engineering, and Supply Chain leaders at oil & gas equipment
    manufacturers (valves, chokes, trees, BOP components) who must approve
    design changes without derailing cost, lead time, or delivery.
  problem: >-
    - External: Design changes ripple through BOMs, routings, tooling,
    suppliers, and open orders; data is scattered across PLM/ERP.

    - Internal: Teams fear costly surprises, firefighting, and eroded trust when
    changes hit late.

    - Philosophical: Engineering changes shouldn’t blindside
    operations—decisions should be data-driven and predictable.
  guide: >-
    We understand how late-stage ECRs/ECOs can stall production and inflate
    costs. Our team brings deep PLM/ERP and O&G manufacturing experience; the
    service securely integrates with your systems and translates changes into
    clear operational impacts.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect read-only to your PLM/ERP and import item masters, BOMs,
    routings, open orders, and supplier/tooling data.

    - Step 2: Submit or select an ECR/ECO; the AI quantifies impact on BOM,
    cost, lead time, tooling, suppliers, WIP, and open orders.

    - Step 3: Review a ranked impact report with mitigation options; approve,
    defer, or iterate and sync actions back to PLM/ERP.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo to see an impact report on your product
    line. Transitional: Upload a redacted ECR for a free sample impact snapshot.
  success: |-
    - Approve changes with data, not guesswork.
    - Shorten ECR/ECO cycle time and protect on-time delivery.
    - Reduce expedites, rework, and inventory shocks.
    - Keep tooling and suppliers aligned with minimal disruption.
    - Maintain traceability and audit readiness across PLM/ERP.
  failure: |-
    - Surprise shortages, scrapped WIP, tooling delays, and cost overruns.
    - Missed ship dates, penalties, and lost customer trust.
    - Opaque decisions that stall continuous improvement and margin goals.
