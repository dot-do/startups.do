  problem:
    - >-
      Manual lot allocation and yarn blending decisions are slow (30–90 minutes
      per order), error-prone, and depend on a few experts
    - >-
      High leftover yarn (3–10% of inventory) ties up working capital, causes
      write-offs, and creates shade/quality mismatch risks
    - >-
      Existing ERPs/MES lack textile-specific blending/optimization;
      spreadsheets can’t handle combinatorial constraints (shade deltaE, count,
      strength, U%, BOM tolerances) at mill scale
    - >-
      Production disruptions from shade mismatch and out-of-spec fabric lead to
      rework, rush dyeing, delayed shipments, and customer penalties
    - >-
      Purchasing is decoupled from allocation insights, resulting in suboptimal
      buy plans and overstock of off-shade/odd lots
    - >-
      No systematic way to simulate scenarios (e.g., substitute lots, price
      changes, urgent orders) and quantify cost/leftover impact
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine that allocates yarn lots to orders and proposes
      compliant blends minimizing cost and leftovers under constraints (specs,
      tolerances, machine/creel limits)
    - >-
      Textile-specific constraints: shade deltaE targets, yarn count (Ne)
      tolerance, GSM targets via yarn-to-fabric mapping, strength/elongation/U%
      limits, blend composition windows, cone/lot minimums
    - >-
      Color science module integrating L*a*b* data from color labs
      (Datacolor/X-Rite) with dye-house correction rules and metamerism checks
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate urgent orders, lot substitutions, price
      changes, and MOQ impacts; produce cost/leftover deltas
    - >-
      Procurement guidance: auto-generate buy/swap recommendations to close gaps
      at least cost (with supplier ranking)
    - >-
      Integrations: ERP/MES (SAP, Infor, Datatex, D365), testing
      (Uster/Premier), inventory systems via API; CSV upload for quick start
    - >-
      User workflow: import orders/specs → auto-allocate → review suggested
      blends → lock plan → generate pick lists and knitting instructions
    - >-
      Governance: audit trails, traceability to lot/COA, versioned plans, and
      release gates for PPC/QA sign-off
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce yarn leftovers and material cost while meeting shade and quality
    specs—automate lot allocation and blending with an optimization engine tuned
    for knit mills, delivering 25–40% leftover reduction, 1.5–3.5% yarn cost
    savings, and 80–90% faster planning.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mill-calibrated optimization + color science models and connectors that
    deliver measurable savings in weeks, not months—backed by a growing dataset
    of lot-level performance and shade behavior across mills, enabling faster,
    more accurate allocations than generic ERP/APS tools or spreadsheets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production planners and plant managers at knit fabric mills who must
    allocate yarn lots, meet fabric specs, and control cost and waste.
  problem: >-
    External: Many lots with varying shade and QA, tight due dates, and changing
    orders make allocation and blending complex. Internal: Planners are stuck
    firefighting, second‑guessing blends, and worrying about leftovers and
    misses. Philosophical: Yarn allocation should be precise and profitable—not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the daily scramble to match lots, specs, and
    delivery. Authority: An industry‑trained optimizer with transparent
    constraints, QA‑aware blending, and ERP/QC integrations; audited
    recommendations and human‑in‑the‑loop controls.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect ERP/QC data (lots, tests, orders, specs). 2) Set
    business rules and constraints (shade bands, blend limits, cost priorities).
    3) Run the optimizer, review scenarios, approve and export allocations.
    Agreement plan: secure data handling; no changes to shop‑floor systems;
    start with a low‑risk pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a live‑data pilot. Transitional:
    Download the ROI worksheet and a sample optimization report.
  success: >-
    Allocate the right lots first time; meet GSM/handfeel/shade/QC specs; cut
    leftovers and material cost; boost on‑time delivery; reduce planner
    workload; gain traceability of blends and decisions; turn capacity faster.
  failure: >-
    Without it: guesswork allocations, spec failures and reknits, idle stock and
    emergency buys, late shipments, margin erosion, and planner burnout.

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual allocation eats hours and still leaves costly leftovers and partial
      cones.
    - >-
      Specs (GSM, shade, strength) are hard to hit when substituting or blending
      under pressure.
    - >-
      Inventory is fragmented across lots, dye batches, and reservations—true
      availability and cost are unclear.
    - 'Over/under-blending triggers re-dyeing, rework, and late deliveries.'
    - 'No quick way to test price, lead time, and quality trade-offs.'
    - >-
      ERP rules miss shop-floor realities like batch sizes, machine limits, and
      wastage allowances.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI maps yarn lots to orders while honoring specs, tolerances,
      reservations, and machine constraints.
    - >-
      Suggests the most economical blends that meet GSM, handfeel, shade (Delta
      E), strength, and shrinkage targets.
    - >-
