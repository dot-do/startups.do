  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ intake is fragmented across email, PDFs, spreadsheets, portals, and
      EDI, forcing quoting teams to re-key data and slowing response times by
      24–72 hours.
    - >-
      Line-item identification and normalization are error-prone (brand/MPN/SKU
      variants, UoM conversions, pack sizes), leading to incorrect quotes and
      backorders.
    - >-
      Mapping buyer requests to available catalog or alternates requires tribal
      knowledge and manual cross-referencing of supplier data, resulting in low
      quote fill rates.
    - >-
      Pricing pulls and lead-time calculations are inconsistent across
      suppliers; margin rules are applied ad hoc, causing margin leakage of 1–3
      pts per quote.
    - >-
      Volume spikes (month-end, seasonal bids) create bottlenecks that drive
      overtime, missed deadlines, and reduced win rates.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/CPQ modules don’t handle unstructured RFQs well and are
      costly to customize for agents/brokers who source across many suppliers.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into quote cycle KPIs (turnaround time, match rate, win
      rate by segment) hinders continuous improvement and sales forecasting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel RFQ intake: parse email bodies, attachments (PDF, Excel,
      Word), web portal downloads, and EDI; auto-thread RFQs by
      buyer/opportunity.
    - >-
      AI extraction and normalization: detect line items, quantities, UoM,
      brand/MPN, specs; normalize synonyms and pack sizes; flag missing info for
      human-in-the-loop.
    - >-
      Catalog and supplier matching: fuzzy and semantic matching to in-house
      catalog plus supplier price lists; suggest nearest alternates and
      equivalents with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing and lead-times: pull cost and availability via supplier
      feeds/APIs; apply configurable margin rules and MOQs; compute promised
      ship dates and freight options.
    - >-
      Quote drafting and approval: auto-generate buyer-ready quotes (branding,
      T&Cs); route for approval based on margin thresholds; version control and
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Integrations: bidirectional sync with CRM/ERP (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot,
      NetSuite, SAP B1, Epicor P21, Infor SX.e); export to CPQ/EDI; attach quote
      PDFs to CRM opportunity.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboards for turnaround time, match rate, win rate, margin
      performance; per-rep and per-buyer insights; exception root-cause
      analysis.
    - >-
      Compliance and security: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML, PII redaction, data
      residency options; granular role-based access and audit logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut RFQ-to-quote time from days to minutes with 95%+ line-item extraction
    accuracy, supplier-aware matching, and margin-safe, buyer-ready
    quotes—purpose-built for agents and brokers who must source across many
    catalogs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound data advantage from cross-buyer RFQ templates, supplier-specific
    pricing/lead-time nuances, and continuous human-in-the-loop
    feedback—embedded into a product graph and fine-tuned models specialized for
    agents/brokers. Deep ERP/CPQ integrations and approval workflows create
    switching costs and defensibility beyond generic OCR or LLM tools.

  character: >-
    Wholesale trade agents and brokers who juggle high-volume, multi-format RFQs
    and must respond fast without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as PDFs, spreadsheets, and emails; extracting line
    items, mapping to catalog SKUs, computing pricing and lead-times, and
    assembling buyer-ready quotes is slow and error-prone. Internal: Teams feel
    buried, miss cutoffs, and distrust manual spreadsheets. Philosophical:
    Buyers deserve accurate quotes in hours, not days.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the quoting grind and the risk of errors that cost
    deals and margins. Authority: Built by B2B pricing/procurement veterans;
    integrates with your catalog, price lists, and ERP/CRM; provides confidence
    scores and audit trails; secured with data isolation and role-based access.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect data sources (catalog, price lists, ERP/CRM). 2) Forward
    RFQs to a dedicated inbox or API. 3) Review and approve AI-drafted quotes;
    adjust rules as needed. Agreement: Human-in-the-loop, no change to buyer
    workflow, data never shared or used to train public models, reversible
    setup.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot with your own RFQs. Transitional:
    Download sample output and an ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    Respond in minutes, not days; quote more deals with the same team; higher
    win rates from faster, consistent quotes; protected margins via rule-based
    pricing; reliable lead-time commitments; complete audit trail and
    compliance-ready documentation.
  failure: >-
    Without it: slow, inconsistent responses; missed deadlines; lost deals to
    faster competitors; margin leakage from manual errors; burned-out teams and
    frustrated buyers.
