  problem:
    - >-
      Foremen spend 30–60 minutes daily assembling reports from scattered
      photos, texts, and headcounts, leading to overtime, low compliance, and
      frustration.
    - >-
      GCs often reject or question daily reports due to missing weather,
      inconsistent formatting, or incomplete manpower/production details,
      causing delays and back charges.
    - >-
      Owners lack timely, structured production data by cost code (e.g., board
      hung, batts installed) to compare against budgets, making it hard to spot
      slippage early.
    - >-
      Field teams are bilingual and often offline; existing tools feel heavy,
      require too much typing, and don’t fit the reality of
      WhatsApp/photo-centric workflows.
    - >-
      Duplicate data entry across apps (photos in CompanyCam, timecards
      elsewhere, reports in PDFs) wastes time and increases errors.
    - >-
      Small/mid subcontractors can’t justify enterprise platforms (cost and
      complexity) just to produce daily logs acceptable to GCs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Capture: Foreman sends photos, short voice notes, and crew counts via
      mobile app or SMS/WhatsApp; works offline and syncs later.
    - >-
      Compose: AI structures a daily report with activities, manpower by
      trade/crew, quantities installed by cost code, and issues/impacts.
      Includes auto-location and weather.
    - >-
      Validate: Foreman reviews a one-screen summary, corrects via quick
      taps/voice, and e-signs. Report completeness indicator ensures key fields
      are covered.
    - >-
      Deliver: GC-ready PDF and email with company branding, timestamped photos,
      and weather. Copies to cloud drive and project folder automatically.
    - >-
      Track: Office dashboard rolls up production vs budget, highlights
      exceptions (delays, access issues, RFIs), and creates a weekly summary for
      billing support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From field photos, notes, and headcounts to a GC-ready daily report in under
    10 minutes—auto-weather, production tracking by cost code, bilingual voice
    capture, and instant PDF/email delivery that GCs accept.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned dataset for drywall/insulation daily reporting (EN/ES) and a
    pre-approved template library from major GCs, combined with an
    offline-capable, photo/voice-first workflow that matches how foremen already
    work (including SMS/WhatsApp)—reducing friction and rejections more than
    generic reporting tools.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Small-to-mid Drywall & Insulation subcontractors (5–200 field
      workers) in the US and Canada who are required to submit daily reports to

      seeking standardized reporting across projects and regions.
    - >-
      Influencers: General Contractors that require specific daily log formats;
      they may promote adoption by preferred subs.
    - >-

      engineers/superintendents, project managers, and operations/owners who
      rely on production dashboards.
