  title: ASN-to-Receiving Reconciliation Agent
  description: >-
    Automatically reconciles vendor ASNs and packing lists with WMS receipts,
    flags discrepancies, drafts vendor communications, and creates receiving
    tasks.
  targetUsers:
    - Receiving manager
    - Inventory control
    - 3PL operations
  triggers:
    - New EDI 856 ASN received
    - Truck check-in event
    - 'Scheduled pre-receiving batch (e.g., hourly)'
  inputs:
    - EDI 850/856/855
    - WMS PO/receipt data
    - PDF/email packing lists
    - Vendor item master/UPC mappings
    - Scanner logs
  steps:
    - Ingest and normalize ASNs/packing lists; OCR PDFs if needed
    - Match expected vs. received at item/lot/serial/qty level
    - >-
      Score discrepancies (over/short/damage, barcode mismatch) and propose root
      cause
    - >-
      Auto-draft vendor discrepancy email with evidence; request photos if
      needed
    - Create WMS receiving/inspection tasks; hold/clear recommendations
    - 'Log KPIs (dock-to-stock, discrepancy rate) and publish report'
  tools:
    - 'EDI translator (e.g., Cleo/SPS)'
    - 'OCR (e.g., Google Vision/Tesseract)'
    - LLM for correspondence/templates
    - WMS API connector
    - Slack/Teams and email API
  outputs:
    - Reconciliation report
    - Receiving/inspection task list
    - Vendor discrepancy email drafts
    - Exception queue with recommended actions
  pricingModel:
    - Setup fee (mapping)
    - Per-location monthly
    - Per-ASN overage tier
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 4.5
  risks:
    - Incorrect SKU/UPC mapping leading to false exceptions
    - Limited WMS API access
    - Vendor pushback on automated claims
    - Data latency from EDI providers
  dependencies:
    - WMS API credentials
    - EDI feed access
    - Vendor/SKU cross-reference tables
    - SOP for discrepancy handling
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual ASN/packing list vs. WMS receipt reconciliation consumes 1–3 FTEs
      per 100 receipts/day (10–20 seconds/line; 3,000–6,000 lines/day = 8–17
      hours/day).
    - >-
      3–8% of receipt lines contain exceptions (over/short/damage,
      unit-of-measure mismatches, lot/serial/expiry issues, PO vs. ASN
      variances), delaying putaway and increasing dock-to-stock time by 0.5–1.5
      days.
    - >-
      Inconsistent vendor communication leads to slow dispute resolution and
      missed chargebacks; 0.2–0.8% margin leakage due to unclaimed discrepancies
      or write-offs.
    - >-
      WMS-native tools often lack cross-document reconciliation (ASN + packing
      list + receipt) and automated task creation, so exceptions linger and
      receiving throughput suffers.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation (EDI 856, PDF/email packing lists, WMS APIs) creates
      blind spots; leaders lack vendor scorecards, exception aging, and
      root-cause insights.
    - >-
      Workforce volatility and training gaps cause error-prone receiving and
      compliance risk (GS1-128/UCC-128 label handling, lot traceability,
      FDA/FSMA for certain categories).
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize inbound data: EDI 856/810/850 via EDI partners/SFTP,
      PDF/email packing lists (OCR), GS1/UCC-128 label scans, and WMS receipts
      via APIs or flat files.
    - >-
      Reconcile at carton/pallet/line: match SKUs/GTINs/UPCs, quantities, UoM,
      lot/serial/expiry, PO/line, and handling unit IDs with configurable
      tolerances and rules (substitution/pack-size mapping).
    - >-
      Flag and classify exceptions (OS&D, UoM mismatch, missing lot/expiry, ASN
      without receipt, receipt without ASN, duplicate ASN, label/readability
      issues) with confidence scores.
    - >-
      Draft vendor communications: pre-filled discrepancy emails with line-level
      deltas, photos/signatures, chargeback calculations, and response-by dates;
      route by vendor profile; optionally post to vendor portal.
    - >-
      Create WMS tasks automatically: recount, reweigh, rescan label,
      quarantine, capture photos, cycle count, or escalate; push via WMS API/RPA
      with SLA timers.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards: first-pass match rate, exception aging, vendor
      scorecards, receiving lines per labor hour, and recovery dollars captured;
      export to BI or push webhooks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop UI: operators review flagged exceptions, accept/modify
      draft emails, and one-click push tasks; feedback trains models for
      vendor-specific patterns.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2-ready architecture, audit trails, PII
      minimization, role-based access, SSO, VPC peering/PrivateLink;
      configurable data retention.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut receiving exception time by 60–80% and increase dock-to-stock throughput
    20–40% by automatically reconciling ASNs and packing lists with WMS
    receipts, drafting vendor-ready discrepancy emails, and creating directed
    receiving tasks—plug-in connectors, human-in-the-loop, and measurable ROI in
    60 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-trained reconciliation models and a growing library of vendor-specific
    mappings across multiple WMS/EDI stacks, enabling high first-pass match
    rates within weeks; automated vendor communications and WMS task
    orchestration not offered by EDI networks or most WMS out-of-the-box;
    anonymized cross-client benchmarks for vendor scorecards; rapid integration
    via reusable connectors and an on-prem agent for legacy systems; enterprise
    security posture and auditability tailored to 3PL needs.
