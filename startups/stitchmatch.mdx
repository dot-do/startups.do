  problem:
    - >-
      Shoppers struggle to find exact fabric/thread colors from inspiration
      photos; online color selection is slow, imprecise, and leads to cart
      abandonment.
    - >-
      Retailers carry thousands of SKUs (solids, prints, threads, notions) with
      inconsistent color data; manual tagging is labor-intensive and inaccurate.
    - >-
      Mobile photos vary widely by lighting/white balance; generic image search
      fails on textiles and brand-specific thread codes.
    - >-
      Retailers lack an easy way to connect inspiration (photos, palettes) to
      in-stock items with real-time availability and shoppable links.
    - >-
      Resulting pain: lower conversion (2–3% typical), high bounce on
      color-filter pages, and missed attachment sales (threads/notions to
      fabric).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI pipeline normalizes lighting/white balance, extracts dominant and
      accent color palettes, and identifies textures/prints vs solids.
    - >-
      Maps photo colors to retailer inventory using brand-accurate color
      libraries (e.g., Kona, Bella Solids; DMC, Aurifil, Gutermann) and a vector
      search tuned for textiles.
    - >-
      Real-time inventory sync ensures recommendations are in stock with
      size/yardage variants and price tiers.
    - >-
      Embeddable widget (web/mobile) and API return top matches plus
      complementary matches (threads/notions) with add-to-cart links.
    - >-
      Shopper UX supports: upload photo, pick a target area/palette, see closest
      matches with ΔE00 color distance, and buy.
    - >-
      Retail analytics show engagement, conversion uplift, AOV lift, and popular
      palettes; A/B testing included.
    - >-
      Admin tools for color calibration using reference tiles and automated SKU
      color profiling from product images or swatch scans.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any customer photo into a precise, in-stock fabric/thread match with
