  problem:
    - >-
      Underutilized inventory and uneven store-level demand lead to idle days
      and lost revenue, especially for TVs, smartphones, laptops,
      washers/dryers, and refrigerators.
    - >-
      Static price books and manual promo changes cannot react to micro-local
      demand, seasonality, weather, events, and competitor moves; price changes
      often take days/weeks.
    - >-
      Blanket promotions and flat discounts erode margins and cannibalize
      full-price rentals; promo ROI is rarely measured beyond top-line lift.
    - >-
      No SKU/location/duration elasticity understanding; inability to balance
      utilization, margin, and inventory age/condition simultaneously.
    - >-
      Rapid depreciation and obsolescence of electronics magnify the cost of
      holding inventory; aging stock requires targeted price actions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across POS/ERP/e-commerce prevents closed-loop testing and
      automatic guardrails; operators fear price errors and compliance risks.
    - >-
      Competitive pressure from marketplaces, BNPL, and subscription models
      demands dynamic offers (deposit, term length, bundle pricing), but legacy
      systems lack this flexibility.
    - >-
      Lack of explainability and governance for price variation risks brand
      trust and regulatory scrutiny.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer: connectors to POS/ERP/e-comm to ingest transactions,
      inventory, store attributes, service costs, promo history, and price
      constraints.
    - >-
      Elasticity and demand modeling per SKU-location-duration-condition using
      hierarchical Bayesian and gradient-boosted models; cold-start via
      attribute similarity and market signals.
    - >-
      Real-time price and promo optimizer that balances utilization, margin,
      inventory age, and service cost under guardrails (min/max, brand rules,
      legal).
    - >-
      Competitor and market signal ingestion (online prices, local events,
      weather, foot traffic) to pre-empt demand spikes/lulls.
    - >-
      Experimentation engine for A/B and multi-arm bandits; auto-stop on
      negative impact; geographic split and holdouts for causal measurement.
    - >-
      Workflow and governance: approval queues, audit logs, explainability
      (feature attributions), and rollback with one click; human-in-the-loop
      overrides.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate price/promo strategies, budget-constrained
      promo allocation, and what-if analyses for seasonal inventory builds.
    - >-
      APIs and adapters to push price lists to POS, e-comm, and marketplaces at
      configurable cadences (real-time, hourly, daily).

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Rental category and revenue managers at consumer electronics and appliance
    rental companies who must hit utilization and margin targets without
    constant manual repricing.
  problem: >-
    External: Static prices and blunt promos by store/SKU cause idle inventory,
    stockouts, and margin leakage. Internal: Teams are guessing, firefighting,
    and unsure what will work. Philosophical: Pricing should be fair, fast, and
    data-driven.
  guide: >-
    We understand demand volatility and promo fatigue; our team has built
    pricing engines that make millions of decisions daily and deliver measurable
    lift in utilization and gross margin.
  plan: >-
    Connect POS, inventory, and competitor feeds; run a 4-week pilot in selected
    locations to set floors, ceilings, and brand rules; go live with guardrails,
    optional human approvals, and daily SKU/location price and promo updates
    that continuously learn.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute assessment, get a free utilization/margin uplift forecast,
    and start a low-risk pilot.
  success: >-
    Higher utilization and GM%, smarter promos that move the right SKUs, faster
    response to local demand swings, fewer stockouts/overstocks, and a CFO-ready
    ROI dashboard.
  failure: >-
    Keep leaving units idle or overpriced, burn margin with blanket discounts,
    overload teams with manual updates, and lose share to faster competitors.
