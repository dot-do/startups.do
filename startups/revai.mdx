leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow first response: Many dealers reply to new web/SMS/email inquiries in
      hours, not minutes; lead conversion drops 8–10x after 5 minutes and almost
      to zero after 30 minutes.
    - >-
      Inconsistent qualification: Sales teams skip structured discovery (budget,
      riding style, experience, trade-in, financing), causing poor fit
      recommendations and wasted test rides.
    - >-
      Lead leakage across channels: Website chat, Facebook/Instagram leads,
      Google Vehicle Ads, OEM lead forms, and walk-in follow-ups are siloed; no
      unified triage or attribution.
    - >-
      Inventory mismatch: Reps often don’t check live availability or
      alternatives; customers get quoted sold units or miss in-stock
      substitutes.
    - >-
      Appointment friction: Back-and-forth scheduling and off-hours coverage
      reduce booked showroom/test-ride appointments and show rates.
    - >-
      Staff turnover and seasonality: New/seasonal reps lack product knowledge
      and process consistency; peak season overwhelms teams.
    - >-
      Compliance risk: TCPA/CAN-SPAM/CASL violations from manual
      texting/emailing; poor opt-in/opt-out handling.
    - >-
      Poor visibility: Dealers lack clear metrics on lead response time,
      qualified rate, appointment set rate, show rate, and sales impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI lead triage across SMS/email/webchat with sub-60s first response SLA;
      24/7 coverage.
    - >-
      Structured qualification flows tailored to powersports (riding style/use
      case, experience, budget/credit range, trade-in, accessories, terrain).
    - >-
      Live inventory-aware recommendations: Map buyer needs to in-stock units,
      suggest 2–3 best matches plus alternates if primary is sold-out; support
      trims, VIN-level status, incentives.
    - >-
      Frictionless scheduling: Real-time calendar availability for
      sales/test-ride bays; automatic confirmations, reminders, and
      rescheduling; optional deposit capture link if dealer supports.
    - >-
      CRM/DMS sync: Create/update lead, notes, qualification answers,
      recommended units, and appointment objects; deduplicate by email/phone;
      attribute source channel.
    - >-
      Reactivation workflows: Nurture stalled leads with compliant follow-ups;
      pull back prospects when inventory matches or incentives change.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Smart handoff to sales rep; “Ask human” button; agent
      assist suggestions in CRM.
    - >-
      Compliance by design: TCPA/CAN-SPAM/CASL compliant opt-in/out, quiet
      hours, language templates; audit logs.
    - >-
      Analytics: Dealer dashboard for response time, qualification rate,
      appointment set rate, show rate, sales rate, by channel/source and by
      model line.
    - >-
      Multilingual (EN/ES initial), brand-voice tuning, and OEM-model knowledge
      packs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every lead into a qualified, inventory-matched showroom or test-ride
    appointment in under 60 seconds—24/7—across SMS, email, and webchat, with
    real-time inventory recommendations and CRM-safe compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Powersports-specific AI trained on dealer transcripts, OEM model libraries,
    and inventory semantics; ready-made integrations to leading powersports
    CRMs/web providers; inventory-aware recommendations plus test-ride
    scheduling in one flow; compliance-by-design for texting and email with
    auditable logs. These reduce time-to-value and outperform generic chat/SMS
    tools that lack inventory context.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Motorcycle, ATV, and other motor vehicle dealers (NAICS 441227) who want
    more qualified showroom appointments from inbound leads without adding
    headcount.
  problem: >-
    Leads go cold because responses are slow—especially after hours and on
    weekends. Sales teams juggle calls, emails, and chats, so follow-up is
    inconsistent and time is lost on unqualified shoppers. Buyers expect instant
    answers; you deserve every serious lead to be qualified and booked.

    We understand the powersports sales cycle and fast-moving inventory. Our AI
    replies in seconds via SMS, email, and webchat, qualifies needs, recommends
    in-stock units, and books showroom/test-ride appointments—under your rules
    and branding, with full visibility.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your inventory feed and messaging channels; 2) Configure
    qualifying questions, featured models, and appointment windows; 3) Go live,
    then review weekly results and fine-tune.
  callToAction: Book a 15-minute demo and launch a pilot at one store.
  success: >-
    Capture and qualify every lead 24/7, set more appointments, increase show
    rates, keep test-ride calendars full, free your team to close and deliver,
    and maintain clean pipeline data.
  failure: >-
    Miss hot leads to faster competitors, keep inboxes overloaded, waste floor
    time on unqualified shoppers, and leave appointment slots—and revenue—empty.
