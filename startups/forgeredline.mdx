leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High defect and rework rate in die designs: 15–30% of new impression-die
      tools require at least one redesign loop due to underfill, laps, die
      cracking, or trimming issues.
    - >-
      Manual design reviews are slow and inconsistent: 4–16 engineer-hours per
      job for checks on draft, radii, parting line, flash land, and blocker
      geometry.
    - >-
      CAE simulation is valuable but time-consuming: typical setup 2–6 hours per
      iteration; used too late, often after tooling is cut.
    - >-
      Preform and flash geometry optimization relies on tribal knowledge,
      causing variation in fill, tonnage, and die life across shifts and plants.
    - >-
      Cost impact is material: a single failed tryout can waste $3k–$20k in
      steel, energy, press time, and labor; annual avoidable costs per plant
      often exceed $250k.
    - >-
      Die life is unpredictable: incorrect radii, stress concentrations, and
      poor thermal balance reduce die life by 10–40%, increasing downtime and
      tooling cost.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows: CAD in NX/Creo/SolidWorks, CAE in DEFORM/QForm/Forge
      NxT, redlines in PDFs/emails → traceability and learning loops are lost.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced die designers: retirements outpace new talent;
      onboarding takes 6–12 months without structured, searchable best-practice
      guidance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated CAD ingestion and feature recognition for forging-specific
      checks (drafts, fillets, parting line, flash land/relief, blocker/finisher
      consistency).
    - >-
      Best-practice rules engine for material- and process-specific constraints
      (e.g., 42CrMo4 hot forging) with plant-tunable standards.
    - >-
      Preform generator that proposes blocker/preform shapes to achieve target
      volume distribution and flow, with quick-load and fill estimates.
    - >-
      Flash and gutter optimizer that recommends land width, thickness, and
      gutter geometry to ensure fill while controlling load and trimming.
    - >-
      One-click redline package: annotated CAD model, 2D drawings with flagged
      issues, and change proposals with before/after deltas.
    - >-
      Rapid screening simulation (reduced-order flow and load estimation) and
      auto-setup export for DEFORM/QForm/Forge NxT for high-fidelity runs.
    - >-
      Press and heating envelope checks to validate machine capability, energy
      usage, and cycle-time implications.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture tryout outcomes to refine rules and models
      per plant, part family, and material grade.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered die design review and automated redlining that catches forging
    risks in minutes and proposes manufacturable preform and flash changes,
    cutting review time by 70–85%, reducing rework 30%+, and extending die life
    10–20%, with direct CAD/CAE integrations and quantified ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary corpus linking die geometry, process parameters, and
    real tryout outcomes, enabling plant- and material-specific recommendations
    that generic CAE or CAD checkers cannot match, plus one-click,
    bi-directional CAD/CAE redlining that compresses the
    design–simulation–tryout loop.

  character: >-
    Forge die designers and process engineers at iron and steel shops who want
    first-pass-right dies, predictable tryouts, and fewer surprises.
  problem: >-
    Villain: hidden forming risks locked in CAD and tribal knowledge. External:
    laps, underfill, foldover, hotspots, premature die wear, flash imbalance.
    Internal: pressure to hit dates with limited bandwidth and confidence before
    first hit. Philosophical: good die design should not depend on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Die Design Review & Redline Agent — an AI co-pilot trained on forging best
    practices and your shop context. Empathetic to real-world constraints;
    authoritative with clear, physics-informed rationale and traceable rules.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload die CAD and process notes. 2) Agent flags risks vs. forging best
    practices and proposes preform/flash geometry changes with redlines and
    rationale. 3) Approve updates; export revised geometry and a sign-off report
    (FEA-ready), with optional PDM/PLM integration.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 2–4 week pilot on 3 part numbers. Transitional: Book a
    30-minute demo or request a free sample redline on one STEP file.
  success: >-
    More first-pass-right dies, faster tryouts, less scrap and rework, balanced
    flash and fill, longer die life, predictable launches, captured tribal
    knowledge, stronger quotes and customer trust.
  failure: >-
    Without it: more trial loops and hot fixes, die crashes, schedule slips,
    margin erosion, overtime, and repeat quality escapes.
