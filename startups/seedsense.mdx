  title: Variable-Rate Seeding and Hybrid Placement Prescriptions
  description: >-
    Data-driven seeding rates and hybrid zones to optimize emergence and yield
    across spatial variability.
  targetUsers:
    - Corn growers
    - Independent agronomists
    - Seed dealers
  triggers:
    - 4–6 weeks before planting
    - After hybrids selected
    - When historical yield/maps are available
  inputs:
    - Field boundaries (shapefile/GeoJSON)
    - Historical yield maps (years >2 preferred)
    - 'Soil data (SSURGO/SoilGrids, EC if available)'
    - Elevation/DEM
    - Multi-year satellite vigor (NDVI/EVI)
    - 'Equipment constraints (min/max rate, file format)'
    - Chosen hybrids and relative maturity
  steps:
    - Ingest boundaries and normalize datasets
    - Cluster management zones from multi-year yield/vegetation/soil/elevation
    - Estimate zone-specific seeding response curves and population ranges
    - Assign hybrids to zones (optional) based on stress tolerance and GDU fit
    - Generate variable-rate seeding Rx within equipment constraints
    - QA with grower; export ISOXML/Shapefile; optional push to Ops Center
  tools:
    - Google Earth Engine or Sentinel Hub API (Sentinel-2/Landsat)
    - USDA SSURGO API / SoilGrids
    - GDAL/QGIS
    - scikit-learn (clustering/response curves)
    - John Deere Operations Center API (read/export)
    - AgLeader/ISOXML exporters
  outputs:
    - Management zone map (GeoTIFF/GeoJSON)
    - VRS prescription (ISOXML/Shapefile)
    - 1–2 page summary with assumptions and recommended checks
  pricingModel:
    - $1.50–$3.00 per acre; $250 farm minimum
    - 'Optional review call: +$100/session'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8

  risks:
    - Poor or miscalibrated yield data degrades zones
    - Equipment file-format mismatches
    - Hybrid recommendations may be constrained by availability
    - Liability if prescriptions not field-validated
  dependencies:
    - 'Grower shares boundaries, yield/as-applied data'
    - Access to satellite archives
    - Equipment compatibility for Rx files
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Large within-field variability (often 30–60 bu/ac swing) makes flat
      seeding rates and generic hybrid choices leave profit on the table.
    - >-
      Many growers have VRS-capable planters but underuse them due to data
      wrangling, confusing tools, and lack of trusted agronomic logic.
    - >-
      Current scripts often ignore hybrid x environment response-to-population
      (RTP) and micro-topography; growers see inconsistent results and stop
      using VRS.
    - >-
      Hybrid placement is usually based on county-level trial data, not the
      specific environment types within each field.
    - >-
      Data integration is painful: yield maps, soil, elevation, and weather
      rarely align cleanly; file formats (ISOXML, shapefile, Deere .rx) cause
      last-minute planting issues.
    - >-
      Hard to prove ROI: few tools automate check-strips and post-harvest
      analysis tied to prescriptions; agronomists lack time to validate at
      scale.
    - >-
      Time burden: 4–8 hours per field to clean data and build an Rx is common,
      preventing agronomists from scaling services.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-year field data (yield, as-planted, soil EC/texture,
      elevation/slope, drainage, historic imagery) via connectors to John Deere
      Operations Center, Climate FieldView, CNH AFS, and shapefile/ISOXML
      uploads.
    - >-
      Environment typing: cluster each field into stable zones using
      topography-derived wetness indices, texture/EC, organic matter, and
      water-holding capacity; quantify zone stability across seasons.
    - >-
      Hybrid x environment modeling: use brand-agnostic RTP curves and GxE
      performance surfaces to recommend hybrids matched to each zone class.
    - >-
      Population optimization: for each zone-hybrid pair, optimize seeding rate
      for expected planting window weather and stand establishment risk; enforce
      planter and hybrid constraints (min/max population, rate change limits).
    - >-
      Prescription generation: create variable-rate and hybrid-zone maps with
      smooth transitions respecting machine capabilities; export ISOXML,
      shapefile, Deere .rx, CNH .cn1; verify file integrity.
    - >-
      On-planter delivery: push maps to Ops Center/FieldView and provide a
      USB-ready package with a step-by-step planter setup checklist.
    - >-
      In-season update option: if planting is delayed or weather shifts, recalc
      RTP and issue a rapid replan map in <2 hours.
    - >-
      Automated check-strips: embed randomized flat-rate and alternate-hybrid
      strips for unbiased ROI measurement; flag strip locations to operators.
    - >-
      Post-harvest analytics: auto-ingest yield, run statistical analysis on
      strips and zones, deliver ROI heatmaps, hybrid performance by environment,
      and next-year recs.
    - >-
      Collaborative QA: agronomist co-pilot mode to adjust business rules,
      approve maps, and track changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase corn profit by $10–20 per acre through genetics-aware,
    field-specific seeding rates and hybrid placement delivered to your planter
    in under 24 hours, with automated check-strips and ROI reporting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, brand-agnostic hybrid x environment and RTP dataset
    linked to verified check-strips, combined with a planter-aware optimization
    and delivery engine that minimizes operator friction. Partner integrations
    with JD/Climate and seed/retail networks create distribution lock-in, while
    our post-harvest ROI reporting drives trust and renewal.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Corn growers, farm managers, and agronomists who want to match seeding rates
    and hybrids to each acre’s variability to boost emergence, yield, and input
    efficiency.
  problem: >-
    External—Fields vary in soil, drainage, elevation, and residue; flat-rate
    seeding wastes seed and leaves yield on the table. Internal—You’re tired of
    guessing, juggling data layers and monitors, and risking uneven stands.
    Philosophical—Every acre deserves the right hybrid at the right rate.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit yield targets while controlling seed
    costs. Our agronomy and data science team brings precision-ag experience and
    on-farm validation, with privacy-first pipelines and integrations for major
    monitors and OEMs.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect boundaries, soil layers, imagery, yield history, and hybrid
    options; 2) AI generates variable-rate seeding and hybrid-zone prescriptions
    aligned to your goals and equipment; 3) Load, plant, and ground-truth; 4)
    Post-harvest analysis to refine next season.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct—Book a field assessment and pilot on one or two fields this season.
    Transitional—Download a sample prescription and ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    Uniform emergence, stronger stands, and higher yield potential; seed dollars
    targeted where they pay; confident, data-backed hybrid placement; continuous
    improvement each harvest; ROI you can show your lender and landlord.
  failure: >-
    Flat-rate across variability; over- or under-seeding; wrong hybrid on
    stressed acres; wasted seed and time; missed yield; analysis paralysis and
    guesswork.

  problem:
    - >-
      Uniform seeding wastes seed in poor zones and starves high-potential
      areas.
    - >-
      Guesswork hybrid placement risks yield drag when stress tolerance doesn’t
      fit the zone.
    - 'Manual zone drawing is slow, subjective, and hard to repeat.'
    - Data is scattered across monitors and platforms; exports are messy.
    - Prescriptions fail at the monitor due to format and equipment mismatches.
    - Hard to prove impact and refine decisions year over year.

      AI builds stable management zones from multi-year yield, soils, elevation,
      EC, and imagery.
    - Optimized seeding rates per zone aligned to your hybrids and goals.
    - >-
