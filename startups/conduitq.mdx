  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as unstructured emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, and STEP files;
      manual parsing and re-keying into ERP/CPQ takes 20–60 minutes per RFQ with
      error rates >3%.
    - >-
      Quote cycle times are slow (median 2–5 business days), causing lost deals
      to faster competitors and distributor SLAs being missed.
    - >-
      Pricing inconsistency and tribal knowledge lead to 1–3 percentage points
      of margin leakage and frequent quote rework.
    - >-
      Sales engineers spend 30–60% of time on repetitive custom-variant quotes
      (e.g., wall plate cutouts, enclosure knockouts), delaying higher-value
      engineering work.
    - >-
      Disjointed systems (email, shared drives, CAD, ERP/CPQ) create handoff
      failures and poor traceability; audit trails for what was quoted and why
      are weak.
    - >-
      High variability in RFQs (customer templates, incomplete specs, outdated
      drawings) causes quote errors and back-and-forth, raising cost-to-quote.
    - >-
      Uncaptured demand: backlogs cause smaller RFQs to be ignored or delayed,
      reducing win rate and channel partner satisfaction.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel RFQ ingestion: shared mailbox/IMAP, APIs, SFTP, and portal
      capture; deduplication and SLA-aware triage.
    - >-
      Document AI: layout-aware OCR/NLP to extract customer, item/variant
      parameters, quantities, delivery terms, compliance notes (UL/NEMA), and
      attachments; confidence scoring with human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      CAD/STEP intelligence: feature extraction for plates/enclosures (cutouts,
      hole patterns, bend features, knockouts, embosses, mounting options);
      param mapping to your product taxonomy; DFM checks.
    - >-
      Cost model builder: configurable rules per plant and process (material,
      blanking/punch/laser times, bending, tapping, welding, powder coat/paint,
      plating, assembly, packaging, freight); supports make/buy, MOQs, tooling
      amortization, scrap, and labor rates by shift.
    - >-
      Quote drafting: auto-generate line items, alternates, lead times, price
      breaks, and terms; apply margin guardrails, customer-specific pricing, and
      approval workflows; export to ERP/CPQ (Epicor, Infor, Oracle NetSuite, SAP
      B1, Salesforce CPQ) and CRM.
    - >-
      Learning loop: reconcile quoted vs. actual cost data to self-calibrate
      estimates and margin targets over time; track win/loss to optimize price
      bands by segment.
    - >-
      Analytics: RFQ intake, cycle time, automation rate, margin variance, hit
      rate by channel, and estimator productivity; audit trails for ISO/NEMA
      compliance.
    - >-
      Security and deployment: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML, audit logging,
      VPC/private cloud; optional on-prem deployment for ITAR/strict data
      policies.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Autopilot that ingests RFQs (email/PDF/STEP), understands variant
    requirements, and drafts costed, ready-to-send quotes in minutes with human
    approval—cutting quote time 70–90%, boosting win rates, and protecting
    margins with auditable, company-specific cost models.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Narrow vertical focus with proprietary geometry and costing templates for
    wiring devices/enclosures, plus feedback loops tying quotes to
    actuals—creating defensible, company-specific cost curves and higher
    automation than generic document AI or horizontal CPQ.

  character: >-
    Sales, estimating, and applications engineering teams at Noncurrent-Carrying
    Wiring Device manufacturers (NAICS 335932) who need to turn custom-variant
    RFQs (wall plates, enclosures, fittings, accessories) into accurate quotes
    fast.
  problem: >-
    - External: RFQs arrive as emails, PDFs, and STEP files; parsing specs,
    dimensions, and options is slow and error-prone; costing and BOM/routing
    creation are manual and inconsistent.

    - Internal: Estimators feel overworked and anxious about misquotes, missed
    deadlines, and late-night firefighting.

    - Philosophical: It’s wrong to lose business or margin because experts are
    stuck in copy-paste work instead of serving customers and improving designs.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know quoting custom variants from messy RFQs is tedious,
    risky, and time-sensitive.

    - Authority: Purpose-built AI for 335932 that reads emails/PDFs/STEP,
    understands catalog options and custom cutouts, drafts costed quotes with
    assumptions, and integrates with ERP/PLM/CRM—always with human-in-the-loop
    review.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Connect RFQ inbox/CAD intake and your pricing, catalogs, and routing
    rules.

    2) AI parses RFQs, extracts geometry/specs, maps to catalog/custom variants,
    builds BOM/routings, and drafts a costed quote with clear assumptions.

    3) Human reviews/edits; one-click send to customer and sync to ERP/CRM;
    system learns from approvals.

    Agreement:

    - Human approval required before anything is sent.

    - Private-by-design; deploy in your cloud or ours; audit trail on every
    quote.

    - Simple pricing—pilot fast, scale as you prove ROI.
