  problem:
    - >-
      Manual conversion from BIM/panel models to shop drawings and CNC posts
      (BTLx/DXF) consumes 4–12 labor hours per 50 panels and creates bottlenecks
      on rush jobs.
    - >-
      High first-article failure rates on CNC lines (10–20%) due to missed tool
      constraints, kerf compensation, datum mismatches, or layer naming errors;
      each failure can cost $500–$5,000 in downtime and scrap.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchains (Revit/cadwork/hsbcad/SEMA/IFC -> 2D CAD -> CAM)
      lead to data loss, inconsistent dimensioning standards, and duplicated
      BOMs.
    - >-
      Limited availability of skilled detailers/programmers; onboarding new
      staff takes 3–6 months, causing throughput volatility during seasonality
      or large project awards.
    - >-
      Machine vendor lock-in: posts optimized for one OEM often break on others
      (Weinmann/HOMAG, Hundegger, Randek, SCM, Biesse), restricting plant
      flexibility and subcontracting options.
    - >-
      Inconsistent drawing packages (missing dims, incorrect fastener schedules,
      poor revision control) lead to RFIs, production delays, and site rework.
    - >-
      Nesting and sheathing layouts are often done by hand, leaving 1–3%
      material yield on the table at current lumber/sheathing prices.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest panel models from IFC/Revit/hsbcad/cadwork/SEMA/Vertex BD;
      normalize geometry, metadata, and layers into a canonical panel schema.
    - >-
      AI-assisted rules engine applies plant-specific standards (datums,
      dimension styles, tolerances, fastener patterns, hold-backs, reveal gaps,
      machining offsets) and generates fully dimensioned shop drawings
      (PDF/DWG).
    - >-
      CNC post generation for supported machines: BTL/BTLx and DXF
      out-of-the-box; optional posts for WUP (Weinmann), woodWOP MPR (HOMAG),
      and vendor-specific macros as add-ons.
    - >-
      Automated sheathing layout and nesting with kerf compensation, bit
      selection, lead-ins/outs, and tool-path optimization to reduce cycle time
      and material waste.
    - >-
      Digital QA: geometry validation (collision checks, tool reachability,
      minimum edge distances), code/rule compliance checks, and simulation
      previews to catch errors pre-machine.
    - >-
      Traceability: revision diffs and change stamps on both drawings and
      machine files; QR-coded panel IDs linking to BOM, revision, and CNC
      program.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure cloud with on-premise connector (no direct
      machine control) or full on-prem for air-gapped plants.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to plant ERPs/MES (job numbers, status updates,
      production metrics) and label/printer systems.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-click, model-to-machine automation for prefab wood: generate dimensioned
    shop drawings and validated CNC posts (BTLx/DXF; optional
    WUP/woodWOP/MPR/BTL) in minutes with built-in QA, yielding 50–80% faster
    turnarounds and >98.5% first-pass machine success.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Certified, machine-validated post library across multiple OEMs plus a
    proprietary rules/validation engine trained on diverse panel datasets; tight
    OEM/software partnerships and first-pass success telemetry create a feedback
    loop competitors lack.

    drawings and machine-ready code from their panel models so production never
    waits on drafting or CAM.
  problem: >-
    Manual detailing and CAM prep slow projects, create BIM-to-shop errors, and
    force teams to juggle CNC formats. Engineers redline, operators fix bad
    code, deadlines slip, and margins shrink—though building in wood should be
    straightforward.
