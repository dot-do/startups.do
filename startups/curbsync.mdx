  problem:
    - >-
      Flight delays/early arrivals (commonly 20%+ of flights) cause missed or
      wasteful airport pickups, increasing no-shows, re-dispatching, and client
      dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Drivers incur costly idle time and parking fees when staged too early;
      dispatchers use fixed buffers and manual checks that don’t reflect
      real-time conditions.
    - >-
      Fragmented communications (passenger, dispatcher, chauffeur, affiliate)
      lead to inconsistent updates and SLA breaches for corporate accounts.
    - >-
      Existing tools in many dispatch systems offer basic flight lookups but
      lack predictive arrival, policy-based automation, multi-stakeholder logic,
      and auditability.
    - >-
      Operators can’t easily quantify or reduce operational waste (wait time,
      deadhead miles, overtime) tied to flight variability, hurting margins.
    - >-
      Diversions, gate changes, irregular ops (IRROPS), and airport curb/staging
      rules require rapid, rules-driven adjustments that most teams can’t
      execute consistently.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven flight monitoring combining real-time status with predictive
      models to estimate curbside-ready times by airport and terminal.
    - >-
      Policy/rules engine that auto-adjusts pickup times, reassigns chauffeurs,
      and updates staging instructions based on delays, early arrivals,
      diversions, and airport rules.
    - >-
      Automated, role-based notifications (passenger, chauffeur, dispatcher,
      affiliate) via SMS/WhatsApp/email with multilingual templates and audit
      trails.
    - >-
      Two-way integrations with leading livery dispatch platforms and
      calendars/PNR feeds to ingest bookings and push adjustments instantly.
    - >-
      Operator analytics to quantify reduced wait time, lowered parking spend,
      improved on-time pickups, and SLA adherence by client/account.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss an airport pickup and stop paying for idle time. CurbSync
    predicts flight-driven curbside timing and automatically adjusts pickups,
    assignments, and notifications—cutting driver wait time 30–50%, improving
    on-time performance to 95%+, and boosting client satisfaction while reducing
    dispatch workload.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary dataset linking flight milestones to curbside-ready times by
    airport/terminal combined with deep OEM integrations into livery dispatch
    systems creates switching costs and accuracy others can’t match.
    Vendor-neutral positioning, multi-stakeholder automation, and a documented
    ROI baseline-to-post methodology further differentiate. SOC 2 pursuit and
    airport policy knowledge base add trust and defensibility.
