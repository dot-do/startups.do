  title: RFP/Specification Parser → Compliance Matrix + Quote Stub
  description: >-
    AI parses customer RFQs/specs for meters/counters, builds compliance/gap
    matrix, proposes configuration and quote skeleton for review.
  targetUsers:
    - Sales engineering
    - Applications engineering
    - Bid/Proposal teams
  triggers:
    - New RFQ/spec PDF arrives in shared inbox/CRM
    - Sales requests compliance check
  inputs:
    - RFQ/spec PDFs
    - Product catalog/options/rules
    - Price list/CPQ data
    - 'Standard compliance library (OIML, ISO 4064, MID, AGA, NIST HB44)'
  steps:
    - OCR and sectionization of RFQ
    - >-
      Extract key parameters (fluid, range, accuracy class, approvals, end
      connections, display/IO, communication, hazardous area)
    - Match to catalog SKUs and options with rules
    - Build compliance/gap matrix with references to clauses
    - 'Draft quote line items, notes, deviations, lead-time estimate'
    - Route for human review/edits and publish to CRM/CPQ
  tools:
    - LLM with retrieval over product/standards KB

    - CRM/CPQ API access
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs/specifications for totalizing fluid meters and counting devices are
      long (100–800+ pages), varied in format (PDF, Word, scans), and reference
      standards (AWWA/ANSI/ISO/CSA/UL) that must be mapped precisely.
    - >-
      Proposal teams spend 8–40 hours per RFQ building compliance matrices and
      initial quotes, creating bottlenecks and delaying response times (often
      missing 48–72 hour target SLAs).
    - >-
      Manual parsing leads to missed requirements, inconsistent
      exceptions/clarifications, and costly rework or margin erosion from
      misconfiguration.
    - >-
      Knowledge is siloed across sales engineers and product managers, reducing
      repeatability and increasing onboarding time for new team members.
    - >-
      Existing RFP tools manage Q&A libraries but do not extract technical
      requirements or map to product configuration rules, leaving a critical
      gap.
    - >-
      Inaccurate or incomplete compliance matrices reduce technical win rates
      and damage credibility with EPCs, utilities, OEM customers, and
      distributors.
    - >-
      Traceability and auditability (citation to spec clause) are weak in manual
      workflows, increasing commercial and legal risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs/specs (PDF, Word, scans, drawings) and normalize content (OCR,
      table and figure extraction, unit normalization).
    - >-
      Extract and classify requirements (technical, standards, materials,
      testing, documentation, warranty, commercial) with clause-level citations.
    - >-
      Generate a compliance/gap matrix with pass/conditional/exception status,
      risks, and required clarifications; auto-flag deviations vs
      AWWA/ANSI/ISO/CSA/UL references.
    - >-
      Map requirements to product catalog and configuration rules to propose a
      validated configuration with options and assumptions.
    - >-
      Build a quote stub: prelim BOM, configurable options, pricing placeholders
      or tiers, lead-time banding, exceptions list, and questions for the
      customer.
    - >-
      Export to Excel/Word templates and push to CPQ/CRM/ERP; maintain version
      control and change diffs across RFQ revisions.
    - >-
      Provide a learning loop: feedback on extraction and mapping improves
      models; maintain an internal standards/answer library.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn complex RFQs/specs into an audit-ready compliance matrix and quote
    skeleton in minutes, not days—mapped to your catalog, rules, and standards
    with clause-level citations, measurable accuracy, and seamless CPQ/ERP
    handoff.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of meter/counter RFQs with clause-level
    labels and standards mappings plus customer-specific configuration
    graphs—creating a compounding accuracy lead and switching cost through
    embedded CPQ/ERP workflows and historical decision memory.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Bid, sales, and application engineers at totalizing fluid meter and counting
    device manufacturers (NAICS 334514) who must turn complex RFQs/specs into
    accurate, compliant quotes—fast.
  problem: >-
    Villain: Spec sprawl and revision churn. External: Customer requirements are
    long, inconsistent, and split across PDFs, drawings, and emails. Internal:
    Teams fear missing requirements, over‑engineering, or quoting the wrong
    configuration. Philosophical: Engineers should engineer—not manually mine
    specs.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know bid cycles are brutal and mistakes are costly. Authority: A
    domain‑tuned AI built for NAICS 334514 understands meters/counters,
    materials, ratings, approvals (AWWA, API, OIML, ISO, NIST, ATEX/IECEx,
    NSF/ANSI 61, 3‑A), NEMA/IP, and I/O (HART/Modbus/4–20 mA), with
    traceability, security, and human‑in‑the‑loop review.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload RFQ/spec docs. 2) Receive an auto‑built compliance/gap
    matrix with requirement trace links and a proposed configuration. 3) Export
    a quote stub (BOM, options, notes, exceptions) to CRM/ERP. Agreement: You
    retain control; nothing is released without your review; data stays private
    (VPC/on‑prem options, audit trail).
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a two‑week pilot on your own RFQs.
    Transitional: Download a sample compliance matrix and quote stub, plus an
    ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Reply in hours, not days; increase hit rates; reduce risk and change orders;
    protect margins; and deliver auditable compliance. Standardize quoting
    across teams and onboard new hires faster.
  failure: >-
    Miss hidden requirements, submit late or inaccurate quotes, absorb costly
    rework, face penalties, and lose credibility—and deals—to faster, more
    consistent competitors.

  problem:
    - >-
      Specs arrive as mixed PDFs, Word, Excel, and drawings—manual parsing is
      slow and error‑prone.
    - >-
      Engineers burn hours building Excel compliance matrices instead of
      designing solutions.
    - >-
      Missed requirements (hazardous approvals, materials, comms) trigger costly
      rework and lost bids.
    - >-
      Mapping spec language to your catalog options is inconsistent and relies
      on tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Quotes stall on exceptions/clarifications lists that aren’t traceable to
      spec clauses.
    - >-
      Multi‑line RFQs (different sizes, ranges, protocols) multiply effort and
      risk.
    - >-
      Auditability is weak—no clear trace from quote choices back to spec
      evidence.

    - >-
      Ingest RFQs/specs and auto-extract requirements for totalizing fluid
      meters and counting devices.
    - >-
      Generate a compliance/gap matrix with statuses (Compliant / Deviation /
      Assumption / Clarification) and page‑level citations.
    - >-
      Propose best‑fit configurations (meter/counter models, sizes, materials,
      I/O, approvals) aligned to your catalog limits.
    - >-
      Output a quote stub: part numbers/options, preliminary pricing fields,
      lead time placeholders, exclusions, and T&Cs blocks.
    - >-
      Surface risks early: missing approvals, out‑of‑range process conditions,
      incompatible comms, unrealistic turndown.
    - Export to Excel/Word/PDF and push to CPQ/ERP/CRM; keep a full audit trail.
    - >-
