    depth-of-investigation and section maps.

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual ERT/IP QC and inversion is slow and inconsistent: typical 2D line
      processing takes 1–3 hours of a geophysicist’s time per line, creating
      backlogs and delaying field decisions.
    - >-
      Data quality varies across OEMs and crews (contact resistance, poor
      electrodes, sferic noise, bad geometry), requiring expert heuristics that
      are not standardized and are costly to train for.
    - >-
      Existing desktop tools are powerful but not automated or collaborative;
      they require license management, high-skill operators, and manual
      report/section production.
    - >-
      Turnaround time matters: missed same-day QC leads to wasted mobilization
      days costing $5k–$20k/day on environmental and mining programs.
    - >-
      Clients increasingly require uncertainty and DOI mapping, but many
      deliverables omit it or estimate it inconsistently, undermining confidence
      in interpretations and permitting submissions.
    - >-
      Fragmented data formats (ABEM, Iris, Zonge, AGI, custom CSV) and
      topography handling slow integration with downstream tools (Leapfrog,
      Oasis montaj, QGIS).
    - >-
      Geophysical contractors face margin pressure; they need lower per-line
      processing costs without sacrificing quality or auditability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion for common file types (ABEM Terrameter/LS, Iris
      Syscal, AGI SuperSting, Zonge/Scintrex, CSV) with survey metadata capture,
      electrode geometry validation, and topography import (DEM or measured).
    - >-
      AI-assisted QC: reciprocity tests, spike/outlier detection, stack variance
      analysis, contact resistance screening, array geometry checks;
      auto-suggested fixes and confidence scores.
    - >-
      Physics-guided inversion engine built on robust, proven libraries (e.g.,
      pyGIMLi/SimPEG stack) with L1/L2 norms, smoothness constraints,
      topography, and error models; IP time-domain/chargeability options.
    - >-
      Depth of Investigation (DOI) and uncertainty quantification via
      sensitivity analysis, perturbation runs, and coverage maps; DOI polygons
      exported with sections.
    - >-
      Auto-generation of standardized outputs: pseudo-sections,
      resistivity/chargeability sections, DOI overlays, plan-view fence
      diagrams, multi-line stitched sections, and georeferenced exports
      (GeoTIFF, DXF, shapefile, PDF).
    - >-
      Web UI and API: project dashboards, batch runs, versioned workflows, audit
      trails; templated deliverables for clients and regulators (e.g., NI 43-101
      style appendices).
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud field pipeline: lightweight uploader that validates
      electrode layout on-site and streams partial stacks for rapid
      pre-inversion QC, enabling same-day re-shoot decisions.
    - >-
      Integrations: one-click export to Leapfrog, Oasis montaj, QGIS;
      S3/SharePoint connectors; OEM data log importers.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: flag lines requiring expert review; compare AI
      inversion vs operator-tuned run; built-in change logs for defensible
      reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From raw ERT/IP files to QC’d inversions with DOI and publication-ready
    sections in hours, not days—standardized, auditable, and
    instrument-agnostic. Cut per-line processing cost by 50–70% and enable
    same-day field decisions.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Network effects from aggregated, labeled multi-instrument ERT/IP datasets
    and embedded OEM workflows produce steadily improving QC heuristics and
    inversions that are hard to replicate. Audit-ready DOI/uncertainty and a
    same-day field pipeline create a defensible wedge vs. desktop-only
    incumbents.
