leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Method validation (per ICH Q2(R2), ISO/IEC 17025) is manual, error-prone,
      and slow; scientists spend 40–120 hours per method preparing protocols,
      calculating characteristics, and compiling reports.
    - >-
      Inconsistent calculations and undocumented assumptions lead to audit
      findings (e.g., incomplete traceability, incorrect LOD/LOQ methodology,
      missing robustness rationale).
    - >-
      Existing tools (Excel templates, generic stats packages) are not
      compliance-native; they lack audit trails, electronic signatures, and
      standards mapping needed for GxP/17025 environments.
    - >-
      Knowledge of current guidance (ICH Q2(R2) revision) is uneven across labs;
      acceptance criteria and statistical approaches vary by technique, causing
      rework and delays.
    - >-
      Integrations with CDS/LIMS/ELN are limited; data wrangling and manual
      transcription increase risk of transcription errors and OOS
      investigations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided protocol builder: select technique (HPLC/UPLC, GC, LC–MS, GC–MS,
      UV-Vis, ICP-MS, FTIR, qPCR), matrix, and intended use; system proposes
      validation plan with acceptance criteria aligned to ICH Q2(R2)/17025 and
      internal SOPs.
    - >-
      Deterministic stats engine: validated algorithms for accuracy, precision
      (repeatability/intermediate), linearity, range, LOD/LOQ (signal-to-noise,
      calibration curve, SD of response), specificity, robustness; transparent
      formulas and references.
    - >-
      Data ingestion: import raw or processed data from CDS (e.g., Empower,
      Chromeleon), LIMS/ELN (LabWare, LabVantage), and CSV; automatic parsing,
      unit checks, and audit trail of transformations.
    - >-
      Robustness and DoE: built-in factorial/Plackett–Burman designs with
      power/sample size calculators; stability of responses across factors with
      plots and ANOVA.
    - >-
      Automated report compiler: generates ICH/ISO-compliant protocol and final
      report with traceability matrix, acceptance decisions, plots, residuals,
      and e-signatures (21 CFR Part 11/Annex 11).
    - >-
      Change control and versioning: full audit trail, reviewer/approver
      workflows, and deviation capture; export to PDF/Word and submission
      packages.
    - >-
      Knowledge guardrails: standards mapping, glossary, and rationale library
      with citations; AI produces text only when supported by data and guidance,
      flagged for review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-assisted, compliance-native method validation that designs protocols,
    performs statistically correct calculations, and generates audit-ready
    reports mapped to ICH Q2(R2) and ISO/IEC 17025—cutting cycle time by 60–80%
    and reducing documentation deviations to near zero.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compliance-native automation: a pre-validated, clause-mapped protocol/report
    engine with full algorithm transparency, audit trails, and CSV packages,
    plus reference-site endorsements demonstrating clean inspections—difficult
    for generic AI or stats tools to replicate quickly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Lab managers, method developers, and QA leads at testing laboratories who
    want fast, defensible method validations.
  problem: >-
    External: manual, error-prone protocols and calculations; scattered
    spreadsheets; inconsistent alignment with ICH Q2(R2) and ISO/IEC 17025.
    Internal: pressure to hit deadlines and pass audits with limited resources.
    Philosophical: scientists should focus on science, not formatting documents.
  guide: >-
    We understand audit pressure and validation bottlenecks. Our AI embeds ICH
    Q2 and ISO/IEC 17025 logic, verifies stats for accuracy, precision,
    linearity, LOD/LOQ, and robustness, and outputs traceable, audit-ready
    reports used by regulated labs.
  plan: >-
    1) Define method, matrix, and acceptance criteria. 2) Auto-generate protocol
    and run studies as instructed. 3) Upload results; we compute validation
    characteristics and produce a compliant, sign-ready report with
    calculations, plots, and traceability.
  callToAction: Start a pilot with one method or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Validation cycles shrink from weeks to days; reports are consistently
    ICH/ISO-compliant; fewer iterations and corrections; faster approvals; clear
    traceability; confident audits.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines, nonconformities, failed audits, rework, client churn, and
    rising costs from spreadsheet errors and inconsistent documentation.
