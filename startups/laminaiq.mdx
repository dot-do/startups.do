  title: Yield & Scrap Root-Cause Analytics
  description: >-
    Finds drivers of scrap (bubbles, delamination, thickness variation, surface
    defects) from process/QC/machine data and recommends setpoint or procedural
    changes.
  targetUsers:

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap rates (bubbles, delamination, thickness variation, surface defects)
      of 5–12% are common in laminated plastics; root causes are multi-factor
      and often unidentified for weeks.
    - >-
      Process data (extrusion/lamination lines, calenders, ovens) is siloed
      across PLC/SCADA, MES, QMS, LIMS, and lab reports, preventing fast
      correlation with defects.
    - >-
      Engineers rely on tribal knowledge, SPC charts, and trial-and-error,
      leading to slow corrective actions and lost production time during
      changeovers.
    - >-
      Existing analytics tools surface correlations but rarely provide
      actionable, explainable setpoint or procedural recommendations tailored to
      lamination processes.
    - >-
      Quality escapes trigger costly rework/claims and customer scorecard
      penalties; lack of traceability and genealogy slows containment.
    - >-
      Limited data science resources in mid-size manufacturers hinders
      building/maintaining bespoke models; generic tools underperform without
      domain features.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turnkey data ingestion from PLC/SCADA (Rockwell, Siemens, Ignition),
      historians (OSIsoft PI), MES/QMS, and lab results; automatic
      time-alignment and batch/genealogy mapping.
    - >-
      Domain-specific multivariate root-cause analytics: causality graphs,
      SHAP-based driver ranking, and windowed time-lag analysis tuned for
      extrusion/lamination dynamics.
    - >-
      Prescriptive recommendations: suggested setpoints, recipe tweaks, and
      procedural changes with confidence intervals and expected scrap impact.
    - >-
      What-if simulator: change virtual setpoints to estimate defect probability
      and throughput/yield tradeoffs before touching the line.
    - >-
      Golden-run library and drift detection: learn stable operating envelopes
      per product/recipe; alert on deviation and recommend recovery actions.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot app (desktop/mobile/HMI): clear reason codes,
      step-by-step adjustments, acknowledgement workflow, and feedback capture
      for continuous learning.
    - >-
      Changeover optimizer: recommends preheat, nip, tension, and line speed
      profiles by product family to minimize ramp-up waste.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration: push recommendations to PLC/MES (where
      permitted), create QMS CAPAs with root cause evidence, and track outcomes.
    - >-
      Deployment model: secure on-premise edge gateway for real-time analytics +
      cloud for training and fleet benchmarking; IT/OT friendly.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, process, and quality leaders at laminated plastics
    plate/sheet/shape manufacturers who want to lift yield, tame variability,
    and stop recurring scrap without guesswork.
  problem: >-
    External: scrap from bubbles, delamination, thickness variation, and surface
    defects. Internal: too many variables, noisy data silos, tribal knowledge,
    and firefighting. Philosophical: you shouldn’t have to guess root causes
    when the data already exists.
  guide: >-
    We understand heated lamination and calendaring complexity—and the cost of
    scrap. Our AI + process-engineering service pinpoints multivariate drivers
    from process/QC/machine data and recommends safe setpoint/procedure changes,
    with secure deployment and vendor‑agnostic integrations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data (press/laminator/calender/oven lines, QC/LIMS, MES) and
    align defect taxonomy. 2) Run root‑cause models and digital DoE to isolate
    drivers and recommend setpoint/procedural changes with guardrails. 3) Deploy
    recommendations, alerts, and dashboards; train teams and iterate in weekly
    CI cycles.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a discovery call or start a 4‑week pilot on one line.
    Transitional: request a sample analysis on historical data and an ROI
    estimate.
  success: >-
    Double‑digit scrap reduction; stabilized thickness and adhesion; fewer
    bubbles/delam; higher Cpk and first‑pass yield; faster changeovers; shared
    playbooks; on‑time delivery and margin lift.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing scrap and rework; conservative setpoints that waste resin and time;
    late orders, chargebacks, and lost bids; burned‑out teams and stalled
    continuous improvement.
