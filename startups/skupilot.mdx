leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Buyers spend 10–20 hours/week manually creating POs from spreadsheets,
      vendor catalogs, and POS exports; errors cause stockouts and waste.
    - >-
      High SKU volatility from seasonality, weather, local events, and promos
      makes simple moving averages unreliable, leading to 8–12% stockout rates
      on fast movers and excess on slow movers.
    - >-
      Perishables with short shelf life require precise ordering; many retailers
      see 2–5% of sales lost to shrink/spoilage in fresh categories.
    - >-
      Vendor constraints (case packs, minimums, cut-off times, multi-day lead
      times) are hard to optimize simultaneously, resulting in overstock or
      missed vendor windows.
    - >-
      Store managers override centralized orders without feedback loops;
      learnings are not captured, so performance doesn’t improve over time.
    - >-
      Small IT teams and budget limit adoption of enterprise solutions;
      integration and setup complexity is a major barrier.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve POS integration to ingest 12–24 months of sales, returns, and
      inventory by SKU/store; automated SKU-to-vendor mapping and catalog
      normalization.
    - >-
      ML forecasting at SKU x store x day/week with exogenous variables
      (temperature, precipitation, holidays, school calendars, local events,
      promos, price changes).
    - >-
      Inventory and ordering policy optimization that enforces case packs, MOQs,
      safety stock targets, shelf life, delivery calendars, and lead times per
      vendor.
    - >-
      Auto-generated purchase orders by vendor and store with explainability
      (drivers: weather, promo uplift, trend) and one-click approve/push to
      EDI/email.
    - >-
      Perishables-aware reorder logic and dynamic safety stocks to balance
      service level and waste; “what-if” scenario planning for promos and price
      changes.
    - >-
      Feedback loop that learns from user overrides and realized sales to reduce
      bias over time; weekly KPI reporting on accuracy, waste, and service
      levels.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut stockouts and shrink while saving buyer time: plug in your POS and get
    SKU-level forecasts and auto-generated POs that respect vendor lead times,
    case packs, and shelf life—optimized for specialty food volatility
    (seasonality, weather, promos, and local events).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized models and constraints for specialty food (perishables, case
    packs, vendor calendars) plus a growing, privacy-preserving data network
    across similar retailers that improves forecasts and promo uplift estimates.
    Low-friction POS integrations and prebuilt vendor catalogs enable go-live in
    days, not months, and a feedback loop learns from overrides to continuously
    reduce bias.
