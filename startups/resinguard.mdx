  problem:
    - >-
      Compounders buying base resins face high variability from suppliers and
      additives; manual SPC in spreadsheets misses slow drifts (e.g., MFI creep
      from moisture, color ΔE drift from masterbatch variability).
    - >-
      Lab and process data are siloed across instruments and systems (MFI
      extruders, UTM/Izod testers, DSC, spectrophotometers, LIMS, MES), causing
      delayed detection (hours to days) of out-of-control or out-of-spec events.
    - >-
      Existing SPC modules are generic; they don’t encode plastics-specific
      behaviors (e.g., MFI vs. drying temp/time, DSC Tg/Tm signatures linked to
      over-shearing) or provide actionable CAPA starting points.
    - >-
      Quality teams spend excessive time building charts, transcribing results,
      and writing CAPAs for audits (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, ISO 17025) rather than
      preventing issues.
    - >-
      Late detections lead to scrap, rework, line downtime, and customer
      returns/chargebacks; typical scrap 1–3% with 0.3–1.0 pp attributable to
      late anomaly detection.
    - >-
      Audits and customer PPAPs demand traceable quality histories with
      e-signatures; gaps in audit trails and CAPA evidence risk nonconformances.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge gateway ingests instrument data (MFI, tensile/Izod, DSC, color
      ΔE/L*a*b*, moisture, melt temp/pressure) and process signals
      (OPC-UA/Modbus) into a secure cloud data lake.
    - >-
      AI+SPC engine: I-MR, X̄-R, EWMA charts with Western Electric rules;
      change-point detection; isolation forest for multivariate anomalies; trend
      forecasting for drift (e.g., MFI vs. dryer conditions).
    - >-
      Plastics-specific models and rules library (e.g., color drift due to
      masterbatch lot changes, DSC crystallinity deviations linked to cooling
      profiles).
    - >-
      Auto-generated CAPA templates aligned to 8D with pre-filled defect
      descriptions, suspected causes, containment actions, and data-backed
      verification steps.
    - >-
      Supplier lot traceability and scorecards linking incoming COA/COQ to lab
      results and downstream quality outcomes.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit readiness: complete e-signature/audit trail, version
      control, sampling plans, PPAP-ready reports.
    - >-
      Real-time alerting to email/SMS/MS Teams/Slack with severity, probable
      root cause, and recommended actions.
    - >-
      Dashboards for Quality/Operations: Cp/Cpk, OOS/OOC rates, first-pass
      yield, MTBF/MTTR, instrument status, and audit KPIs.
    - >-
      MSA (Gage R&R), calibration reminders, and instrument health monitoring to
      reduce measurement variation.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to LIMS/MES/ERP (LabVantage/LabWare/STARLIMS,
      Rockwell, Siemens, SAP).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Plastics-specific AI SPC that unifies lab and process data, detects drifts
    and out-of-control points in minutes, and auto-generates audit-ready
    8D/5-Why CAPAs—reducing scrap and rework by 0.3–1.0 percentage points per
    plant and cutting CAPA closure time by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep plastics-compounding domain library (MFI/color/DSC-specific rules),
    prebuilt instrument connectors, and automated 8D CAPA generation tied to
    real-time SPC—enabling faster time-to-value and audit-ready evidence that
    generic SPC/LIMS tools lack.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality, lab, and process leaders at custom resin compounders who must keep
    every lot in spec despite supplier variability and tight customer
    tolerances.
  problem: >-
    External: variable incoming resin and process drift push MFI, tensile, Izod,
    DSC, and color out of control. Internal: manual SPC, siloed data, and late
    lab reads create blind spots and stress. Philosophical: quality data should
    prevent defects, not just document them. Villain: spreadsheet charts that
    miss subtle trends.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we have managed compounding labs and audits and know the pressure
    to catch issues early. Authority: built by QA/process engineers and data
    scientists; proven SPC rules (Western Electric/Nelson) plus anomaly
    detection; secure LIMS/ERP/historian integrations; production-hardened.
  plan: >-
    Simple plan: 1) Connect lab and process data sources. 2) Auto-baseline and
    configure control charts, limits, and alert policies for MFI, tensile, Izod,
    DSC, color. 3) Pilot on one line, then go live with dashboards and
    auto-generated CAPA templates. Risk reversal: no rip-and-replace,
    month-to-month pilot, SOC 2 and RBAC, you own your data.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30-minute demo and data assessment; start a 30-day pilot.
    Transitional: download a sample SPC/CAPA pack, alert policy checklist, and
    ROI model.
  success: >-
    Proactive detection of drift and out-of-control points; faster CAPAs with
    pre-filled 8D templates; lower scrap and rework; higher Cpk and first-pass
    yield; fewer customer complaints and chargebacks; audit-ready traceability
    and confident teams.
  failure: >-
    Staying with manual charts and delayed feedback means missed trends,
    quarantined lots, firefighting, wasted resin, failed audits, and lost
    business.
