  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators and programmers spend 1–3 hours per RFQ building draft nests
      just to estimate material usage and machine time.
    - >-
      Material utilization is typically 70–85% on mixed-part jobs; 2–6% scrap
      reduction is routinely left on the table due to time constraints and
      manual nesting rules.
    - >-
      Runtime estimates from default CAM settings are often off by 10–30%,
      creating schedule misses, overtime, and WIP build‑up.
    - >-
      Remnant management is ad hoc; remnants are underused or scrapped due to
      poor visibility and no fast remnant-fit optimizers.
    - >-
      Incumbent CAD/CAM nesting tools are powerful but license‑heavy, slow to
      set up for quick quoting, and often locked to specific machines; not ideal
      for pre‑plan scenarios.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size shops lack data science resources to calibrate runtime
      models to their actual machines, pierce times, micro-joint policies, and
      assist-gas parameters.
    - >-
      Sales cycles are lost when quotes take >24 hours; competitors with
      automated estimates win more jobs, especially in low-mix/high-volume
      sectors.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud and on‑prem AI engine that ingests part geometry (DXF/DWG/STEP),
      BOMs, thickness/material, and order quantities to auto‑create draft nests
      respecting constraints (grain direction, common-line cutting,
      micro-joints, keep-outs).
    - >-
      Calibrated runtime prediction per machine using historical cut data (feed
      rates, pierce counts, lead‑ins) to achieve <8% MAE on cycle time within 2
      weeks of learning.
    - >-
      Remnant optimizer: automatically suggests best-fit remnants and maintains
      a live remnant catalog; predicts when a remnant will likely be usable
      again.
    - >-
      Rapid quoting workbench: batch multiple RFQs, return material usage %,
      runtime, gas usage, and cost rollups in <5 minutes for 100–500 part mixes.
    - >-
      One‑click export of nest layouts (DXF/DWG) and CSV/JSON of
      runtime/material to existing CAM (SigmaNEST, Lantek, RADAN, BySoft,
      TruTops, ProNest) and ERP (JobBOSS, E2, Epicor).
    - >-
      Constraint templates per customer/machine (e.g., part priority, no-scratch
      zones, tabbing rules) for repeatable estimates.
    - >-
      Closed-loop feedback: compare predicted vs actuals from ERP/MES;
      auto‑recalibrate runtime and utilization rules weekly.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate accurate draft nests, material utilization, and calibrated
    runtime/cost estimates in minutes—before programming—so shops quote faster,
    win more jobs, and reduce scrap by 2–6% with no CAM switch or machine
    lock‑in.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop calibration using each shop’s actual cut data yields fast,
    shop‑specific accuracy without heavy configuration; growing proprietary
    dataset across materials/machines creates a data moat. Drop‑in connectors to
    leading CAM/ERP reduce switching costs and time‑to‑value to days, not
    months.
  customerSegments:

    Operations planners and estimators at sheet‑metal job shops and OEM fab
    cells who must quote and schedule laser/punch work profitably.
  problem: >-
    They spend hours trial‑nesting, guess at machine runtimes, and lose margin
    to scrap—causing quote anxiety, schedule slips, and unpredictable costs.
    Smart shops shouldn’t have to gamble on estimates.
  guide: >-
    Nesting Pre‑Plan and Material Utilization is your AI co‑planner for laser
    and punch, trained on thousands of nests and built to speak your CAD/CAM and
    ERP—so you can trust the plan before you cut.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload parts/BOM with material, grain, and machine rules. 2) Get draft
    nests with utilization and machine‑specific runtime estimates. 3)
    Approve/adjust and export to CAM/ERP or automate via API.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot with your last two weeks of jobs, or connect the API to
    auto‑preplan new work.
  success: >-
    Minutes‑not‑hours pre‑planning, higher material utilization, dependable
    runtimes for accurate quotes and schedules, smoother laser/punch flow, and
    healthier margins.
  failure: >-
    Keep overbuying material, missing promise dates, underquoting jobs, and
    idling machines while programmers wrestle with nests.
