leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High idle time and queuing at loaders and dumps cause 5–15% productivity
      losses per shift at construction sand and gravel pits.
    - >-
      Dispatching is largely manual (radio + spreadsheets), making it hard to
      hit hourly tonnage targets when haul road conditions, weather, or staffing
      change mid-shift.
    - >-
      Mismatched loader–truck assignments and suboptimal routes increase fuel
      burn by 5–10% and accelerate equipment wear.
    - >-
      Limited site connectivity and fragmented data (telematics, scale house,
      maintenance logs) prevent data-driven adjustments during the shift.
    - >-
      Overtime and missed customer delivery windows increase costs and erode
      margins in tight-competition markets.
  solution:
    - >-
      Pre-shift plan: Optimize loader–truck assignments, staging, and initial
      haul routes to achieve hourly tonnage targets, respecting constraints
      (loader capacity, truck payload, haul road grades, cycle distances,
      HOS/shift limits).
    - >-
      In-shift dynamic rebalancing: Predict queue lengths and reassign trucks
      when bottlenecks, breakdowns, or weather affect cycle times.
    - >-
      Predictive cycle model: Fuse telematics (speed, payload, fuel, location),
      scale/weight tickets, and road condition inputs to forecast cycle times
      and tons/hr with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Operator guidance: Simple tablet/MTB interface with next task, route, and
      queue instructions; dispatcher dashboard with what-if scenarios.
    - >-
      Edge-resilient deployment: On-site edge device runs the optimizer in
      low/no connectivity; cloud sync for reporting and learning.
    - >-
      Post-shift analytics: Variance analysis vs. plan, root causes (queue,
      loader underutilization, road condition), and recommendations for road
      maintenance or staging changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase tons-per-operating-hour and reduce idle time with an AI planner
    that creates and continuously adapts loader–truck assignments and haul
    routes to meet shift tonnage targets—working reliably even with poor
    connectivity and minimal operator workflow change.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built optimizer for short-haul construction aggregate pits that
    combines physics-informed cycle simulation with learned queue dynamics, runs
    reliably at the edge with poor connectivity, and ships with pre-built
    integrations to the most common scale house, telematics, and payload
    systems—reducing time-to-value to weeks rather than quarters. Accumulated
    cross-site cycle datasets and templates for typical pit configurations
    further accelerate accuracy and deployment.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Large national and super-regional aggregate producers with owned or
      dedicated truck fleets (e.g., 10–50+ pits).
    - >-
      Mid-market independent producers with 1–10 pits and mixed fleets
      (company-owned + third-party haulers).
    - >-
      On-site production managers, dispatchers, and loader operators responsible
      for meeting hourly tonnage targets and reducing idle time.
    - >-
      Contract hauling firms serving aggregate pits that need predictable queue
      times and turnarounds to maximize billable hours.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct enterprise sales to national and super-regional producers;
      land-and-expand from 1–2 pilot pits to multi-site rollouts.
    - >-
      OEM/ISV partnerships with telematics, scale house, and payload vendors as
      referral/reseller channels.
    - >-
      Industry events and associations: NSSGA/AGG1, CONEXPO-CON/AGG, state
      aggregate associations (e.g., TACA in Texas).
    - >-
      Field marketing and demo days at customer pits with side-by-side baseline
      vs. optimized shift trials.
    - >-
      Targeted digital campaigns on LinkedIn and trade publications (Pit &
      Quarry, Rock Products), offering ROI calculators and case studies.
    - >-
      Outbound to operations leaders using region-specific datasets
      (weather/haul conditions) to estimate potential gains.
    - >-
      Customer success-driven upsell (advanced features, multi-site analytics)
      after proving ROI within 6–8 weeks.
