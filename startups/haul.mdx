  problem:
    - >-
      Unproductive queues at primary crusher, load-out, and scales add 15–40%
      non‑value time per cycle; typical haul truck idle time >30% during shift
      peaks.
    - >-
      Static or ad‑hoc dispatching can’t react to moving faces/stockpiles;
      routes remain suboptimal as conditions change, increasing average cycle
      time by 8–20%.
    - >-
      Poor truck–loader match and uneven payloads cause underutilization
      (tons/truck-hour 10–25% below benchmark) and higher cost/ton.
    - >-
      Limited visibility across mixed fleets (Cat, Komatsu, Volvo, Deere) and
      contract haulers; siloed telematics, payload, and scale data hinder
      actionable decisions.
    - >-
      Operator variability (speed choice, queue behavior) creates safety and
      efficiency issues; near-miss hotspots around intersections and ramps are
      not quantified.
    - >-
      High fuel burn and emissions intensity due to idling and inefficient
      routes; fuel/ton often 5–10% above best-in-class.
    - >-
      Connectivity constraints (pit coverage, private LTE gaps) prevent
      consistent real-time insights at many quarries.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time cycle analytics: auto-segmentation of haul cycles (load, travel
      loaded, queue, dump, travel empty, idle) from telematics and payload/scale
      data.
    - >-
      Dynamic dispatch recommendations: assign trucks to
      faces/loaders/stockpiles and route options based on predicted
      queue/congestion, loader availability, and haul profiles.
    - >-
      Haul route optimization: geofenced routes with grade, surface condition,
      and intersection risk; speed advisories and time windows for
      scale/load-out.
    - >-
      Predictive congestion and bottleneck forecasts (5–30 min horizon) using
      historical cycles, current telemetry, and shift plans.
    - >-
      Digital twin & what‑if simulation: test shift plans, equipment moves, and
      truck counts before changes go live.
    - >-
      Operator & dispatcher tools: lightweight mobile/web app; radio/announcer
      integrations; optional ruggedized in-cab prompts for recommendations.
    - >-
      KPI and cost/ton dashboards: tons/hour, queue minutes, utilization,
      fuel/ton, CO2/ton, loader wait, scale wait; A/B test reporting to prove
      impact.
    - >-
      Connectivity-aware edge mode: local buffering and on‑device inference when
      pit coverage is intermittent; syncs when back online.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce queue time 25% and lift tons per truck-hour 10–15% in under 60 days
    via AI-driven, closed-loop dispatch and haul-route optimization that works
    with your existing telematics, payload scales, and radios—no
    rip-and-replace.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dispatch specifically tuned for quarry-scale operations (not
    just large mines), powered by a growing proprietary dataset and
    out-of-the-box integrations with the most common telematics, payload, and
    scale systems—delivering measurable ROI in weeks without new hardware.
