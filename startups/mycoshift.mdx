  problem:
    - >-
      Room- and flush-level yield is highly variable and difficult to predict
      3–10 days ahead, causing either understaffed shifts (missed optimum
      picking windows and quality downgrades) or overstaffed shifts (overtime
      and idle labor).
    - >-
      Most farms rely on grower intuition and spreadsheets; forecasts are not
      updated intra-day as climate, pin counts, disease pressure, and pick rates
      change.
    - >-
      Labor is 30–50% of operating cost in mushroom production; poor forecast
      accuracy drives 5–15% overtime and increases turnover due to chaotic
      schedules.
    - >-
      Mismatch between harvest and sales orders leads to lower fill rates,
      last-minute contract buys, and shrink (unsold or downgraded product),
      typically 3–8% of weekly volume.
    - >-
      Data to improve forecasting exists (climate logs, flush history, pack-out
      by grade, pick rates, substrate lots) but is siloed across controllers,
      scales, ERP/WMS, and manual logs.
    - >-
      No easy way to simulate what-if scenarios (e.g., shift length, crew mix,
      climate tweaks) to balance yield, quality, and labor capacity over the
      next 7–14 days.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration pipeline: ingest climate, substrate/batch info, pin/bed
      observations (optionally via computer vision), historical pack-out by
      grade, and pick-rate/crew data.
    - >-
      Probabilistic yield models per room and flush with confidence bands;
      automatic detection of flush initiation and expected peak windows.
    - >-
      Shift-level harvest plan that translates forecasts into headcount by
      crew/line, start/stop times, and targeted rooms/rows, with constraints for
      labor laws and skill mix.
    - >-
      Demand alignment: reconcile forecasted yields with confirmed orders by
      SKU/grade; prioritize picks to maximize margin and fill rate; suggest
      trade-offs (e.g., pack mix shifts).
    - >-
      What-if simulation: test changes to setpoints, shift length, crew size, or
      room sequencing and see yield/labor impact over 3–14 days.
    - >-
      Alerts and exceptions: flag rooms at risk of missing peak, disease/quality
      risk indicators, and forecast drift; recommend corrective actions.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to climate systems, scales/packhouse, WMS/ERP, and
      workforce management tools; mobile interface for crew leaders to receive
      pick plans and report progress.
    - >-
      Onboarding and calibration service: 4–8 weeks to baseline models; weekly
      performance reviews and continuous improvement playbooks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Flush- and room-level yield forecasts that update hourly and convert into
    shift-by-shift harvest and labor plans. Achieve 3-day forecasts within 5–8%
    MAPE and 7-day forecasts within 8–12% MAPE after 6–8 weeks of calibration;
    reduce overtime 10–20%, improve yield capture 1–2%, and raise order fill
    rate 3–5%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously growing, cross-producer flush-level dataset and feature
    library specific to mushrooms, combined with an optimization engine tuned to
    labor realities in mushroom houses. Feedback loops from pick-rate and mobile
    plan adherence create site-specific learning curves that generic analytics
    or spreadsheets cannot replicate.
  customerSegments:

      specialty) with 50–500 grow rooms or tunnels, 5–50+ million lb/year.
