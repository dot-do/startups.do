leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers ingest messy, inconsistent ONIX (2.1/3.0) and mixed sources; up
      to 20–40% of records have missing/incorrect fields (series, edition, age
      range, format, contributors).
    - >-
      Misclassification of BISAC/Thema categories drives poor search facets and
      shelving; long-tail titles get buried online and mis-shelved in-store,
      increasing returns.
    - >-
      Keywords and blurbs are often publisher-oriented (not
      retailer/conversion-oriented), leading to low onsite search CTR and weak
      PDP conversion.
    - >-
      Manual metadata fixes consume merchandiser time (often 5–15 minutes/title)
      and don’t scale during seasonal spikes or new release floods.
    - >-
      Retailers lack closed-loop measurement tying metadata changes to search,
      browse, and conversion outcomes; optimization is guesswork.
    - >-
      Magazine/news dealers have high SKU churn with weak category mapping and
      sparse copy, causing frequent “no result” queries and poor
      discoverability.
    - >-
      Legacy tools validate ONIX syntax but do not enrich, rewrite, or optimize
      content for retailer-specific taxonomies and SEO.
    - >-
      Crosswalks (BISAC↔Thema/BIC/Google Product Category) and region/pricing
      metadata are brittle, causing channel-specific errors and compliance
      issues.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ONIX ingestion, normalization, and deduplication across ONIX
      2.1/3.0 and CSV/XML/JSON feeds.
    - >-
      ML classification maps titles to BISAC/Thema/BIC and retailer-specific
      shelf/aisle taxonomies with confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop
      review.
    - >-
      AI-generated keyword sets and SEO-optimized blurbs tuned to retailer tone,
      avoiding compliance violations and duplicates.
    - >-
      Title/series/volume/edition parsing and normalization; contributor
      authority resolution (author/translator/editor), age/graduation level
      extraction, format/binding mapping.
    - >-
      Crosswalk engine: BISAC↔Thema↔BIC↔Google Product Category; regional
      price/availability normalization; cover image QC and alt text generation.
    - >-
      Closed-loop optimization: A/B test metadata variants via API; measure
      impact on search CTR, add-to-cart, and returns; auto-promote winners.
    - >-
      Retailer-specific export profiles and connectors (Shopify, Magento,
      Salesforce Commerce Cloud, IndieCommerce, Algolia/Elastic, custom
      SFTP/API) with schedule and delta updates.
    - >-
      Dashboard with quality scores, gap analysis, and ROI reporting; bulk batch
      cleanup and continuous enrichment modes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy ONIX and product copy into conversion-ready, retailer-specific
    metadata in hours, not months—lifting search CTR 10–25% and onsite
    conversion 3–8% while cutting manual fixes by 50%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop optimization trained on cross-retailer conversion data and
    onsite search signals, combined with deep standards expertise
    (ONIX/Thema/BISAC) and retailer-specific taxonomy mappings. The system not
    only validates and enriches but proves ROI via built-in A/B testing and
    attribution, creating a data moat and feedback loop competitors lack.

    1) Connect your ONIX/API/SFTP feed. 2) We audit, fix, and enrich; you review
    and approve in a simple dashboard. 3) Publish to POS/ecommerce/marketplaces
    and monitor uplift via a metadata scorecard.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 30-day pilot on your live catalog. Transitional: Request a
    free sample audit and metadata scorecard on a subset of titles.
  success: >-
    Clean, consistent, retailer-ready metadata; better search ranking and
