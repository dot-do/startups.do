  problem:
    - >-
      Treating plants spend 40–120 hours per audit assembling binders from
      scattered systems (SCADA/retort logs, LIMS assays, chemical CoAs/SDS,
      training and calibration records).
    - >-
      Manual dossier assembly leads to missing or inconsistent evidence (e.g.,
      retention assays, sampling frequency logs, calibration certificates),
      causing minor/major nonconformities and re-audits.
    - >-
      Compliance requirements change (AWPA revisions, EN 351/599 updates);
      plants struggle to keep templates current across multiple sites.
    - >-
      Corrective actions are tracked in spreadsheets or emails, resulting in
      poor closure discipline and repeat findings.
    - >-
      Auditors and customers increasingly expect digital, traceable evidence and
      CAPA workflows; most plants lack a secure, shareable portal.
    - >-
      Existing QMS/EDMS tools are generic, expensive to configure for wood
      preservation, and require long implementations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion: connectors for SCADA/retort logs, LIMS assay
      data, weigh-scale and chemical mixing logs, supplier CoAs/SDS, training
      and calibration records, and ERP (SAP, MS Dynamics) exports; OCR for PDFs
      and scanned forms.
    - >-
      Standards-mapped dossier builder: generates structured, audit-ready
      binders aligned to AWPA (e.g., U1, relevant M/T series) and EN 351/EN
      599/EN 335, plus FPC and customer-specific checklists; instant PDF/ZIP
      export with table of contents and cross-references.
    - >-
      Gap analysis engine: rules + ML to detect missing/expired documents,
      sampling frequency deviations, out-of-spec retention/penetration trends,
      and chain-of-custody gaps; severity ranking and remediation guidance
      linked to clause references.
    - >-
      Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) workflows: assign owners, due
      dates, and 5-Why/8D templates; auto-reminders; evidence linking; audit
      trail with e-signatures.
    - >-
      Compliance calendar and alerts: sampling schedules, equipment calibration
      and preventative maintenance due dates, SDS renewals, training refreshers,
      and standard revision alerts.
    - >-
      Auditor/partner portal: secure, read-only access with redactions, version
      control, and immutable timestamps; optional temporary offline packages for
      field audits.
    - >-
      Analytics and KPI dashboards: dossier completeness score,
      time-to-audit-readiness, nonconformity rates, CAPA cycle time, and cost of
      poor quality reductions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, audit-ready compliance dossiers for AWPA and EN standards
    assembled automatically from your production and QC data—complete with gap
    analysis and corrective-action tracking—cutting audit prep time by 70–85%
    and reducing nonconformities by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Standards-mapped compliance ontology and pre-validated auditor templates
    tailored to treating operations, plus certified connectors with common
