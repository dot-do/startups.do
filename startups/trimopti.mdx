  problem:
    - >-
      Finish carpenters typically experience 10–20% material waste on mouldings
      (base/crown/casing) due to suboptimal stick selection and on-site changes.
    - >-
      Estimators spend 1–3 hours per job assembling takeoffs and cut lists,
      often in spreadsheets that don’t account for kerf, miters, copes, defect
      removal, and stock availability.
    - >-
      Crews lose 30–60 minutes per day sorting parts and reconciling mislabeled
      cuts, leading to rework and sequencing errors.
    - >-
      Purchase orders don’t reflect optimized stick lengths or supplier
      inventory, causing overbuying, returns, and delivery delays.
    - >-
      No trade-specific tool ties optimized cut plans to field-ready labels and
      room/location mapping; generic cabinet/cutting tools don’t fit trim
      workflows.
    - >-
      Contractors lack visibility into true scrap rate, cost per LF installed,
      and savings opportunities across projects and crews.
  solution:
    - >-
      Input runs by room/profile (or import from CSV/PlanSwift/STACK); specify
      stock length options, prices, and supplier availability.
    - >-
      AI optimizer (cost- and yield-aware) generates stick selections and cut
      maps that account for kerf, miter/cope allowances, trim ends, and defect
      skip lengths.
    - >-
      Auto-generate printable labels with QR/barcode linking each cut to
      job/room/wall/opening and cut sequence; support batch printing by
      room/crew/day.
    - >-
      Create purchase list with exact quantities by length/profile/SKU; export
      as PO to connected lumberyards or as PDF/CSV.
    - >-
      On-site re-optimization: handle change orders or damage by re-running
      optimization from mobile to consume existing offcuts first.
    - >-
      Post-job analytics: scrap rate, yield by profile, cost avoided, estimator
      vs. actual variance; benchmarks by crew and project type.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce trim waste and purchase cost by 8–15% and save 2–4 crew-hours per
    week with AI-optimized cut maps, room/location labels, and one-click,
    supplier-ready purchase orders tailored to moulding profiles and real stock
    lengths.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset linking planned cuts to field scans and actual scrap
    across thousands of trim jobs, combined with supplier stock/pricing
    integrations—enabling continuously improving optimization and cost-aware
    stick selection that competitors without field telemetry or yard
    partnerships cannot match.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Finish carpentry contractors, foremen, and small shops who want to turn room
    runs and available stock lengths into optimized cut maps, labels, and a
    purchase list for base, crown, and casing—so they waste less and install
    faster.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual cut planning across mixed profiles and stock lengths
    causes waste, re-cuts, and over-ordering.

    - Internal: Frustrated by blown margins, time lost labeling, and crew
    confusion on site.

    - Philosophical: Wood, time, and craftsmanship shouldn’t be wasted.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve run trim crews and know the pressure of tight schedules and
    expensive material.

    - Authority: Built with finish carpenters and estimators; field-tested;
    typically reduces waste 8–15% and planning time 50–70%.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload room runs, profiles, stock lengths, and constraints (kerf, miter
    loss, min offcuts).

    2) AI produces optimized cut maps, location-specific labels, and a
    consolidated purchase list.

    3) Print or share to crews/suppliers, adjust if needed, and lock the plan.

  problem:
    - Hand‑calculating cut lists burns hours and still leaves piles of offcuts.
    - Mixed stock lengths make buying guesswork and overspend common.
