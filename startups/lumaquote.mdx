leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High RFQ volume with inconsistent formats (PDFs, spreadsheets, emails)
      requires 1–3 hours of manual effort per RFQ for parsing, mapping, pricing,
      and submittals.
    - >-
      Manual SKU/option mapping is error-prone, leading to misquotes, rework,
      margin leakage, and delayed responses that reduce win rates.
    - >-
      Pricing and approvals are siloed (Excel, ERP, CPQ, email), slowing cycle
      time and complicating audit/compliance.
    - >-
      Submittal packages (cut sheets, IES, UL/DLC compliance docs) are manually
      assembled and frequently out-of-date.
    - >-
      Current tools (ERP/CPQ, rep systems, spreadsheets) do not natively parse
      RFQs or handle lighting-specific equivalencies and configuration rules.
    - >-
      Manufacturers struggle to scale quoting without adding headcount; quote
      backlogs cause rep dissatisfaction and lost opportunities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from email, portals, PDFs, and spreadsheets; extract line
      items, specs, alternates, and terms.
    - >-
      Map requirements to manufacturer SKUs/options using a lighting-specific
      product graph and rules engine (power, lumen packages, CCT, optics,
      drivers, controls, finishes, accessories).
    - >-
      Auto-price with margin guardrails and customer-specific agreements; route
      for approvals by exception.
    - >-
      Assemble branded quotes and submittal packages (cut sheets, IES files,
      UL/DLC/Energy Star docs) with version control.
    - >-
      Integrate with ERP/CPQ/CRM (SAP, Oracle, Infor, Epicor, NetSuite,
      Salesforce) and rep systems (e.g., OASIS) for one-click order conversion.
    - >-
      Continuous learning loop improves parsing, mapping accuracy, and pricing
      recommendations from outcomes and reviewer feedback.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI autopilot that turns messy lighting RFQs into priced, approved quotes and
    complete submittal packages in minutes—cutting time-to-quote by 60–80%,
    reducing errors, protecting margins, and freeing teams to win more projects.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained AI with a lighting-specific product knowledge graph and
    equivalency rules, reinforced by proprietary annotated RFQ data and
    closed-loop learning from quote outcomes—plus prebuilt ERP/rep connectors
    that shorten time-to-value and raise switching costs.
