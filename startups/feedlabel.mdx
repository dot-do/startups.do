leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Complex, shifting regulations across jurisdictions: AAFCO/FDA (21 CFR 501;
      medicated feed CFR 558; VFD) in the US and EU rules (Reg. 767/2009,
      1831/2003) plus FEDIAF guidance for pet-related claims. Teams struggle to
      keep labels and claims compliant across SKUs and markets.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone workflows: Ingredient statements ordered by
      pre-processing weight, guaranteed analysis, directions for use, warnings
      (e.g., ionophores/horse toxicity), and additive declarations are assembled
      by hand in Word/Excel, causing delays and mistakes.
    - >-
      Costly compliance failures: Mislabeling triggers stop-sales, warning
      letters, product withdrawals/recalls, relabeling waste, and retailer
      penalties. Small mills lack in-house legal/regulatory expertise.
    - >-
      Slow time-to-market: Regulatory review is a bottleneck for launching new
      or reformulated SKUs and meeting private-label deadlines.
    - >-
      Poor audit readiness: Limited version control, missing
      rationale/citations, and weak traceability impede regulatory inspections
      and customer audits.
    - >-
      Globalization pressure: Exporters need synchronized US/EU labels
      (terminology, languages, additive and claim differences); translations add
      risk and cost.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven rule and label engine: Convert formulations and intended use
      into complete label content (product name, species/category, guaranteed
      analysis, ingredient statement, directions, cautions, net quantity,
      manufacturer/distributor statements) aligned to AAFCO/FDA or EU
      requirements.
    - >-
      Automated claims and warning checker: Validate marketing claims (e.g.,
      antibiotic-free, natural, GMO-related, performance claims) and trigger
      jurisdiction-specific warnings (e.g., medicated/VFD statements, ionophore
      species cautions) with cited sources.
    - >-
      Cross-jurisdiction generator: US and EU templates with member-state
      language packs; feed additive (E-number) and functional category labeling
      support.
    - >-
      Explainable compliance: Each field annotated with rule citations and
      rationale; side-by-side change impact analysis when formulas or rules
      update.
    - >-
      Bulk recheck and alerts: Re-validate entire SKU portfolios when
      regulations change; alert on affected statements and provide one-click
      updates.
    - >-
      Workflow and audit trail: Roles, approvals, versioning, compare, redlines,
      e-signatures; export to printer-ready panel layouts and APIs to downstream
      systems.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate compliant AAFCO/EU labels, ingredient statements, and claims in
    minutes—not weeks—with explainable citations, automated warnings, and
    seamless formulation/PLM integration, reducing review time by 70%+ and label
    errors by 80–90%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, explainable regulatory rules engine trained on
    feed-specific labels and enforcement histories, combined with ex-regulator
    advisory relationships and deep integrations with leading formulation
    systems—creating switching costs via embedded workflows, audit-ready
    citations, and benchmarked accuracy not easily replicated by generic
    labeling tools.

    Regulatory, QA, and product managers at Other Animal Food manufacturers
    (NAICS 311119) who want to ship compliant labels and claims across the US
    and EU without delays.
  problem: >-
    Shifting AAFCO and EU (FEDIAF) rules make label copy, ingredient statements,
    claims, and warnings hard to get right. Manual reviews are slow and
    error-prone, risking misbranding, holds, costly reprints, and lost shelf
    time.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to launch fast and stay compliant. Our AI is
    trained on AAFCO and EU guidance and validated by regulatory experts,
    providing explainable checks and audit-ready evidence you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload formula, species, target markets, and claim goals. 2) Generate
    compliant label elements: ingredient statement order, guaranteed analysis,
    claims and warning validations, and region-specific language. 3) Review
    flags, accept fixes, and export print-ready text plus a compliance dossier;
    enable monitoring for rule updates.
  callToAction: 'Start a free compliance check now, or book a 20-minute demo.'
  success: >-
    Right-first-time labels, defensible claims and warnings, audit-ready
    documentation, fewer distributor rejections, reduced risk and rework, and
    faster expansion across US and EU.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you face label holds, reprints, fines, product withdrawals,
    rejected shipments, and damaged customer and regulator trust.
