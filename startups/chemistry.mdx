leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap variability and uncertain element recoveries cause frequent off-spec
      heats, reblends, and costly downgrades.
    - >-
      Operators use static spreadsheets and rules-of-thumb that ignore
      uncertainty (OES error, recovery scatter, oxidation/burn-off), leading to
      over-additions (e.g., Mg, Sr) and margin loss.
    - >-
      Time-to-decision is slow; every resample adds 5–15 minutes per heat,
      hurting furnace throughput and energy efficiency.
    - >-
      Hitting narrow spec windows (automotive, aerospace) while minimizing cost
      is difficult when tramp elements (Fe, Zn, Pb) approach limits and can only
      be corrected by dilution.
    - >-
      Material choices are constrained by inventory, master alloy availability,
      and returns; most tools don’t optimize with real-time costs and stock
      constraints.
    - >-
      Lack of traceability and auditability for chemistry corrections risks
      customer claims and nonconformance (e.g., IATF 16949/ISO 9001).
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time optimizer that ingests OES sample, bath mass/temperature,
      inventory, and live material prices; outputs precise kg
      additions/dilutions for pure Al, elements, master alloys (e.g., AlTi5B1,
      AlSr10, AlMn20), Si metal, Mg ingot, and shop returns.
    - >-
      Robust optimization under uncertainty: models OES measurement error,
      volatilization/burn-off (e.g., Mg fade), and recovery distributions by
      alloy-furnace-condition to minimize cost and overshoot risk
      simultaneously.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware planning: respects max/min composition limits, tramp
      element ceilings (Fe, Zn, Pb, Sn), melt practice rules (e.g., no Sr before
      degassing), and inventory/charge limits.
    - >-
      Adaptive learning: per-alloy, per-furnace recovery factors and bias
      corrections updated automatically from actuals vs. targets; continuous
      improvement of first-hit rate.
    - >-
      Workflow guidance: stepwise addition sequencing, stir/soak time, resample
      timing, and visual operator checklist; triggers early dilution or heat
      segregation if uncorrectable (e.g., Fe too high).
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: simulate alternative material mixes (pure vs. master
      alloy vs. returns) and cost/risk trade-offs before committing.
    - >-
      Integrations: OES/LIMS, ERP/MES (inventory, costs), historian; edge device
      for low-latency and offline operation with cloud sync.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability: immutable audit trail of decisions, who
      executed what and when; spec library with customer-specific windows and
      mid-point targeting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    First-time-in-spec chemistry, at lowest cost and risk, in seconds.
    AI-optimized addition and dilution plans that learn your furnace’s true
    recoveries and respect your inventory, specs, and safety rules—cutting
    reblends, alloy spend, and cycle time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Plant-calibrated stochastic recovery models and uncertainty-aware
    optimization trained on proprietary multi-plant datasets, embedded directly
    into operator workflows via OES/ERP integrations and validated
    rulebooks—difficult for spreadsheet or generic AI vendors to replicate.

    Melt shop supervisors, process engineers, and furnace operators at secondary
    aluminum smelters/alloyers who must hit tight chemistry specs on time at the
    lowest cost.
  problem: >-
    Scrap variability and tight specs force guesswork between pure, master
    alloys, and returns; OES drift, time pressure, and volatile alloy costs
    trigger re-melts, over-alloying, yield loss, and late shipments.
  guide: >-
    Chemistry Correction Advisor (In-Process)—an AI built by
    metallurgists—understands melt-shop realities and delivers auditable,
    data-backed recommendations integrated with your OES and inventory.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect OES data and inventory/costs. 2) For each sample, CCA computes
    least-cost, low-risk additions/dilutions (pure, master alloys, returns) with
    uncertainty margins. 3) Apply actions, auto-log results, and continuously
    improve via feedback.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo and pilot on one furnace; connect your OES, run one
    shift with guided corrections, then review a savings and hit-rate report.
  success: >-
    Hit spec the first time, lower metal cost per ton, fewer re-melts, faster
    tap-to-tap, predictable certs, confident operators, and a traceable recipe
    history customers trust.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing, over-alloying, and re-melting—burning time and yield, missing
    ship dates, and risking claims and COA rejections.

  problem:
    - Spec hits are inconsistent with variable scrap and tight windows.
    - Over‑alloying to be safe drives up metal cost and dross.
    - Re‑melts and delays when heats miss chemistry targets.
    - Spreadsheets can’t handle multi‑element constraints or recoveries.
    - 'Decisions depend on operator guesswork, not plant rules.'
    - 'Plans ignore real inventory, returns, and current costs.'
    - No clear audit trail of why additions were made.
  solution:
    - Convert any OES sample into exact additions/dilutions to hit spec.
    - 'Optimizes cost and risk; selects pure, master alloys, and returns.'
    - 'Accounts for recovery, burn‑off, and yield by furnace and element.'
    - Locks to impurity caps and customer specs automatically.
    - Real‑time guidance with re‑sample/auto‑adjust loop.
