leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Forecast accuracy at weekly SKU level is poor (typical WMAPE 22–35% for
      long-tail SKUs), causing stockouts on promotions and overstocks
      post-event.
    - >-
      Promo lift is misestimated due to mixed mechanics (BOGO, TPR, display,
      feature) and retailer-specific effects, leading to 5–15% OTIF penalties
      and wasted trade spend.
    - >-
      S&OP and production plans are built on monthly/aggregate demand, not
      SKU-week/DC, creating capacity misalignment (e.g., fryer/packaging
      changeovers) and excess safety stock.
    - >-
      Retailer replenishment requires granular, timely forecasts and promo
      scenarios; existing tools lack fast scenario runs and store/DC-level
      normalization.
    - >-
      New product intros and limited-time offers lack reliable analog-based
      demand, causing lost sales in first 4–8 weeks.
    - >-
      Data is siloed (ERP shipments, syndicated POS, trade calendar, price/pack,
      DSD data) with manual Excel adjustments and no FVA visibility.
  solution:
    - >-
      Verticalized, causal demand forecasting engine producing weekly SKU
      forecasts (optionally by DC/retailer cluster) with hierarchical
      reconciliation.
    - >-
      Promo lift modeling that decomposes effects of price depth, feature,
      display, seasonality, cannibalization, and halo using causal ML and
      Bayesian techniques.
    - >-
      Fast scenario planning—simulate multiple promo calendars (depth, timing,
      distribution, display) and see lift, volume, service level, and capacity
      impacts within minutes.
    - >-
      NPI/innovation forecasting via analog selection, text/image product
      attribute embeddings, and early POS signal assimilation.
    - >-
      Integrated outputs for S&OP, production scheduling, and retailer
      replenishment: API feeds, flat files, and native connectors.
    - >-
      Bias control and forecast value add measurement with planner override
      workflows and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    SKU-week accurate forecasts and promo lift scenarios purpose-built for
    snacks, delivered in hours not weeks, integrated to S&OP, production, and
    retailer replenishment—reducing WMAPE by 20–40% vs baseline, cutting
    stockouts 10–25%, and improving promo ROI by 5–10%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical moat: snack-specific promo mechanics, retailer normalization,
    capacity translation to fryer/packaging lines, and pre-trained
    seasonality/holiday patterns. Rapid time-to-value from pre-built connectors
    and scenario engine, plus FVA governance that proves impact in 12 weeks.
    Accumulated analog libraries and elasticity catalogs improve performance
    with scale and are hard to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Mid-market Other Snack Food Manufacturers (annual revenue
      $50M–$1B) with 300–5,000 active SKUs across 5–20 retailers and 2–10 DCs.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Snack-food demand, supply, and S&OP leaders who need reliable weekly SKU
    forecasts and promo lift to align production and retailer replenishment.
  problem: >-
    Promotions, seasonality, and retailer behavior whipsaw demand; spreadsheets
    and coarse models create stockouts, overtime, and write-offs when weekly
    SKU-level accuracy is what matters.
  guide: >-
    We understand promo-driven volatility in snack categories and act as your
    forecasting partner. Our explainable AI is trained on CPG patterns, retailer
    calendars, and price/promo mechanics, integrates quickly with your systems,
    and reports accuracy transparently.
  plan: >-
    - Connect data: shipments, POS, retailer inventory, price/promo calendars,
    trade spend, SKU catalogs, constraints.

    - Calibrate models at SKU-week by channel/retailer; validate with backtests
    and MAPE/bias targets.

    - Run promo-lift scenarios and capacity-aware plans; publish forecasts to
    S&OP, production, and replenishment via API or files.

    - Review weekly with alerts and exceptions to continuously improve.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute assessment and start a 6-week pilot on a priority category
    and top retailers; request a sample accuracy report and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Lower MAPE at SKU-week, higher service levels, fewer stockouts and
    chargebacks, smoother production runs, less inventory and obsolescence, and
    confident S&OP with happier retailers.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing at promo demand, miss case-fill targets, pay chargebacks, run
    overtime, write off excess, and lose displays and shelf space to
    better-forecasting competitors.
