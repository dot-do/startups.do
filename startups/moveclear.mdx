  problem:
    - >-
      Movers and office coordinators waste 1–3 hours per job finding building
      rules, required COI language, and freight elevator procedures.
    - >-
      Incorrect or missing COIs cause last‑minute rejections by property
      management, leading to rescheduling fees, crew idle time, and bad reviews.
    - >-
      Parking permits and curb reservations are complex, city-specific, and
      time-bound; missing them results in tickets/tows or long carry distances
      and overtime.
    - >-
      Elevator/dock conflicts and uncoordinated time windows cause delays, crew
      overtime, and penalties from buildings.
    - >-
      No single source of truth: information is spread across emails, PDFs,
      portals, and phone calls; staff knowledge is tribal and non-repeatable.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered intake: parse origin/destination addresses to identify
      buildings, pull known rules, and detect likely requirements (COI
      endorsements, floor protection, time windows).
    - >-
      COI automation: pre-fill ACORD 25 and endorsements from mover’s policy;
      route to broker/insurer portals; validate wording against building
      requirements; deliver signed COI PDFs.
    - >-
      Permit automation: file city-specific moving/temporary no-parking permits;
      generate signage; track approvals and reminders for posting/printing.
    - >-
      Elevator/dock scheduling: email/portal automation to request freight
      reservations, dock access, and COI approval; calendar confirmations for
      both ends.
    - >-
      Move-day packet: a single PDF/URL with COIs, permit receipts, elevator
      confirmations, dock instructions, building contact info, and crew
      checklist.
    - >-
      Exceptions desk: human-in-the-loop ops for nonstandard buildings,
      certificate wording disputes, and complex municipal scenarios with
      SLA-backed turnaround.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One click to a compliant, confirmed move-day packet. MoveClear AI aggregates
    building rules, generates correct COIs, secures parking permits, and books
    elevators/docks—reducing prep time by 70%+, cutting COI rejections below 2%,
    and eliminating costly day-of delays.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously verified Building Rules Graph linked to insurer wording
    templates and city permit flows, plus human-in-the-loop exceptions. Each
    completed move enriches the database (network effects), driving higher
    first-pass acceptance and faster turnaround no generic competitor or manual
    workflow can match.

    A busy resident or office admin planning a move who wants building access
    handled right the first time.
  problem: >-
    - External: Every building has unique move rules, COI wording, parking
    permits, and elevator windows to navigate.

    - Internal: You worry a missed detail will block movers, trigger fines, or
    force a costly reschedule.

    - Philosophical: Moving should be about getting from A to B, not decoding
    bureaucracy.
  guide: >-
    We understand how last‑minute COIs, tow zones, and locked elevators derail
    moves. Our AI planner aggregates building policies, auto‑generates compliant
    COIs, applies for permits, and confirms elevator reservations—so you don’t
    have to.
  plan: >-

    insurance.

    Primary: Create your move‑day packet now. Secondary: View a sample packet
    and timeline.
  success: >-
    Guaranteed clarity on access, permits, and elevator slots; movers work
    continuously; no surprise fines; on‑time, lower‑stress move with one source
    of truth.
  failure: >-
    Without this, you risk denied building access, invalid COIs, no elevator
    time, parking tickets, rebooking fees, overtime, and delayed moves.
