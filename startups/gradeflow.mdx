leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High trim loss during grade transitions (typical 0.8–2.0% of production)
      due to suboptimal sequencing and ramping decisions.
    - >-
      Excess off-spec tonnage per change (often 3–15 tons/change on
      packaging/tissue machines), driven by manual ramp paths and inconsistent
      operator practices.
    - >-
      Long and variable changeover times (10–30% variance across shifts),
      causing schedule slippage and reduced OEE.
    - >-
      Manual, experience-based sequencing that doesn’t account for dynamic
      constraints (steam, stock, basis weight, moisture, headbox, chemistry) and
      downstream orders, leading to frequent rework and rush campaigns.
    - >-
      Limited ability to simulate “what-if” scenarios to choose the best next
      grade and ramp path before committing, resulting in unplanned downtime and
      quality holds.
    - >-
      Fragmented digital landscape (DCS/MES/Planner/PI Historian) with no
      dedicated AI to reconcile planning objectives with process-control
      constraints in near real time.
    - >-
      Loss of tribal knowledge as senior operators retire; ramp know-how isn’t
      codified or transferable across sites and shifts.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven sequencing optimizer (MILP/heuristic hybrid) that chooses the
      next-best grade/order considering demand, machine constraints, and
      cost-to-change.
    - >-
      Ramp planner that generates time/phases for key setpoint trajectories
      (basis weight, moisture, steam, stock blend, chemistry, calender load,
      speed) to minimize off-spec and stabilization time.
    - >-
      Digital twin/simulator for grade transitions to evaluate scenarios before
      execution; recommends the lowest cost/risk option.
    - >-
      Closed-loop or advisory control: pushes setpoints to DCS via OPC UA/DA or
      provides operator prompts with interlocks and guardrails.
    - >-
      Learning system that adapts ramp profiles by grade pair and machine
      condition (felt age, furnish mix, ambient) using historical outcomes.
    - >-
      Real-time monitoring and alarms for deviation from planned ramp, with
      automated re-optimization if disturbances occur.
    - >-
      Integrated with mill planning (trim/order book) so sequencing respects
      delivery priorities and reduces trimming waste end-to-end.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce trim loss, off-spec tonnage, and changeover time with an AI that
    jointly optimizes grade sequencing and ramp paths, plugs into your DCS/MES,
    and pays for itself in under 6 months. Vendor-agnostic, simulation-backed
    recommendations with closed-loop or advisory modes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-mill library of grade-pair ramp recipes and sequencing
    heuristics tuned by machine archetype, plus a simulator that accurately
    ranks candidate transitions. This data network effect, combined with
    vendor-agnostic closed-loop capability and a savings-backed commercial
    model, shortens time-to-value and is hard to replicate by generic APS/APC
    tools or one-off in-house scripts.
  customerSegments:
