  problem:
    - >-
      Buyers waste 4–10 hours per job logging into multiple vendor portals,
      emailing reps, and manually comparing quotes, freight, taxes, and lead
      times.
    - >-
      Missed savings: Contractors often default to habitual vendors, forgoing
      2–5% lower landed cost available elsewhere on the same spec items or
      approved equals.
    - >-
      Unreliable lead-time data and allocations cause change orders and schedule
      slips; there’s no consolidated, predictive view of stock, production, and
      transit by vendor/DC.
    - >-
      Purchase orders are drafted manually from estimates/takeoffs, causing
      errors in SKUs, over/under-ordering, and missed overage/waste factors.
    - >-
      No closed-loop analytics on vendor performance (on-time, fill rate, price
      adherence), making it hard to negotiate or adjust sourcing strategies.
    - >-
      Knowledge is siloed with senior buyers; when they’re unavailable,
      purchasing stalls and tribal knowledge is lost.
    - >-
      Approvals and audit trails are inconsistent across email/portal/phone,
      creating compliance and dispute risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Aggregate real-time and near-real-time pricing and availability from
      vendor portals, EDI, APIs, and email quotes into a normalized catalog for
      flooring SKUs.
    - >-
      Compute true landed cost per line (price tiers, discounts/rebates, freight
      lanes, fuel surcharges, taxes, drop-ship/handling) and surface the best
      option(s).
    - >-
      Predict lead times using historical fill rates, DC inventory, vendor
      production calendars, and lane transit data; flag allocation and backorder
      risks.
    - >-
      PO Recommender drafts purchase orders split across vendors when optimal,
      auto-applies overage/waste factors, phasing, and delivery addresses per
      job/area.
    - >-
      Spec-compliance engine matches approved equivalents (where allowed),
      showing cost/time trade-offs and capturing approvals for substitutions.
    - >-
      Approval workflows, audit trails, and ERP/accounting sync (RFMS, QFloors,
      Sage 100/300 CRE, QuickBooks, Procore) for seamless handoff and
      reconciliation.
    - >-
      Vendor performance analytics: on-time delivery, fill rate, price
      adherence, change rate; scorecards inform sourcing strategy and
      negotiations.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pick the best vendor by true landed cost and real lead time in seconds, then
    auto-draft spec-compliant POs from your estimate. Typical outcomes: 2–5%
    material cost savings, 50–70% faster PO cycle time, and fewer schedule slips
    from stockouts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking flooring SKUs to actual fulfillment
    performance (lead times, fill rates, price adherence) across vendors and
    regions—feeding predictive models and recommendations that generic
    procurement tools can’t match. Plus, pre-built connectors and catalog
    normalization specific to flooring give 6–12 months’ integration lead over
    new entrants, reinforced by buying group partnerships.
