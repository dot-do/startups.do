  problem:
    - >-
      Inspections often miss optimal windows due to weather and nectar flow
      variability, reducing yield and increasing swarm risk.
    - >-
      Inefficient yard routing causes excess miles, fuel spend, and technician
      idle time (typical 10–25% waste without route optimization).
    - >-
      Unstructured or incomplete logs hinder disease control (e.g., Varroa
      monitoring), queen performance tracking, and regulatory compliance.
    - >-
      Labor constraints: limited skilled inspectors must prioritize among
      hundreds/thousands of colonies with limited decision support.
    - >-
      Pollination contracts have tight service windows (e.g., almonds) that are
      hard to meet consistently across yards without data-driven scheduling.
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (spreadsheets, generic calendars, separate GPS apps)
      create double entry and data loss.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic inspection scheduler that ranks yards/hives daily using local
      weather, regional bloom/flow signals, and colony risk indicators.
    - >-
      Multi-stop route optimization that sequences yards within weather and
      access windows, accounting for vehicle capacity and service times.
    - >-
      Structured, offline-capable mobile logs with checklists (mite counts,
      queen status, brood pattern, feed, medications) and photo/voice capture.
    - >-
      Swarm and health risk scoring (e.g., forecasted swarm pressure, mite
      treatment windows) and automated alerts.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit exports (CSV/PDF) aligned to regional reporting needs
      and research protocols.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: yield per hive, inspection adherence, route
      efficiency, mortality, and contract SLA coverage.
    - >-
      Integrations: weather APIs, phenology datasets, mapping, IoT hive sensors,
      and existing hive management apps.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that turns weather, bloom, and hive health data into prioritized
    inspection routes and compliant logs—helping beekeepers complete the right
    inspections, at the right time, on the shortest routes. Target outcomes:
    10–20% reduction in inspection hours, 10–20% reduction in route miles, 5–10%
    lift in honey yield, and measurable reductions in winter losses and swarm
    events.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, hard-to-replicate dataset linking time-stamped inspections, bloom
    timing, weather, sensor telemetry, and outcomes across regions—feeding
    models that predict optimal inspection windows and swarm/treatment risks.
    Embedded into daily routing and compliance workflows with partners (IoT
    vendors, associations, brokers), creating switching costs and network
    effects.

    Start a free trial and generate your first week’s schedule—import your yards
    to see prioritized routes and checklists in minutes.
  success: >-
    Make the right visit at the right time: healthier colonies, higher yields,
    fewer miles, and structured, searchable logs for insights, traceability, and
    compliance.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing and you’ll miss flow/treatment windows, burn hours driving,
    let issues spread, and be caught without records when regulators or partners
    ask.
