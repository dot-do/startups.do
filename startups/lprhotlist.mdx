leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented LPR ecosystems: lenders/forwarders must manage multiple
      networks (e.g., DRN, MVTRAC, Rekor) with separate hotlists and alert
      tools, causing missed matches and duplicate work.
    - >-
      Slow, noisy alerts: raw OCR hits and duplicate pings overwhelm dispatch;
      median time-to-agent often 10–30 minutes with 15–30% false positives and
      poor deduplication.
    - >-
      Misdirected assignments: hits frequently go to the wrong agency or
      late-shift teams, reducing capture chance by 20–40% and creating safety
      risks.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit gaps: DPPA/GLBA/state ALPR laws require strict
      role-based access, purpose limitation, and audit trails—many workflows
      lack automated evidence packs and retention controls.
    - >-
      Limited performance visibility: lenders/agencies lack consistent metrics
      on hit quality, time-to-alert, agent acceptance times, and recovery
      conversion, hampering ROI and vendor accountability.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified hotlist publishing: single API/UI to publish/update/remove plates
      across supported LPR networks with sub-60s sync and status visibility.
    - >-
      AI-hit validation and scoring: ML filters and ranks hits using OCR
      confidence, vehicle attributes, historical sightings, proximity to known
      locations, and policy rules to reduce false positives by 50–80%.
    - >-
      Smart routing engine: rules- and ML-driven assignment to the best
      agent/shift based on territory, proximity, capacity, lender rules, and
      safety constraints; dedupes and suppresses repeat pings.
    - >-
      Multi-channel, low-latency alerts: push, SMS, in-app, webhook, and
      optional IVR with throttling, escalation, and acknowledgement workflows;
      target median alert delivery <30s from network event.
    - >-
      Closed-loop feedback: recoveries and field feedback automatically update
      models and rules; instant hotlist removal on recovery; evidence pack
      generation (time, geo, chain-of-custody).
    - >-
      Compliance-by-design: role-based access, field-of-use gating, redaction,
      configurable retention, and exportable audit trails aligned with
      DPPA/GLBA/CCPA and state ALPR statutes.
    - >-
      Insights and SLAs: dashboards and APIs for hit quality, time-to-alert,
      acceptance, recovery conversion, network/vendor performance; enforceable
      SLAs and QBRs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One pipeline to publish plates across authorized LPR networks and route only
    validated, high-confidence hits to the right agent in under 60 seconds—with
    full auditability, compliance controls, and measurable uplift in recoveries.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-network orchestration with validated partnerships, proprietary
    hit-validation/routing models trained on real recovery outcomes, and
    compliance-by-design workflows that generate auditor-ready evidence
    packs—creating a defensible feedback loop and switching costs for lenders
    and forwarders.

  character: >-
    Repossession agency owners, forwarders, and recovery managers who need every
    valid LPR hit turned into a fast, compliant recovery.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented LPR platforms, manual hotlists, and noisy alerts cause missed
    hits, slow dispatch, agent thrash, and compliance risk—when only authorized
    plates and instant routing should happen.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of overnight hits and missed handoffs. Our platform
    integrates with major LPR networks and enforces permissions, validation, and
    audit trails so you can act with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect assignments, plate lists, and agent roster. 2) We publish plates
    to authorized LPR networks and auto‑deconflict duplicates. 3) AI validates
    and scores hits, then routes the right agent instantly with full
    auditability.
  callToAction: Schedule a 20‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot on live assignments.
  success: >-
    Clean, authorized hotlists everywhere; fewer false positives; hits‑to‑hands
    in seconds; higher recovery rates; documented compliance; happier clients
    and agents.
  failure: >-
    Missed recoveries, wasted field hours on false alarms, client churn, and
    regulatory exposure from unauthorized plate distribution.
