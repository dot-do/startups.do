  problem:
    - >-
      Manual PPAP reviews are slow and inconsistent: typical review time is 1–3
      hours per pack with 1–2 rework loops, delaying SOPs and engineering
      changes.
    - >-
      Inconsistent interpretation of AIAG/CSR rules across Supplier Quality
      Engineers (SQEs) drives low first-pass acceptance rates (often 40–60%).
    - >-
      Document variability (supplier-specific templates, PDFs, scans, mixed
      Excel/Word) creates high clerical load and missed requirements.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced APQP/PPAP reviewers; tribal knowledge concentrated
      in a few SMEs increases risk and cost.
    - >-
      Errors in FMEA linkages (DFMEA → PFMEA → Control Plan) and weak MSA
      validity (e.g., GRR %SV thresholds, bias/linearity) frequently escape to
      launches.
    - >-
      CSR changes from OEMs are hard to propagate; suppliers unknowingly use
      outdated forms and criteria.
    - >-
      Audit risk: gaps in traceability and evidence for IATF/ISO audits due to
      manual, email-based processes and poor audit trails.
    - >-
      Supplier onboarding and coaching overhead is high; OEM SQEs spend 20–30%
      of time educating suppliers on basics vs. reviewing content.
    - >-
      Limited integration between PLM/QMS/ERP and PPAP artifacts causes
      duplicate data entry and version control issues.
    - >-
      Hidden cost of quality: late PPAP approvals lead to premium freight,
      launch containment, and line-down risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingestion of PPAP packs (PDF, Word, Excel, images/scans) with structure
      recognition for Forms 1–5 and common CSR templates.
    - >-
      Automated gap analysis against AIAG and configurable OEM CSR rule
      libraries; itemized findings with severity, evidence snippets, and
      remediation guidance.
    - >-
      FMEA consistency engine: checks DFMEA–PFMEA–Control Plan alignment
      (function/failure mode/cause linkage, action priority,
      detection/occurrence logic).
    - >-
      MSA validator: verifies GRR study design and results (ANOVA/Range), %Study
      Variation vs. tolerance, bias/linearity, stability, attribute agreement,
      and sample sizes.
    - >-
      Dimensional results checker: validates sample size, measurement system
      references, balloon-to-result coverage, and tolerance application;
      optional drawing-matching assist.
    - >-
      Explainable results and auto-generated supplier feedback checklist;
      one-click re-check on resubmission to shorten loops.
    - >-
      Integrations to PLM/QMS/ERP (e.g., Teamcenter, Windchill, SAP, ETQ) to
      pull part metadata/requirements and push status, with full audit trail and
      e-signature support.
    - >-
      Supplier portal/API to pre-check PPAPs before submission, reducing OEM
      review load.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SSO/SAML, role-based access, SOC 2-ready processes,
      private cloud/on-prem options for sensitive programs.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboard for cycle time, first-pass yield, common CSR
      violations, supplier scorecards, and model accuracy metrics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut PPAP review time by 60–80% and increase first-pass acceptance by 20–40%
    with an explainable AI checker that validates FMEA, Control Plans, MSA, and
    Dimensional Results against AIAG and OEM-specific CSRs—integrated,
    auditable, and tailored for heavy equipment manufacturers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific rule graph and training corpus built from thousands of
    anonymized PPAP artifacts in heavy equipment, plus configurable OEM CSR
    libraries and pre-built integrations with industry PLM/QMS systems.
    Explainable AI tuned to AIAG and OEM practices reduces audit risk—difficult
    for generic IDP/LLM tools to replicate.

  character: >-
    Supplier Quality Engineers and Plant Quality Managers at construction
    machinery OEMs and Tier-1s who need every supplier PPAP right the first
    time.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Manual, inconsistent PPAP reviews and complex CSR rules that hide
    gaps until it’s too late.

    - External: Hundreds of pages across FMEA, Control Plan, MSA, and
    Dimensional Results for multiple suppliers and tight launch gates.

    - Internal: Anxiety about missing a requirement, triggering rework,
    escalations, or line-down risk.

    - Philosophical: Quality documentation should be clear, compliant, and pass
    on the first submission—without guesswork.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know end-of-quarter PPAP waves and launch pressure make
    page-by-page checks exhausting and error-prone.

    - Authority: Built with supplier quality practitioners; aligns to AIAG PPAP
    and configurable CSR rules; designed to flag common issues (e.g., special
    characteristics flow-down, GR&R sufficiency, FMEA/Control Plan linkage,
    sample size rationale).
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan: 1) Upload your PPAP pack; 2) AI checks against AIAG/CSR and
    cross-links FMEA ↔ Control Plan ↔ MSA ↔ Dimensional Results; 3) Receive a
    prioritized gap report with fix-it guidance and evidence checklist.

    - Agreement Plan: Secure, private deployment; integrates with existing
    portals/PLM/SharePoint; keep your current templates and formats (PDF, XLSX,
    CSV).
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and start a pilot with 5 PPAPs.

    - Transitional: Download a sample gap report, a PPAP readiness checklist,
    and an ROI estimator.
  success: |-
    - First-pass PPAP approvals increase and resubmissions drop.
    - Launch dates protected; fewer expedites and emergency inspections.
    - Clear audit trail and traceability across PPAP elements.
    - Higher supplier capability and consistent CSR conformance.
    - Reduced SQE review time and lower quality cost of poor quality (COPQ).
  failure: |-
    - Costly rework loops and late approvals.
    - Missed CSR details leading to escapes or containment.
    - Line-down or launch delays and credibility hits with program teams.
    - Ongoing reviewer burnout and inconsistent quality decisions.
