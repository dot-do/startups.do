leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      LTL carriers suffer from preventable service failures (missed pickups/late
      deliveries, re-deliveries, detention, appointment misses) because
      exceptions are detected late or not triaged to the right person fast
      enough.
    - >-
      Existing tools generate floods of alerts without context; dispatchers and
      terminal supervisors triage manually, leading to long mean time to detect
      (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR).
    - >-
      LTL networks are complex (linehaul > cross-dock > P&D), with fragmented
      data across TMS events, telematics/ELD, trailer sensors, dock scans, and
      appointment systems; no single system fuses these signals to predict risk
      early and coordinate recovery actions.
    - >-
      Escalations are inconsistent and tribal-knowledge driven; playbooks aren’t
      standardized or measured, limiting continuous improvement and ROI
      visibility.
    - >-
      Shippers demand higher OTIF and real-time visibility; service misses
      trigger chargebacks, refunds on guaranteed services, and reputational
      damage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-signal exception detection: fuse EDI/API TMS events
      (pickup/linehaul/arrival/depart), ELD/GPS, trailer telematics, dock scans,
      appointment windows, consignee hours, traffic/weather to predict risk 2–12
      hours earlier than standard event alerts.
    - >-
      Risk scoring and prioritization: shipment- and route-level risk scores
      tied to revenue, SLA/guarantee, and customer tier; bubble up the 1–2% of
      loads requiring action now.
    - >-
      Automated, tiered escalations: push targeted tasks to the right role
      (driver/dispatcher/terminal supervisor/linehaul planner/customer service)
      via ELD messages, Teams/Slack, SMS/voice, or TMS task queues.
    - >-
      Playbook execution: one-click or auto-executed recovery SOPs (reschedule
      appointment, swap linehaul, redirect cross-dock, hot-shot recoveries,
      meet-and-turn, pre-advise consignee, allocate liftgate truck, assign
      lumper).
    - >-
      Closed-loop communication: auto-notify shippers/consignees via EDI
      214/API/email when risk changes; maintain audit trails with reason codes.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement analytics: measure MTTD/MTTR, prevented failures,
      false positives, per-terminal performance, and playbook ROI; feed
      learnings back to models.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop managed service (optional): 24/7 exception desk to
      handle overnight/weekend escalations with guaranteed response SLAs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict, prioritize, and resolve LTL exceptions before they become service
    failures. RelayWatch AI fuses telematics, dock/terminal events, and TMS data
    to cut MTTD to minutes, automate escalation playbooks, and measurably
    improve OTIF while lowering redeliveries, detention, and support costs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    An LTL-first closed-loop system: proprietary terminal dwell and linehaul
    risk models + a library of validated LTL recovery playbooks tied to specific
    roles and systems. Fast-start integrations with major ELD/trailer/EDI
    providers and human-in-the-loop escalation that guarantees action, creating
    a data moat of labeled exceptions and outcomes by terminal, lane, and
    consignee.
  customerSegments:

    actions (reroutes, reschedules, swaps), with weekly tuning.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo. Transitional: Request a pilot on 2–3
    terminals and an ROI baseline report.
  success: >-
