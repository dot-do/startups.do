  problem:
    - >-
      Flooring contractors miss 20–60% of inbound leads due to after-hours
      calls, jobsite work, or slow response, causing high cost-per-lead waste.
    - >-
      Unqualified leads (outside service area, tiny projects, wrong material)
      consume owner time and calendar space, lowering close rates.
    - >-
      Manual intake is inconsistent: key details (square footage, subfloor,
      stairs, removal needs, budget, timeline, photos) are often missing,
      leading to poor estimates and no-shows.
    - >-
      Many contractors lack integrated scheduling, resulting in phone tag,
      delays, and low booking rates from web forms and ads.
    - >-
      Rising lead costs (Google Ads/LSA/Angi/Thumbtack) demand faster, 24/7 lead
      handling to maintain ROI.
    - >-
      Owners struggle to measure lead funnel health (contact rate,
      qualification, booking rate, show rate, cost per booked estimate).
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel AI agent: phone, SMS, and web chat with natural,
      trade-appropriate voice/tone.
    - >-
      Flooring-specific intake: captures sqft, rooms, stairs, material type,
      removal/disposal, subfloor, site address/ZIP, timing, budget range,
      photos/videos.
    - >-
      Qualification rules: service area/ZIP whitelist, minimum project size
      ($/sqft or total), supported materials/services, schedule constraints, job
      type (install vs refinish vs repair).
    - >-
      Instant scheduling: live two-way calendar integration
      (Google/Outlook/Jobber/Housecall Pro) with buffers, travel time, tech
      assignment, and confirmation reminders.
    - >-
      Speed-to-lead automations: instant SMS/call to new form/LSA/Angi/Thumbtack
      leads; re-engagement of cold leads.
    - >-
      CRM sync: push structured intake to Jobber, Housecall Pro, Service Fusion,
      JobNimbus, or Google Sheets; dedupe by phone/email.
    - >-
      Human failover: warm transfer or voicemail escalation when needed; call
      whisper for priority leads.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: response time, contact/qualification/booking/show
      rates, CPL to CPBE, campaign attribution, missed-call recovery.
    - >-
      Compliance & trust: TCPA-consent workflows, call recording with
      disclosure, data retention controls, multilingual (EN/ES).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    24/7 AI that answers calls, texts, and web chats in seconds, qualifies by
    flooring-specific criteria, and books estimates directly to your
    calendar—turning more ad clicks and missed calls into real, ready-to-buy
    appointments.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continually improving, flooring-specific conversation and qualification
    engine trained on real outcomes (from-square-footage and material signals to
    close probability), plus deep CRM/calendar integrations that allow true
    one-call booking—hard for general AI or receptionist services to replicate.
