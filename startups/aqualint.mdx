  problem:
    - >-
      Growers lack per-field, timely guidance on when and how long to irrigate,
      leading to over/under-watering and yield loss.
    - >-
      High variability in weather, soil, and system capacity makes rule-of-thumb
      scheduling unreliable, especially under water or energy constraints.
    - >-
      Existing tools are sensor-heavy, hard to maintain at scale, or too generic
      (not cotton-specific) to convert ET into actionable run-times.
    - >-
      Managing multiple pivots/sets across 500–10,000 acres overwhelms farm
      managers, causing missed irrigation windows and inefficiencies.
    - >-
      Rising pumping costs and water limitations demand measurable water-use
      efficiency gains and documentation for compliance and cost-share programs.
    - >-
      Consultants and dealers need scalable, defensible recommendations and
      reporting to justify services and retain clients.
  solution:
    - >-
      Remote agent computes daily field-level ETc using crop-stage-aware models
      blending satellite canopy (Sentinel/Landsat/optional Planet) with local
      weather forecasts and on-farm rainfall.
    - >-
      Weekly irrigation schedules translate ET deficits into actionable
      run-times by system type (pivot, drip, set), capacity, and pump
      constraints.
    - >-
      Proactive alerts (SMS/WhatsApp/app) when soil water drops below
      thresholds, rain is forecast, or a schedule is missed; includes heatwave
      surge recommendations.
    - >-
      Simple onboarding: import field boundaries, specify system capacity,
      typical set lengths, and planting/emergence dates; optional soil texture
      selection or auto-lookup.
    - >-
      Calibration loop: assimilate observed canopy growth and irrigation logs to
      refine Kc and effective rainfall, improving accuracy mid-season.
    - >-
      Reporting: season-long water budget, cost savings, bales per acre-foot,
      compliance and cost-share documentation, and consultant-branded reports.
    - >-
      Integrations and automations: API to pivot/drip controllers, pump
      telemetry, and farm management systems; one-click run-time sync where
      supported.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cotton-specific, sensorless ET scheduling that turns satellite canopy and
    hyperlocal weather into weekly, field-level run-time prescriptions and
    alerts, improving water-use efficiency by 15–25% and increasing lint yields
    by 3–8%, with simple SMS/app workflows and integrations to existing
    irrigation hardware.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Validated, cotton-specific sensorless ET pipeline that converts satellite
    canopy and localized weather into run-time prescriptions with documented
    ROI, plus OEM/dealer distribution and closed-loop calibration from millions
    of historical acre-days—hard to replicate quickly without data access and
    partnerships.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cotton growers and irrigation managers who want confident, efficient
    watering that protects yield and profit.
  problem: >-
    Weather swings, soil variability, and time pressure make irrigation
    guesswork—causing over/under‑watering, wasted water and energy, and
    avoidable yield and fiber‑quality losses.
  guide: >-
    We’re irrigation agronomists and AI engineers who understand the stakes; our
    remote agent uses evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficients, weather,
    satellite, and soil data to deliver clear, field‑level recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Add field boundaries and system details; 2) AI estimates daily crop water
    use and soil moisture; 3) Receive weekly irrigation schedules plus alerts
    for rain, heat, or stress; 4) Irrigate with confidence and review results—no
    new hardware, cancel anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo now; or start a limited pilot and download a sample schedule
    with an ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    Right‑time, right‑amount irrigation; measurable water and energy savings;
    steadier yields and fiber quality; fewer stress days; simpler crew planning;
    compliance‑ready reports; peace of mind all season.
  failure: >-
    Missed irrigation windows, chronic crop stress, wasted water and energy,
    rising pumping costs, regulatory headaches, and a season of second‑guessing.
