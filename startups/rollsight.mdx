  problem:
    - >-
      Rolled steel shape mills lose 0.5–2.0% yield annually due to off-gauge,
      cobbles, threading loss, and scrap — translating to millions of dollars at
      typical volumes.
    - >-
      Cobbles cause unplanned downtime, damage to guides/rolls/stands, and
      safety incidents; root causes span multiple stands and process stages,
      making prevention non-trivial.
    - >-
      Existing analytics are siloed in PLC/SCADA/MES/quality systems; engineers
      spend hours manually aligning time-series and event logs across sources to
      diagnose issues.
    - >-
      General-purpose analytics tools lack mill-specific event detection, lag
      alignment across stands, and explainability tailored to rolling physics
      (tension, temperature, roll wear, loop stability).
    - >-
      Setup recipes drift with roll wear, grade changes, and ambient conditions;
      lack of closed-loop feedback exacerbates off-gauge lengths at head/tail
      and during speed changes.
    - >-
      Operators are fatigued by high false-alarm rates; without ranked,
      explainable drivers and confidence, alerts are ignored.
    - >-
      Digital projects stall due to long deployment cycles, inflexible
      IT/security requirements, and the need for on-prem/edge options in heavy
      industry.
    - >-
      Management lacks a transparent, ongoing measure of savings attribution to
      justify scale-up beyond pilots.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to Level 1/2 PLCs, historian (e.g., OSIsoft PI/Aveva), Level 3
      MES, inline gauges (laser thickness/shape), furnace data, and CMMS;
      auto-build asset model and tag dictionary.
    - >-
      Auto-detect and align mill events (threading, head/tail, stand-by-stand
      speed/torque, loop instability, guide interactions, roll changes, grade
      transitions) with correct inter-stand lags.
    - >-
      Apply multivariate event correlation and explainable ML (SHAP,
      counterfactuals) to rank drivers of yield loss, off-gauge, and cobbles by
      product, stand, and operating window.
    - >-
      Real-time cobble risk scoring at key transitions (threading/start-up,
      speed ramps, tail-out) with operator decision support and recommended
      actions.
    - >-
      Off-gauge analyzer quantifying head/tail trim loss, wedge/crown/shape
      deviations; prescribes setup tweaks by stand and roll condition.
    - >-
      What-changed diagnostics: compares golden runs vs. bad runs for same
      grade/size, surfacing statistically significant differences (e.g., furnace
      soak, loop tension setpoints, descaler pressure).
    - >-
      Closed-loop optional: export setpoint recommendations to Level 2 or
      operator HMI with guardrails and MOC logging.
    - >-
      Savings attribution and A/B testing module to quantify impact of changes
      and track ROI by SKU, stand, and shift.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut yield loss by 1–2% and reduce cobbles 20–40% within 6 months using
    explainable, mill-specific AI that finds and ranks true drivers across
    thousands of time-synced signals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A mill-specific event and lag-alignment engine plus an expanding, anonymized
    cross-mill event library enable faster deployment and higher-precision,
    explainable insights than generalist platforms; partnerships with OEMs/L2
    vendors accelerate access and trust.

  character: >-
    Mill managers and process/quality engineers in rolled steel shape
    manufacturing who must maximize yield, minimize cobbles, and keep gauge
    within spec.
  problem: >-
    Hidden, multivariate drivers of yield loss, off‑gauge, and cobbles are
    buried across historian, MES, lab, and maintenance data—teams firefight,
    guess at root causes, and pay in downtime, scrap, claims, and energy waste.
  guide: >-
    We’re steel‑savvy data scientists and mill veterans. Our explainable ML and
    multivariate event‑correlation engine turns noisy mill data into ranked,
    defensible root causes—no black box, secure, and mill‑ready.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect historian/MES/lab/maintenance data and event logs. 2) Correlate
    events and apply explainable ML to rank drivers of yield loss, off‑gauge,
    and cobbles. 3) Act on prioritized insights and alerts; iterate with SMEs to
    lock in gains.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30‑day pilot or a data‑readiness assessment.
  success: >-
    Recover yield, cut cobbles and off‑gauge, reduce RCA time from days to
    minutes, stabilize rolling, lift OEE, lower energy and scrap, and hit
    delivery and quality targets with confidence.
  failure: >-
    Keep bleeding margin to scrap, downtime, and claims; repeat cobbles and
    off‑gauge; miss shipments; strain crews; and fall behind mills that run on
    data‑driven root‑cause insight.
