  problem:
    - >-
      Growers leave $10–$35/acre on the table by allocating acres across crops
      and varieties using static budgets that ignore local basis, insurance
      interactions, and rotation constraints.
    - >-
      Field-level variability and historical yield risk aren’t incorporated into
      planning; most farms use county budgets or spreadsheets that can’t model
      stochastic outcomes or correlations.
    - >-
      Selecting crop insurance products (RP/YP, unit structure, SCO/ECO, TA-APH,
      YE) is complex; coverage choices materially change optimal crop mix but
      are evaluated separately from agronomic/market planning.
    - >-
      Local cash bids and basis are volatile and location-specific; few tools
      quantify delivery-point basis, storage, trucking, and drying costs in
      acreage planning.
    - >-
      Rotation rules (e.g., wheat–fallow, canola frequency, disease/pest breaks)
      and landlord or grower constraints are hard to encode and enforce at scale
      across 2,000–25,000 acres.
    - >-
      Planning is time-constrained (Nov–Mar); advisors juggle many clients,
      leading to rushed, suboptimal decisions and low scenario coverage.
    - >-
      Existing digital tools focus on recording and prescription maps, not on
      maximizing expected gross margin under risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest field boundaries, past yields (APH/monitor), soil/zone layers, and
      constraints; auto-build a stochastic planning baseline within 48 hours.
    - >-
      Integrate futures, local cash bids, and basis curves by delivery point;
      include storage, trucking, drying, and elevation fees to net back to the
      field.
    - >-
      Model historical yield distributions and correlations at field/zone level;
      run Monte Carlo to estimate expected gross margin and downside risk
      (P5/P10).
    - >-
      Encode rotation rules, landlord restrictions, fallow requirements, and
      agronomic constraints to filter feasible plans.
    - >-
      Optimize crop mix, varieties, and insurance combinations (RP/YP, unit
      structure, SCO/ECO, TA-APH, YE) to maximize expected gross margin subject
      to risk limits (e.g., CV or P10 thresholds).
    - >-
      Provide side-by-side scenarios (e.g., bullish/bearish basis, late
      planting, moisture stress) and sensitivity analysis (price, yield, basis,
      input costs).
    - >-
      Export planting intentions, product/variety lists, insurance selections,
      and delivery plans; generate advisor/client-ready PDF and API outputs.
    - >-
      Optional advisory workflow: collaborate with grower, agronomist,
      merchandiser, and insurance agent; track approvals and changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field-level, market-driven acreage and variety planning that integrates
    local basis, insurance, and rotation constraints to maximize expected gross
    margin—delivering a measurable $12–$25/acre uplift with transparent
    scenarios and compliance-ready plans.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    An integrated, field-level optimizer that simultaneously considers local
    basis, insurance choices, and agronomic rotation constraints—paired with
    delivery-point logistics and validated ROI audits. Proprietary localized
    basis-yield datasets and agency/co-op distribution create defensible network
    effects and switching costs.

    Diversified grain growers and farm managers (All Other Grain Farming:
    sorghum, barley, oats, rye, millet, triticale) who want confident rotation,
    variety, and acreage decisions that maximize expected gross margin.
  problem: >-
    Markets, weather, and insurance rules change faster than spreadsheets;
    ignoring local basis, yield risk, and rotation constraints turns planning
    into guesswork, compliance risk, and missed margin.
  guide: >-
    Rotation, Variety, and Market-Driven Planning is an AI co-pilot from ag
    economists and data scientists that ingests local basis, historical yields,
    insurance and rotation rules to recommend profitable, compliant crop mixes.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect fields, yield history, and local market/insurance data; 2) Set
    constraints and goals; 3) Get an optimized crop/variety/acreage plan with
    scenarios, then implement and monitor.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 20-minute demo or start a no-obligation pilot on a subset of
    fields.
  success: >-
    Make timely, evidence-based plans that maximize expected gross margin,
    improve risk-adjusted returns, maintain rotation and insurance compliance,
    and turn market signals into field-level action.
  failure: >-
    Keep over/under-planting, risk insurance or rotation violations, misread
    local basis, absorb avoidable yield risk, and leave profit on the table.
