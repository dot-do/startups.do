  problem:
    - >-
      Bid teams at transformer OEMs must trade off materials/design choices
      against utility-specific loss capitalization factors, often using
      spreadsheets and heuristics that misprice evaluated cost.
    - >-
      Tender specs vary widely by market and utility (e.g., different $/W for
      no-load and load losses, different duty cycles), causing compliance errors
      and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Commodity price volatility (CRGO/amorphous steel, copper, aluminum) and
      logistics lead to inaccurate BOM cost forecasts during bid, eroding
      win-rate or margin once awarded.
    - >-
      Slow proposal turnarounds (multi-day engineering loops) reduce
      competitiveness in fast-moving tenders and framework agreements.
    - >-
      Historical tender outcomes and field performance aren’t systematically
      used to optimize future bids (no probabilistic win/margin model).
    - >-
      Fragmented tools (PLM/ERP/CPQ/point simulations) create duplicate data
      entry, risk of errors, and weak governance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Tender intelligence: parse documents/drawings to extract rating,
      efficiency class, loss factors, standards (IEC/IEEE/DOE), and commercial
      terms.
    - >-
      Loss capitalization engine: compute evaluated cost using utility- and
      country-specific $/W for no-load and load losses, with duty cycle and
      ambient assumptions; maintain a versioned library.
    - >-
      Design choice optimizer: recommend core/conductor materials, stack
      factors, winding scheme, cooling class, and window dimensions to hit loss
      targets at least cost.
    - >-
      Probabilistic bid model: estimate win probability vs price and design
      attributes using historical tender outcomes; recommend price and design
      for target win-rate or margin.
    - >-
      BOM and cost forecaster: generate BOM and cost ranges with commodity
      forecasts (copper/CRGO/aluminum) and logistics; sensitivity to FX and lead
      time.
    - >-
      Scenario planner: run A/B designs under multiple loss factor schemes,
      material substitutions, and supplier quotes; provide Pareto frontier of
      margin vs win probability.
    - >-
      Governance and guardrails: enforce approval workflows, margin floors, and
      spec compliance; full audit trail.
    - >-
      Connectors: integrate with PLM/CAD (Teamcenter/3DEXPERIENCE), ERP/CPQ
      (SAP/Oracle/Salesforce/Tacton), and tender portals (Ariba, government
      e-procurement).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven bid optimization that selects the best design-cost-loss tradeoff
    per tender, increasing win-rate 10–25% and margin 1–3 percentage points
    while cutting proposal time by 40–60%. LCO unifies tender requirements, loss
    factor libraries, commodity forecasts, and historical outcomes into a single
    decision engine with auditable, compliant recommendations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, versioned global library of loss capitalization factors and
    tender compliance rules tied to historical outcomes, combined with
    physics-informed optimization and probabilistic pricing models. Over time,
    network effects from multi-market tender data and supplier price signals
    improve recommendations beyond what any single OEM’s in-house tools can
    achieve.

  problem:
    - >-
      Margins hinge on loss capitalization; manual trade-offs often miss the
