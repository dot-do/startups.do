leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned compressor/driver/cooler outages cause lost throughput and
      contractual penalties; a single 12–24 hr unplanned outage can cost
      $100k–$750k including imbalance charges and emergency crew mobilization.
    - >-
      OEM condition monitoring and generic PdM tools miss pipeline-specific
      failure modes (e.g., surge-related damage, fouling-induced efficiency
      loss, cooler fan gear failures) or generate high false-positive rates,
      eroding trust.
    - >-
      Maintenance windows are poorly optimized against gas nominations, seasonal
      demand, crew availability, and parts lead times; work is either rushed or
      deferred, both increasing risk.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across SCADA/PI historians, vibration systems, lube oil
      labs, and CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo); operators lack a unified risk-prioritized
      view and automated work order creation.
    - >-
      Spare parts planning is reactive; lead times for bearings, seals, and
      turbine parts are 8–26 weeks, causing expedited shipping and premium
      charges.
    - >-
      Aging workforce and turnover reduce tacit knowledge; failure mode
      diagnosis and root-cause learning are inconsistent across stations.
    - >-
      Regulatory pressure (PHMSA, TSA cyber directives) increases documentation
      and incident prevention expectations without adding headcount.
  solution:
    - >-
      Pipeline-specific AI models that predict failure modes for compressors
      (bearings, seals, surge-induced damage, rotor rubs), drivers (gas turbine
      hot section degradation, motor winding insulation, coupling misalignment),
      and coolers (fan gearbox/bearing wear, motor faults, fin fouling).
    - >-
      Maintenance window optimizer that simulates throughput impact,
      nominations, seasonal demand, crew schedules, and parts constraints to
      recommend the lowest-cost time to intervene.
    - >-
      Unified risk dashboard with asset health scores, remaining useful life
      (RUL) estimates, and automated CMMS work order creation, kitted with
      tasks, parts, and labor plans.
    - >-
      Edge-to-cloud architecture: secure site gateway for real-time inference
      from vibration/SCADA; cloud analytics for fleet benchmarking and model
      updates.
    - >-
      Spare parts forecasting and critical spares risk index to reduce stockouts
      and expedite fees.
    - >-
      Regulatory-ready reporting (event logs, alarm rationalization, evidence of
      preventive actions) aligned to pipeline reliability goals and TSA cyber
      practices.
    - >-
      Expert-in-the-loop review workflows to capture tribal knowledge and
      continuously improve model recall and precision.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned rotating equipment outages by 30–50% and cut maintenance
    OPEX 10–20% by predicting specific failure modes and proposing optimal
    maintenance windows aligned to nominations, demand, crew calendars, and
    parts availability—integrated directly with SCADA/PI and CMMS for
    closed-loop execution.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, pipeline-specific rotating equipment failure mode library
    with labeled events and explainable features, enriched through OEM and
    operator partnerships; combined with a maintenance window optimizer that
