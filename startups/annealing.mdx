  problem:
    - >-
      High and variable residual stress in annealed flat glass leads to
      downstream breakage during cutting, handling, and tempering, causing scrap
      rates of 0.5–3.0% and unplanned downtime.
    - >-
      Operators rely on tribal knowledge and static recipes; frequent product
      mix changes (thickness, coatings, color) make manual lehr tuning slow and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Conservative lehr settings protect quality but waste energy (3–10%
      avoidable) and cap line speed, limiting throughput.
    - >-
      Limited instrumentation and siloed data (SCADA/PLC, MES, lab polarimetry)
      prevent closed-loop optimization and early detection of thermal profile
      drift.
    - >-
      Quality variation between shifts and plants undermines standardization and
      makes root cause analysis slow (days/weeks).
    - >-
      OEM controls optimize for stability, not cost/quality trade-offs; offline
      thermal simulations are not connected to real-time production.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to existing sensors (pyrometers, thermocouples, thermal cameras if
      available), PLC/SCADA tags, line speed, product recipes, and QC stress
      data (polarimetry) via an edge gateway.
    - >-
      Build a plant-specific digital twin of the annealing lehr combining heat
      transfer and viscoelastic relaxation physics with machine learning trained
      on historical runs and lab results.
    - >-
      Real-time advisor computes optimal zone temperature profile and speed for
      the current glass thickness, color, coating, ambient conditions, and
      upstream temperature, subject to safety and product constraints.
    - >-
      Operator UI shows recommended setpoints, predicted stress distribution,
      expected impact on breakage, energy, and throughput; supports one-click
      apply or operator approval workflows.
    - >-
      Closed-loop mode (optional) writes setpoints to PLC with guardrails, ramp
      rates, and interlocks; A/B testing mode allows controlled trials and
      automatic comparison to baseline.
    - >-
      Recipe intelligence auto-generates and manages product-specific lehr
      recipes; alerts on drift, sensor faults, and deviations from golden
      profiles; provides root-cause analysis and shift benchmarking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    conveyor speed setpoints tailored to each product mix, cutting residual
    stress and breakage while increasing speed and reducing energy—delivering

  character: >-
    Flat glass plant managers, process engineers, and lehr operators who need
    predictable annealing quality, fewer breaks, and higher yield across a
    shifting product mix.
  problem: >-
    - External: Residual stress variation drives breakage, scrap, rework, and
    warranty risk; recipes don’t transfer cleanly across widths/thicknesses;
    conservative setpoints waste energy.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting and reliance on tribal knowledge under
    pressure to hit yield, OTIF, and energy KPIs.

    - Philosophical: Annealing should be predictable and data‑driven—operators
    shouldn’t have to guess.
