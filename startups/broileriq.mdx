leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Price volatility and thin margins: feed, freight, fuel, and import costs
      move weekly; many wholesalers still update price lists 1–2x/week via
      spreadsheets, leading to 50–200 bps margin leakage.
    - >-
      Inventory aging and waste: fresh/chilled SKUs have short shelf life; 1–3%
      of inventory value lost to markdowns and spoilage due to late or blunt
      price adjustments.
    - >-
      Slow, inconsistent quoting: quote turnaround often 2–24 hours;
      inconsistent discounting across reps; missed end-of-day cutoffs reduce
      fill rates and revenue.
    - >-
      Customer-specific complexity: contract indexation (e.g., Urner Barry
      formulas), rebates, tiered pricing, and freight surcharges are error-prone
      and not consistently enforced.
    - >-
      Insufficient market signal integration: market indexes (Urner Barry, USDA
      AMS), futures (corn/soy), and competitor signals are not systematically
      incorporated into prices.
    - >-
      Limited governance: weak approval workflows and audit trails cause
      off-listing and ad-hoc exceptions; compliance exposure during recalls or
      audits.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: ERP, WMS, EDI, CRM, and spreadsheets create silos; no
      single source of truth for costs, landed costs, fees, and lot aging.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data integration: connect ERP, WMS, EDI, CRM, and supplier feeds;
      normalize SKUs, lots, costs, and customer terms into a pricing-ready data
      layer.
    - >-
      Pricing intelligence engine: AI models blend market indexes (Urner Barry,
      USDA AMS), feed/freight proxies, demand seasonality, and inventory aging
      to recommend prices by SKU, lot, and customer.
    - >-
      Quotation copilot: auto-draft multi-line quotes with guardrails, freight
      and rebate logic, customer-specific terms, and approval workflows; push
      via email/EDI/portal.
    - >-
      Dynamic list management: maintain price matrices and customer price lists;
      scheduled or event-driven updates (cost change, inventory aging, market
      moves).
    - >-
      Governance and compliance: margin floors by category/lot age, exception
      tracking, audit logs, and contract indexation automation; traceability
      references for lots on quotes.
    - >-
      Insights and simulation: what-if scenarios (cost, demand, freight), price
      elasticity signals, markdown planning for short-dated stock, and cohort
      margin analytics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn live costs, inventory aging, and market indices into optimal,
    customer-specific prices and auto-drafted quotes—raising realized margins
    100–300 bps and cutting quote time to minutes while reducing spoilage.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Lot-aware, poultry-specific pricing models and indexation logic pre-trained
    on protein demand patterns (e.g., seasonal wing spikes around sports
    seasons, holiday and Ramadan effects), combined with an integration library
    for the most common ERP/WMS stacks and access to premium market data
    partnerships. Early reference accounts enable anonymized benchmarking and
    faster time-to-value than horizontal pricing tools.
