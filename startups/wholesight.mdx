leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High stockouts (2–6% line-item) on promoted/seasonal SKUs causing lost
      sales and retailer penalties
    - >-
      Excess inventory ties up working capital; typical inventory turns of 9–12x
      with 5–10% obsolete/slow movers
    - >-
      ERP/WMS-native forecasting lacks promotion, weather, and lead-time
      variability modeling; heavy reliance on spreadsheets
    - >-
      Supplier lead times are volatile (ETA slippage, partial fills) and not
      modeled in reorder policies
    - >-
      DC-level demand is heterogeneous; single national forecast underperforms
      at SKU-DC-week granularity
    - >-
      Forecast accuracy is not measured consistently (no WMAPE bias tracking by
      hierarchy); hard to prove ROI
    - >-
      IT/data science bandwidth is limited; integrations and model maintenance
      are burdensome
  solution:
    - >-
      Data-driven SKU-DC weekly forecasting with models tuned for grocery
      seasonality, holidays, weather, and promotions
    - >-
      Lead-time-aware reorder planning (ROP/Min-Max) that incorporates supplier
      variability, case pack, MOQs, and service targets
    - >-
      Promotion uplift modeling (TPR/BOGO/feature/display) with cannibalization
      and forward-buy logic
    - >-
      Weather and event signals mapped to DC trade areas for demand modulation
      (heat waves, storms, holidays)
    - >-
      Constraint-aware recommendations: supplier caps, truckload optimization,
      budget constraints
    - >-
      Integrated planner workflows: approve, override, and simulate orders;
      audit trail; exception-based alerts
    - >-
      APIs and prebuilt connectors to common ERPs/WMS; auto-deploy via cloud
      marketplace
    - >-
      Continuous learning with bias correction, new item forecasting, and
      substitution logic
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut stockouts by 15–30% and reduce on-hand inventory 7–12% within 90 days by
    delivering SKU-DC weekly forecasts and auto-generated reorder plans that
    adapt to promotions, weather, and volatile lead times—integrated to your
    ERP/WMS with measurable accuracy and service-level SLAs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing cross-wholesaler signal network with anonymized benchmarks on
    lead-time variability, promo uplift, and weather sensitivity by category
    enables faster, more accurate cold-starts and continuous improvements that
    ERP-native modules and new entrants can’t match. Prebuilt ERP/EDI connectors
    shorten time-to-value to <6 weeks.

    Grocery wholesale replenishment managers and supply chain leaders who need
    accurate SKU-DC weekly forecasts and replenishment to hit service levels,
    reduce inventory, and cut waste.
  problem: >-
    Demand is volatile and local. Promotions, holidays, weather, and variable
    lead times make manual spreadsheets and simple rules miss the mark, causing
    stockouts, overstock, rush fees, and margin erosion.

    We understand general line grocery complexity. Our purpose-built AI ingests
    history, on-hand, lead times, vendor calendars, promotions, and weather to
    produce SKU-DC forecasts and reorder plans. Fast implementation, clear
    explanations, and planner-first workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and integrate with ERP/WMS. 2) Calibrate models and service
    targets by category and DC. 3) Generate weekly SKU-DC forecasts and reorder
    plans factoring lead times, seasonality, weather, and promotions. 4) Review
    exceptions, approve or auto-release POs, and track accuracy and service
    KPIs.
