leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual NCR/CAPA processing is slow and inconsistent: typical triage lead
      time is 2–5 days per NCR and 8D/corrective report drafting consumes 3–8
      hours of senior engineer time per incident.
    - >-
      Duplicate and related issues are not systematically clustered, leading to
      10–25% duplicated effort across plants and suppliers.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis quality varies by engineer; incomplete 5-Why/Ishikawa
      analysis causes recurrence rates of 10–30% for chronic issues.
    - >-
      Knowledge from past NCRs and effective corrective actions is siloed across
      systems (QMS, MES, PLM, email), reducing organizational learning and
      repeatability.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (ISO 9001/IATF 16949/AS9100/ISO 13485/21 CFR Part 11)
      demands audit-ready, standardized 8D output; manual compilation increases
      audit risk and rework.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced quality engineers limits throughput; overtime and
      delayed closures drive Cost of Poor Quality (CoPQ) by 1–3% of revenue in
      many plants.
    - >-
      Supplier corrective action (SCAR) loops are slow; cross-company
      communication and evidence packaging add 1–2 weeks to closure times.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from QMS/MES/PLM, email, and files; normalize NCRs, SCARs,
      defects, and dispositions into a unified schema and taxonomy.
    - >-
      Unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering to group similar NCRs across
      lines/plants/suppliers; dedupe and flag systemic issues early.
    - >-
      AI-assisted 5-Why/Ishikawa suggestions grounded in prior accepted
      solutions, process parameters, and FMEA linkages; human-in-the-loop
      validation.
    - >-
      Auto-drafting of 8D reports aligned to customer templates and standards
      (IATF/AS9100/ISO 13485), including evidence packaging, metrics, and
      e-signature routing.
    - >-
      Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) recommendations with risk,
      feasibility, and cost impact scoring; ties to control plans and FMEAs.
    - >-
      Supplier portal/SCAR package generation and collaboration with traceable
      threads and timelines.
    - >-
      Analytics: recurrence heatmaps, closure SLA dashboards, CoPQ impact, and
      ROI tracking; alerts when recurrence risk exceeds thresholds.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: private cloud/VPC or on-prem; SSO, role-based
      access, audit trails, and data residency controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce NCR cycle time 50–70% and 8D drafting time 70–90% with an AI copilot
    that clusters issues, proposes defensible 5-Why and corrective actions, and
    drafts audit-ready 8D reports that integrate with your existing
    QMS/MES/PLM—without compromising security or compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from accepted 8D outcomes across multiple industries
    and systems, paired with domain ontologies and deep QMS/MES integrations,
    yields higher-quality, audit-ready drafts that general LLM tools or generic
    QMS add-ons cannot reliably produce—backed by demonstrable ROI and
    security/compliance posture suitable for regulated manufacturers.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and Manufacturing leaders at hardware manufacturers who must resolve
    NCRs quickly, prevent recurrence, and deliver audit-ready corrective
    actions.
  problem: >-
    NCRs pile up; evidence is scattered across MES/ERP/PLM; 5-Why and 8D are
    inconsistent and slow—causing downtime, chargebacks, customer escalations,
    and audit findings.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of MRB boards and customer audits. Our AI
    clusters similar issues, proposes 5-Why and corrective actions, and drafts
    standard-compliant 8D reports—integrated with your tools and kept
    human-in-the-loop.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data sources and select a pilot line. 2) Auto-triage NCRs and
    review drafted 8D reports with your team. 3) Roll out site-wide, track
    closure time and recurrence, and continuously tune actions.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a 4-week pilot. Secondary: Book a 30-minute demo or download
    a sample 8D report.
  success: >-
    Cut triage and reporting time by 50-80%; standardize 8D quality; shrink NCR
    backlog; reduce repeat defects and escapes; pass audits with confidence;
    lower cost of poor quality.
  failure: >-
    Without change: growing NCR backlog, repeat issues, missed shipments,
    auditor findings, supplier chargebacks, and eroding margins.
