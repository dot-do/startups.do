  problem:
    - >-
      Store managers spend 4–10 hours/week building schedules in spreadsheets or
      generic tools, often missing demand peaks (lunchtime, commute hours,
      lottery jackpots, storms) and overstaffing slow periods.
    - >-
      Labor is 30–40% of operating expense; a 3–8% labor inefficiency materially
      impacts margins, especially with thin per-gallon profits.
    - >-
      Compliance complexity (minor labor laws, meal/rest breaks, predictive
      scheduling cities, NJ/OR full-service fueling, alcohol/tobacco age rules)
      causes violations, fines, and rework.
    - >-
      High turnover (60–100%/yr typical) and last-minute call-offs create
      chronic understaffing and manager burnout.
    - >-
      Multi-site operators lack visibility into labor cost as % of sales,
      overtime leakage, and schedule adherence; decisions are reactive rather
      than data-driven.
    - >-
      Existing WFM tools don’t forecast fuel+c-store demand together, don’t
      integrate with industry POS/fuel systems, and lack forecourt-specific
      skill/role logic.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting using POS transactions, fuel pump throughput,
      weather, traffic, and local events to predict 15–30 minute footfall and
      service demand.
    - >-
      Optimization engine converts demand into compliant, cost-efficient
      schedules by role (cashier, kitchen/foodservice, forecourt attendant in
      NJ/OR, car wash) and skill/age constraints.
    - >-
      One-tap publish and automatic multi-channel notifications (app, SMS,
      email); shift marketplace for voluntary swaps/bids with built-in approval
      rules.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: predictive scheduling locales, minor hour limits,
      meal/rest breaks, overtime thresholds, alcohol/tobacco age handling,
      split-shift avoidance, required late-night staffing rules.
    - >-
      Real-time adjustments for call-offs and demand spikes; suggested backfills
      ranked by cost, proximity, and availability; geofenced clock-in to prevent
      early/late punches.
    - >-
      Analytics: labor cost as % of sales, OT leakage, forecast accuracy (MAPE),
      schedule adherence, fill rates; what-if budgeting and seasonal templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce labor cost 4–10% and manager scheduling time by 70–85% with
    demand-driven, compliant schedules tailored to forecourt and c-store
    operations—integrated with your POS, fuel, and payroll systems and
    auto-notifying staff in minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized forecasting + compliance engine trained on fuel and c-store
    patterns, integrated with industry-standard POS/fuel systems, and a growing
    proprietary dataset that improves accuracy network-wide—backed by partner
    co-sell relationships and ROI-positive case studies.
