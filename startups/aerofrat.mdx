leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or basic FRATs are time-consuming (10–20 minutes/flight) and prone
      to stale data; safety managers struggle to ensure consistency across
      crews.
    - >-
      Live operational risks (rapidly changing weather, TFRs/NOTAMs,
      runway/terrain, crew fatigue) are not automatically fused into a single,
      actionable risk picture.
    - >-
      Mitigations are generic or after-the-fact; operators lack contextual,
      operator-specific recommendations and audit-ready rationale.
    - >-
      Part 135/91 operators face growing SMS expectations and insurer scrutiny
      but lack defensible, measurable risk controls linked to outcomes.
    - >-
      Existing tools are fragmented across EFBs, scheduling, and SMS platforms,
      creating duplicated entry, version control issues, and poor adoption.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest live data (METAR/TAF, NOTAMs/TFRs, winds aloft, turbulence/icing,
      runway and field condition reports, terrain/obstacle risk, airport
      performance factors) and automatically pre-fill a FRAT.
    - >-
      Combine crew factors (duty time, recency, training currency, pairing,
      MEL/CDL) via integrations with scheduling/maintenance systems to produce
      an objective, operator-weighted risk score.
    - >-
      Generate context-specific mitigations (reroute/alt, fuel reserves, runway
      changes, crew rest/augmentation, departure time shift) with evidence and
      alternatives ranked by impact vs. cost.
    - >-
      One-click export to SMS platforms and audit packs; store a full data
      lineage (what data, when, and why) for each risk decision.
    - >-
      Operator-configurable rules engine and ML-assisted risk tuning: adapt
      weights/thresholds based on outcomes while maintaining human-in-the-loop
      control.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, data-fused FRATs with operator-tuned scoring that cut completion
    time to under 2 minutes, proactively propose mitigations, and create an
    auditable, insurer-friendly risk record—without changing your existing
    workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Operator-tuned, ML-assisted mitigation engine with verifiable data lineage
    and broad, native integrations that minimize manual entry—backed by
    insurer-recognized reporting and de-identified industry benchmarks few
    competitors can assemble.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      US Part 135 on-demand charter and air taxi operators (3–50 aircraft,
      limited safety staff).

  character: >-
    Safety managers, chief pilots, and dispatchers for nonscheduled air
    operators (NAICS 481219) who need fast, consistent, auditable FRATs across
    varied missions, aircraft, and bases.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather, NOTAMs, airport hazards, crew and duty factors change
    minute-to-minute while FRATs stay manual and stale. Internal: Teams feel
    pressure to launch on time and worry about missing a risk or mis-scoring.
    Philosophical: Every go/no-go decision should be data-driven, transparent,
    and defensible.
  guide: >-
    We understand the realities of ad-hoc operations—last-minute trips,
    unfamiliar airports, fatigue risk, customer pressure. Built with input from
    Part 135 safety and dispatch leaders and aligned with FAA/ICAO SMS
    principles, our Automated FRAT Builder ingests live weather/NOTAMs, airport
    risk data, crew factors, and your operator scoring to produce consistent
    FRATs with recommended mitigations and full documentation.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Link flight planning, fleet, and crew data; enable live
    weather/NOTAM feeds. 2) Configure: Import SOPs and scoring; set thresholds,
    mitigations, and approvals. 3) Operate: Generate FRATs per leg with
    suggested mitigations, apply/override, capture approvals, and auto-archive
    to SMS and audits.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 14-day trial or book a 30-minute safety demo. Transitional:
    Download a sample FRAT and mitigation library.
  success: >-
    Dispatch and crews make clear, consistent go/no-go calls in minutes;
    mitigations are suggested and tracked; leadership sees trends; audits pass
    with complete records; safety culture strengthens without slowing
    operations.
  failure: >-
    Manual FRATs remain inconsistent and outdated; risks are missed; approvals
    stall; audit findings accumulate; avoidable delays or incidents erode
    customer trust and margin.

  problem:
    - Manual FRATs are slow and inconsistent across crews and dispatch.
    - Weather/NOTAM changes make paper or static FRATs stale.
    - Airport‑specific hazards aren’t standardized or easy to apply.
    - 'Crew duty, rest, and currency are not automatically factored.'
    - One‑size‑fits‑all scoring doesn’t match your SOPs.
    - Mitigations are ad hoc and poorly documented.
    - 'Audits require traceability, signatures, and time‑stamped records.'
  solution:
    - AI builds and updates FRATs from live data and your scoring model.
    - Auto‑suggested mitigations reduce risk and document decisions.
    - Real‑time alerts re‑score trips when weather or NOTAMs change.
    - 'One‑click sign‑off, escalation, and export for SMS and audits.'
    - 'Integrates with scheduling, EFB, and ops tools via API.'

      rosters.
    - 'Enter or import trip details: tail, crew, route, ETD/ETA.'
    - >-
      Review the auto‑built FRAT; adjust factors and apply suggested
      mitigations.
