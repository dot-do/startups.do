  problem:
    - >-
      Fuel is the second-largest operating cost for inland passenger vessels;
      most operators lack decision-support to optimize speed and departures
      within tight timetables.
    - >-
      Schedules are fixed, but river flow, lock queues, no‑wake zones, and
      weather create variability that leads to unnecessary speed-ups and fuel
      burn.
    - >-
      Many fleets have limited telemetry (no fuel flow meters, sparse engine
      data), making fuel performance benchmarking and forecasting difficult.
    - >-
      Captains rely on heuristics that vary by individual; institutional
      knowledge doesn’t scale across crews, routes, and seasons.
    - >-
      Regulators and municipalities increasingly expect emissions reporting and
      reduction plans, but operators lack easy, defensible metrics.
    - >-
      Existing voyage optimization tools target deep-sea shipping or require
      expensive instrumentation not suited to inland passenger fleets.
    - >-
      Operators need clear ROI with minimal workflow disruption and fast payback
      to justify digital investments.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven speed and departure advisory that accounts for schedule
      constraints, river flow, locks, no‑wake zones, and weather.
    - >-
      Vessel-specific fuel-burn estimation using lightweight calibration (AIS
      speed over ground, RPM if available, basic vessel particulars) to deliver
      accurate predictions without full telemetry.
    - >-
      Departure-time suggestions to avoid lock congestion and no‑wake
      bottlenecks, minimizing speed-ups later in the leg.
    - >-
      Simple bridge and wheelhouse app with real-time guidance, ETA confidence
      bands, and compliance prompts; offline-capable for patchy connectivity.
    - >-
      Management dashboard with route/vessel benchmarks (gal/nm, gal/trip,
      $/trip), savings attribution, and CO2 reporting.
    - >-
      “Savings Audit” pre-sale: analyze historical AIS and timetable to quantify
      expected savings before pilot.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce fuel burn 5–12% while maintaining on-time performance by recommending
    optimal speed windows and departures—works even with limited telemetry—plus
    verifiable fuel and CO2 tracking for reports and bids.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Lock- and no‑wake-aware optimization trained on inland passenger routes with
    accurate fuel estimates from minimal telemetry, plus validated pilots and
    datasets operators don’t have—and a captain-first UX proven to drive high
    adherence without expensive hardware.

  character: >-
    Ops leaders, captains, and dispatchers in Inland Water Passenger
    Transportation (NAICS 483212) who must keep fixed routes on time while
    cutting fuel and emissions.
  problem: >-
    Fuel costs are volatile, river and lock conditions shift, and telemetry is
    often limited—making it hard to pick the right speed and departure time
    without wasting fuel or risking delays.
  guide: >-
    An AI speed advisory and consumption-tracking service purpose-built for
    inland passenger fleets—transparent, easy to use, and effective even with
    sparse sensors.
  plan: >-
    Connect schedule, AIS/GPS, and basic engine/fuel logs (or manual inputs) ->
    run a 2–4 week pilot to calibrate vessel/route burn curves and speed
    windows, even with limited telemetry -> go live with per-trip departure
    timing and speed bands, bridge prompts, and a dashboard for savings and
    compliance.
  callToAction: >-
    Request a route savings forecast and start a 30‑day pilot on your two
    highest-traffic routes.
  success: >-
    Crews run on time at the lowest practical fuel burn; costs and emissions
    drop; ride quality improves; savings are verified and report-ready; ops
    decisions stay data-driven even when sensors are sparse.
  failure: >-
    Fuel spend remains unpredictable; crews over- or under-speed; schedules slip
    or require excessive padding; emissions targets are missed; managers lack
    credible visibility into burn and savings.
