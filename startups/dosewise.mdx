  problem:
    - >-
      Operators often over-dose coagulants/polymer/disinfectants to avoid permit
      violations, inflating chemical spend by 10–35% ($30k–$500k+/yr per plant)
      and increasing sludge handling costs.
    - >-
      Influent quality and flow vary hourly (storm events, industrial
      discharges), but most plants use fixed setpoints, slow jar tests, or
      simple PID loops not optimized for multi-objective targets (TP, turbidity,
      fecal/FC/CT, residual chlorine).
    - >-
      Data is siloed across SCADA/PLC, LIMS, and online analyzers; noisy or
      drifting sensors degrade control decisions and trust.
    - >-
      Regulatory requirements are tightening (e.g., TP ≤ 0.1 mg/L, E. coli
      limits), raising compliance risk and legal exposure from episodic
      under-dosing.
    - >-
      Chemical pump limits, polymer shear sensitivity, clarifier loading rates,
      and pH windows create hard constraints that typical controls don’t
      respect, leading to process upsets.
    - >-
      Utilities face staffing shortages; knowledge resides in a few senior
      operators, creating operational variability shift-to-shift.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in from chemical suppliers or OEM-specific control packages
      restricts optimization across multi-vendor equipment and changing chemical
      prices.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and clean real-time plant data (flow, pH, ORP, turbidity, TP/PO4-P
      analyzers, fecal indicators proxies/surrogates, residual chlorine, polymer
      feed, coagulant dose, temperature, jar test results, lab TP) from
      SCADA/PLC and LIMS via secure connectors.
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML models predict effluent quality vs. dose under current
      influent conditions and process constraints; produce recommended dosing
      ranges and confidence intervals every 5–15 minutes.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer minimizes $/MG chemical cost and sludge
      production while respecting hard constraints (pump capacity, polymer shear
      limits, pH window, CT requirements, chlorine residual upper bounds,
      clarifier overflow rates).
    - >-
      Operator UI shows recommended min/target/max dose, predicted effluent
      outcomes, cost impact, and confidence; supports A/B testing and what-if
      scenarios (e.g., chemical price changes, storm forecast).
    - >-
      Optional closed-loop mode writes setpoints to PLC with guardrails and
      automatic fallback to last-known-good or operator control.
    - >-
      Automated compliance and savings reporting (monthly, quarterly) with audit
      trails for regulators and finance.
    - >-
      Onboarding playbook: 8–12 weeks from kickoff—data assessment, baseline
      model build with 3–6 months historical data, shadow-mode validation, pilot
      acceptance criteria (KPIs), then go-live.

  character: >-
    Plant operators and managers at sewage treatment facilities who must
    consistently hit TP, turbidity, and disinfection targets while controlling
    chemical spend.
  problem: >-
    External: Influent variability, changing water chemistry, and manual
    trial-and-error lead to over/under-dosing and permit risk. Internal: Teams
    are tired of guesswork, alarms, and weekend callouts. Philosophical: You
    shouldn’t have to choose between compliance and cost.
  guide: >-
    We understand the daily pressure to protect public health and meet permits.
    Our team blends process engineering and AI to turn analyzer and lab data
    into clear, constraint-aware dosing recommendations. The agent is
    transparent, auditable, and built to work with your SCADA/LIMS and operator
    judgment.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate SCADA/analyzers/LIMS; set targets (TP, turbidity,
    disinfection) and process constraints (chemical types, pump limits,
    alkalinity/ORP bounds, polymer shear limits, contact time). 2) Calibrate:
    Back-test on historical runs, validate ranges with operators, set guardrails
    and overrides. 3) Operate: Get live dosing ranges with confidence bands,
    alerts for data quality or process drift, and simple adopt/adjust actions.
    4) Improve: Continuous learning, weekly performance summaries, and phased
    rollout across trains/chemicals.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo and start a 30-day pilot on one train. Transitional:
    Request a sample report and readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - Reliable compliance for TP, turbidity, and disinfection targets. -
    Measurable reduction in chemical costs and avoidable sludge production. -
    Fewer upsets, retests, and callouts; more operator confidence. -
    Transparent, auditable recommendations and documented ROI. - Scalable across
    plants, trains, and chemicals with continuous improvement.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing guesswork, overdosing costs, and underdosing violations. -
    Reactive firefighting during upsets and data-quality issues. - Higher sludge
    handling costs and chemical waste. - No clear record of why dosing changed
    or what worked.
