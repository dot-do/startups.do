  problem:
    - >-
      Energy-intensity drift across furnace, tin bath, and lehr zones goes
      undetected for weeks as refractory ages, cullet ratio fluctuates, and
      ambient conditions change, leading to 3–10% higher kWh/ton than necessary.
    - >-
      Operators rely on static recipes and rules-of-thumb; incremental setpoint
      optimization is slow and inconsistent across shifts, risking quality if
      pushed too aggressively.
    - >-
      Existing APC/controls focus on stability, not continuous energy-throughput
      optimization under explicit quality constraints (optical defects,
      thickness variation, stress/anisotropy).
    - >-
      Lehr settings (zone temperatures/speed) are typically conservative to
      avoid breakage, leaving throughput gains on the table and increasing
      annealing energy per ton.
    - >-
      Lack of unified, trustworthy M&V makes it hard to quantify savings, secure
      budget, or replicate wins across lines and plants.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across DCS/PLC, historian, QA systems; no operator-facing
      decision support that explains why a change is safe and what impact to
      expect.
  solution:
    - >-
      Secure data connectors to DCS/PLC/historians (OPC UA, PI, Aspen
      InfoPlus.21) for real-time pull, zone temperatures, boost, O2/fuel, lehr
      temps/speed, energy meters, QA and defect logs.
    - >-
      Multivariate drift detection models benchmark current operation vs.
      line-specific baselines normalized for pull, cullet ratio, batch
      chemistry, and ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML recommender produces safe, incremental setpoint
      advisories (e.g., ±2–5°C to specific zones, ±0.1–0.3% O2 trim, lehr
      ramp/speed changes), with predicted deltas on kWh/ton, CO2e/ton, pull, and
      risk to quality KPIs.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot UI: ranked recommendations with confidence, guardrails
      (ramp-rate limits, max deviation from qualified recipes), and one-click
      implementation notes for the DCS.
    - >-
      Sandbox “what-if” simulator using surrogate furnace/lehr models to test
      combined changes offline before live advisory.
    - >-
      Automated M&V using IPMVP Option C with CUSUM, normalizing for pull,
      cullet %, and product mix; monthly verified savings reports suitable for
      incentive programs/ETS.
    - >-
      Change management and audit trail: who accepted which suggestion,
      time-to-implement, resulting KPI shifts; feedback loops improve models.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Float glass plant managers and furnace/lehr engineers who want to cut
    kWh/ton and stabilize throughput without risking optical quality or ribbon
    stability.
  problem: >-
    Energy intensity drifts with batch/cullet mix, ambient swings, and aging
    refractories while manual tuning can’t keep up. Teams feel pressure to save
    energy but fear breakage or defects from aggressive moves. Wasting energy to
    make world‑class glass shouldn’t be the industry norm.
  guide: >-
    We’ve run hot ends and lehrs—so we design AI that respects furnace reality.
    Our process-first, physics-informed models and conservative constraints
    provide safe, operator-trusted advice backed by transparent reasoning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect read-only to historian/PLC to baseline energy and quality
    envelopes. 2) Calibrate models and guardrails; issue small, auditable
    setpoint recommendations (pull/temperature/lehr zones) with rationale and
    ramp limits. 3) Operators review/accept; weekly optimization reviews;
    continuous learning with quality-first constraints and human-in-the-loop
    control.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a feasibility assessment and single-line pilot using your data.
    Transitional: Request a live demo on historical runs and a savings/quality
    guardrail briefing.
  success: >-
    Lower kWh/ton and CO2, steadier ribbon and defect rates, maintained spec,
    incremental throughput gains within limits, fewer fire drills, and
    institutionalized best-practice playbooks across shifts with audit-ready
    results.
  failure: >-
    Energy and emissions continue creeping up, tuning remains tribal and
    reactive, operator load and risk rise, quality excursions threaten orders,
    and corporate targets slip.

      changes to cut kWh/ton while protecting glass quality.
    ctaText: Request a demo
    ctaHref: /request-demo
  problem:
    - 'Energy use drifts over time, raising kWh/ton without obvious alarms.'
    - Conservative setpoints leave savings and capacity on the table.
    - 'Manual tuning is slow, subjective, and risky for ribbon stability.'
    - 'Lehr profiles are rarely updated, causing over-annealing or bottlenecks.'
    - Plant data exists but isn’t converted into actionable setpoint guidance.
    - Proving changes safely requires shadow mode and clear guardrails.

      Continuously tracks energy-intensity against a live baseline to flag
      drift.
    - >-

      zones.
    - Optimizes for energy per ton while enforcing strict quality constraints.

      operation.
    - Multi-furnace benchmarking and campaign-aware models.
