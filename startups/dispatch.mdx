leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High cycle-time variability (30–60%) causes underutilized trucks; typical
      fleets lose 0.3–0.8 turns/truck/shift due to queueing and mis-sequenced
      loads.
    - >-
      Long dwell times at pit and jobsite (20–45 minutes per load) from batch
      plant surges, gate congestion, and paper processes.
    - >-
      On-time delivery performance often 70–85% for time-windowed loads
      (asphalt, concrete, DOT jobs), leading to penalties, production slowdowns,
      and change orders.
    - >-
      Manual dispatch via phone/text/email consumes 1 dispatcher per 25–40
      trucks; limited visibility to 3P haulers creates no-shows and late
      acceptances.
    - >-
      Paper/fragmented systems cause 1–3% revenue leakage via ticket mismatches,
      unbilled demurrage/detention, and disputes.
    - >-
      Route/weight/curfew non-compliance creates rework, fines, or rejected
      loads (not enforcing bridge weight limits, time-of-day bans, or seasonal
      road restrictions).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI Dispatch Engine: Optimizes assignment, sequencing, and routing of
      internal and 3P trucks against shifting plant/jobsite demand, time
      windows, HOS/short-haul rules, weight/road constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time Slotting & Gate Orchestration: Predictive queue management and
      load-time appointments to smooth arrivals/departures and prevent gate
      pileups.
    - >-
      ETA/Delay Prediction: ML models use traffic, weather, historical cycle
      data, and geofences to forecast cycle times and trigger proactive replans.
    - >-
      Driver & 3P Hauler Enablement: App/SMS workflows for accept/decline,
      geofenced auto-check-in/out, digital tickets, and bilingual prompts
      (EN/ES).
    - >-
      Integrations: Scale house (tickets/weights), telematics/ELD
      (location/HOS), order mgmt/ERP, asphalt/ready-mix production schedules,
      and eTicketing systems.
    - >-
      Compliance & Safety: Enforces weight-by-axle, bridge/route prohibitions,
      curfews, speed zones, and proof-of-delivery with auditable trace.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase truck turns by 10–25% and achieve >95% on-time delivery using
    AI-based dispatch, real-time slotting, and constraint-aware routing tailored
    to aggregates. Cut dwell 30–50%, reduce empty miles 8–15%, and lower
    fuel/CO2 5–12% while improving billing accuracy and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific optimization engine trained on millions of aggregate
    cycles and queue patterns, coupled with deep scale-house and telematics
    integrations that lower onboarding friction for mixed internal/3P fleets.
    Competitors either lack ML-based slotting, cannot optimize across multiple
    owners and marketplaces, or require heavy rip-and-replace of entrenched
    systems.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Aggregates producers (sand & gravel pits and quarries): operations
      managers, dispatch supervisors, scale house leaders.

      transfer, super tag) supplying producers and contractors.
    - >-
      Aggregates brokers/marketplaces coordinating 3P haulers and multi-site
      deliveries.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to aggregates producers and heavy civil contractors via
      regional account execs focused initially on TX, FL, GA, CA (high
      construction volumes).

      sponsor dispatch/operations tracks and present ROI case studies.
    - >-
      Targeted outbound to top 500 producers and top 200 heavy civil
      contractors; offer 60–90 day paid pilots with ROI guarantee.
    - >-

      reports, and site playbooks; PPC/LinkedIn targeting operations roles.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Who: Quarry, plant, and dispatch managers moving construction aggregates.
    Want: On‑time, low‑cost deliveries with maximum turns and clear
    pit‑to‑jobsite visibility.
  problem: >-
    External: Unpredictable orders, traffic, loader/scale queues, fragmented
    3PLs → late drops and idle time. Internal: Constant firefighting,
    radio/phone chaos, no live ETAs or clear slate for tomorrow. Philosophical:
    Moving rock shouldn’t be guesswork—every ton should arrive on time at the
    lowest possible cost.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived heavy‑haul ops and know the pain of missed windows,
    empty miles, and angry foremen. Authority: Built by logistics and quarry‑ops
    engineers using proven routing, queuing, and dispatch algorithms; integrates
    with telematics and scale/ERP systems; security‑first and field‑tested.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect orders, scale tickets, and GPS/ELD. 2) Configure rules
    (loader capacity, shift windows, priorities). 3) Go live with optimizer,
    dispatcher console, and driver app/SMS updates. Agreement: Keep your
    radios/phones; your data stays yours; start with a low‑risk single‑site
    pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute operations assessment or start a 2‑week pilot.
    Transitional: Run a savings/turns forecast and download the Dispatch
    Playbook.
  success: >-
    More turns per truck per day. Higher on‑time delivery with accurate ETAs.
    Shorter queues and dwell; reduced fuel and overtime. Balanced loader/scale
    utilization. Fewer coordination calls; happier drivers and customers. Lower
    cost per ton and stronger, more profitable bids.
  failure: >-
    Status quo chaos persists: late drops, idle trucks, long queues,
    over/under‑dispatch. Rising costs, driver churn, strained 3PL relationships.
    Lost jobs from unreliable delivery and avoidable penalties.
