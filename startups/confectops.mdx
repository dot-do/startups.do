  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly demand swings from promotions and holidays (e.g., Halloween,
      Valentine’s Day) cause stockouts of A-items and excess of long-tail SKUs;
      current forecasts are biased and lag promotions by 2–4 weeks.
    - >-
      Existing tools (ERP/MRP + spreadsheets) don’t generate feasible,
      finite-capacity schedules—ignoring changeovers, curing/panning times, and
      labor/tooling constraints—leading to last-minute expedites and overtime.
    - >-
      Shelf-life windows (gummies 9–12 months; hard candy 12–24 months;
      mints/lozenges 12–36 months) are not embedded in planning, causing 1–3% of
      sales lost to expiry/write-offs and excess safety stock.
    - >-
      Changeovers by flavor/color/allergen/gelatin type consume 10–25% of
      available time; poor sequencing amplifies cleaning/CIP and yields lower
      OEE.
    - >-
      Disconnected demand planning and production scheduling; S&OP plans are not
      executable at the plant-week level, creating plan vs. schedule gaps and
      low schedule adherence (<70–80%).
    - >-
      Limited scenario planning (promo uplift, new SKUs, capacity shocks)
      results in reactive decisions and missed service-level targets.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP, MES, WMS, and spreadsheets; planners spend
      hours on data wrangling instead of value-added planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data ingestion from ERP/MES/WMS (e.g., SAP, Oracle, NetSuite,
      Dynamics) for orders, BOMs, routings, capacities, inventory, promotions,
      and calendar constraints.
    - >-
      SKU-DC probabilistic forecasting using hierarchical Bayesian models +
      gradient boosting; specialized methods for intermittent demand;
      promo/price uplift with causal features; seasonal event templates
      (Halloween, holidays).
    - >-
      Shelf-life-aware inventory policy and target setting by SKU-family;
      coverage windows constrained by product stability (gummies 9–12m, hard
      candy 12–24m, mints/lozenges 12–36m).
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling via MILP/CP-SAT with multi-stage routing
      (cook/cool/pan/bag/case), curing room capacity, tooling/mold constraints,
      line speeds by SKU, labor skills/shift rules, and maintenance/CIP windows.
    - >-
      Changeover optimization using flavor/color/allergen/gelatin sequencing
      rules and setup matrices; campaign sizing to reduce cleans while meeting
      freshness windows.
    - >-
      Concurrent planning loop: forecasts drive DRP and capacity-feasible master
      schedule; schedule feedback updates demand feasibility, inventory
      projections, and service risk.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios for promos, new items, capacity shocks, and supplier
      delays; compare service, cost, overtime, and changeover impacts
      side-by-side.
    - >-
      Exception-based workflows with planner overrides, audit trails, and
      recommended actions for top drivers of service risk and expiry risk.
    - >-
      APIs and UI to publish planned orders to ERP/MRP, dispatch schedules to
      MES, and share dashboards with commercial/finance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific AI that unifies probabilistic SKU-DC demand forecasting with
    constraint-aware, finite-capacity weekly production scheduling for
    nonchocolate confectionery—explicitly modeling shelf life, changeovers,
    curing/panning, labor/tooling—and delivers a feasible plan in hours, not
    weeks. Expected outcomes: +2–5 pts service level, −15–30% changeover time,
    −20–40% expiry/write-offs, −10–20% inventories, −10–15% overtime within 3–6
    months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built optimization and forecasting stack trained on nonchocolate
    confectionery operational realities (shelf-life coverage, curing/panning
    constraints, allergen/color/flavor changeovers) plus proprietary changeover
    matrices and seasonal demand templates gathered from lighthouse
    deployments—enabling 8–12 week time-to-value and measurable KPI lifts that
    horizontal suites struggle to match.
