  problem:
    - >-
      Flavor trend cycles move faster than R&D and insights teams can respond,
      causing missed windows and copycat launches.
    - >-
      Concept testing with traditional agencies is slow (3–8 weeks) and
      expensive ($30k–$150k per study), stalling agile sprints.
    - >-
      Hit rates for new snack flavors are low; many launches fail to reach
      distribution targets due to weak early signal and poor fit to target
      cohorts.
    - >-
      Teams rely on anecdotal inputs (sales feedback, limited panels), producing
      biased or non-representative concept choices.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated view across social chatter, recipe trends, retail
      reviews, and panel testing leads to blind spots (e.g., regional and Gen Z
      micro-trends).
    - >-
      Insights aren’t reusable; learnings don’t compound across categories,
      claims, or seasons because there’s no shared ontology or norms.
    - >-
      Ingredient feasibility and regulatory constraints are considered too late,
      causing rework and sunk costs in R&D.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on trend mining from social, recipes, menus, reviews, and retail
      data to surface emerging flavor, ingredient, and claim patterns by cohort
      and region.
    - >-
      Automated concept card generation (name, descriptor, claims, use
      occasions, pack color cue) mapped to your brand guidelines and regulatory
      guardrails.
    - >-
      Rapid concept screening and in-depth validation with recruited target
      consumers using conjoint/TURF and purchase intent norms; results in 24–72
      hours.
    - >-
      Flavor-claim-pack combo optimization to identify the highest-lift
      combinations for target segments (e.g., Gen Z, wellness-focused).
    - >-
      Feasibility layer connects concepts to flavor house libraries and
      ingredient suppliers (allergens, cost-in-use, clean label), flagging risks
      early.
    - >-
      Scorecards and prioritized backlogs for R&D sprints with predicted trial,
      repeat intent, and distribution readiness.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: every test updates category norms and a proprietary
      flavor graph to improve next-round ideation and prediction.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From social pulse to go/no-go in 72 hours: AI generates on-brand flavor
    concepts from live consumer chatter and validates them via rapid online
    tests, improving hit rate and cutting concept costs by 50% vs. legacy
    agencies.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, continuously learning Flavor Graph linking flavors, claims,
    textures, colors, and occasions to predicted demand, enriched by closed-loop
    outcomes from hundreds of rapid tests and feasibility data from flavor
    houses—compounding accuracy and speed unavailable to generalist research
    platforms.
