  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime on loaders, case processors, presses, and packaging
      lines costs mid-market plants 5–15% of capacity, with typical OEE stuck at
      55–65%.
    - >-
      Failure modes (primer feed jams, bullet feeder misalignments, powder
      measure drift, case feed jams, conveyor motor failures) are detected late
      by operators, leading to extended line stops and elevated scrap.
    - >-
      Existing monitoring (PLC alarms, periodic vibration rounds) is reactive
      and not tailored to ammunition cycle signatures; general-purpose PdM tools
      require heavy configuration and produce too many false positives.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size manufacturers lack in-house data science/OT expertise
      to integrate PLC data, install sensors, and build maintainable ML models
      under ITAR/NIST-171 constraints.
    - >-
      Downtime and quality incidents create missed delivery dates and expediting
      costs during demand spikes, hurting service level and contract
      performance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge gateway pulls PLC tags (Allen-Bradley/Siemens) and fuses with
      vibration, current, vacuum, and vision-derived signals; auto-maps common
      loader/case-processor tag sets.
    - >-
      Unsupervised anomaly detection establishes per-asset baselines; supervised
      models learn labeled failure patterns (primer misfeeds, bullet seating
      drift, case cracks, conveyor motor overheating).
    - >-
      Predictive alerts with lead-time estimates (P90 lead time targeted at 1–4
      hours) and recommended actions (e.g., “inspect primer feed bowl and
      chute,” “replace sizer die,” “clear pack-out starwheel”).
    - >-
      Operator-first UI: line status, OEE, remaining useful life (RUL) widgets;
      mobile and andon alerts; one-click feedback (true/false alert) to retrain
      models.
    - >-
      CMMS integration (UpKeep, Fiix, eMaint) auto-creates work orders with
      parts lists; spare-parts forecasting for high-wear components.
    - >-
      Offline-capable edge (air-gapped optional) with secure sync; SOC 2 Type II
      controls and NIST 800-171-aligned deployment patterns.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard quantifying avoided downtime minutes, scrap avoided, and
      resulting throughput/cost savings.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Ammunition-specific predictive maintenance that learns the unique cycle
    signatures of loaders and presses to predict jams and wear 1–8 hours before
    failure, reducing unplanned downtime 25–40% and scrap 10–20%, with compliant
    on-prem/edge deployment for ITAR-sensitive environments and <30-day
    time-to-value.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Dataset and models tailored to ammunition production cycle signatures and
    failure modes, OEM tag templates for rapid integration, and a validated
    deployment pattern that meets ITAR/NIST-171 requirements—enabling accurate
    predictions with limited data and fast time-to-value that general PdM
    platforms struggle to match.
