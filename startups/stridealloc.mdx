leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Limited inventory must be split across overlapping retailer POs (by
      style/color/size) leading to suboptimal manual allocation and margin
      erosion.
    - >-
      Late or missing 855 acknowledgments trigger retailer chargebacks
      ($100–$250 per PO plus potential compliance score hits) and PO
      cancellations.
    - >-
      Inaccurate or generic backorder dates drive customer escalations, DC
      congestion, and fill-rate penalties.
    - >-
      Size-curve complexity and pack/carton constraints (pre-packs vs. open
      stock) are hard to balance vs. account priority, ship windows, and cancel
      dates.
    - >-
      Allocation decisions don’t incorporate live inbound ETAs, production
      slippage, or 3PL capacity, causing rework and 860 PO change loops.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/OMS ATP is SKU-level and timestamp-based, not constraint- or
      retailer-rule-aware at the size level (IA/IB/IC/IR per line).
    - >-
      High EDI mapping variability across retailers (e.g., Nordstrom, DSW,
      Amazon VC, Zappos, Foot Locker) makes automation brittle; internal EDI
      teams are bandwidth-constrained.
    - >-
      Manual allocation and 855 work consumes 1–3 FTEs for mid-sized wholesalers
      (100–1,000 POs/month), limiting scale during seasonal peaks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest 850 POs and ERP/WMS inventory and inbound POs
      (production/containers) to compute ATP/ATS at style-color-size with
      pack/carton constraints.
    - >-
      Apply configurable business rules and a learned allocation model to
      prioritize accounts, margins, and ship/cancel windows while honoring min
      packs, substitutions, and DC capacity.
    - >-
      Auto-generate 855 acknowledgments with per-line codes (IA accepted, IB
      backordered with projected date, IC partially accepted, IR rejected) and
      submit within retailer SLAs (typically <24–48 hours).
    - >-
      Predict backorder dates using supplier lead times, freight milestones
      (ASI/ETD/ETA, port dwell), and 3PL throughput; update via 860/855 change
      if conditions shift.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: human-in-the-loop approvals for strategic accounts,
      guardrails for minimum fill by PO, and automated what-if simulation before
      committing.
    - >-
      Compliance cockpit: SLA timers, 997/999 acceptance monitoring, chargeback
      risk scoring, root-cause analytics, and retailer-specific rule packs.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors for common ERPs (NetSuite, SAP B1, BlueCherry, A2000,
      ApparelMagic, Acctivate) and EDI networks (SPS, TrueCommerce, OpenText).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, retailer-compliant allocation and 855 issuance that confirms POs
    within hours, optimizes size-level fill across accounts, and predicts
    credible backorder dates—cutting 855-related chargebacks by up to 50% and
    boosting confirmed fill rates 3–8 points without increasing inventory.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Prebuilt retailer 855 packs and footwear-specific allocation heuristics
    (size curves, pack conversions) combined with ETA-aware backorder
    dating—plus partnerships with major EDI networks and ERP SIs—allow faster,
    more accurate confirmations than generic ERP ATP or rules engines. A growing
    dataset of retailer-specific acceptance patterns and chargeback triggers
    further improves outcomes and is difficult to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Footwear wholesale ops/EDI leaders who must confirm orders fast, hit
    retailer SLAs, and maximize scarce style-color-size inventory across
    incoming 850 POs.
  problem: >-
    PO demand outstrips ATP; spreadsheets and rigid ERP allocators can’t juggle
    size curves, cancel windows, and channel priorities. Late or inaccurate EDI
    855s cause chargebacks, cancellations, and damaged retailer scorecards.
  guide: >-
    We’ve lived footwear calendars, size runs, and big-box penalties. Our AI
    rules engine allocates in seconds and emits compliant EDI 855s with firm and
    backorder dates, integrated to your ERP/EDI and 3PL.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/EDI and set business rules (retailer priority, cancel dates,
    margin, size policies). 2) AI allocates limited inventory, runs scenarios,
    and issues 855s with confirmations and dated backorders. 3) You review
    exceptions, refine rules, and scale automation.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute allocation audit, or run a free sandbox on last month’s
    850s to see projected fill-rate lift and avoided chargebacks.
  success: >-
    Same-day 855 acknowledgments, higher fill rate and OTIF, fewer chargebacks,
    happier retailers, and reclaimed planner time. Clear backorder ETAs reduce
    cancellations and improve turns and revenue.
  failure: >-
    Without it, you keep firefighting spreadsheets, miss 855 windows, incur
    penalties, misallocate inventory, and lose shelf space and margin to faster
    competitors.
