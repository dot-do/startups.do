  title: Email Bounce Analysis and List Hygiene
  description: >-
    Analyze ESP bounce/complaint logs, classify issues, and produce
    suppression/remediation actions to boost deliverability.
  targetUsers:
    - Email Operations
    - List Managers
  triggers:
    - Campaign bounce rate > threshold
    - Spam complaint spike
    - ESP migration
  inputs:
    - 'ESP event logs (bounces, complaints, unsubscribes)'
    - Current suppression lists
    - Sending domains/IPs
  steps:
    - Ingest and normalize ESP events
    - >-
      Classify bounces (hard/soft/temporary) with rules + LLM for free-text
      reasons
    - 'Identify toxic domains, role accounts, traps'
    - Run mailbox verification on marginal cases
    - Recommend suppression and re-engagement strategy
    - Sync suppressions back to ESP
  tools:
    - Mailgun/SendGrid/Postmark APIs
    - ZeroBounce/NeverBounce
    - Google Postmaster Tools
    - LLM reason classifier
    - BigQuery/DuckDB
  outputs:
    - Hygiene report with root causes
    - Updated suppression lists
    - Per-domain recommendations (SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks)
  pricingModel:
    - Monthly retainer (tiers by event volume)
    - One-off cleanup fee per 10k events
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4
    overall: 5
  risks:
    - ESP API access limits
    - Misclassification of transient issues
    - Over-suppression hurting reach
  dependencies:
    - ESP API access
    - DNS records for checks (read-only)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High hard-bounce rates (often 3–15%) and spam complaints (>0.1%) trigger
      ESP throttling, blocklisting, and revenue loss for directory and mailing
      list publishers.
    - >-
      ESP- and MTA-specific bounce codes are inconsistent and opaque, making
      root-cause analysis slow and error-prone across SendGrid, Amazon SES,
      Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor, SFMC, Adobe Campaign, etc.
    - >-
      Manual list hygiene is reactive and risky—incorrect suppressions reduce
      list value; missed suppressions drive complaints and blocklist hits
      (Spamhaus, Proofpoint, Cloudmark).
    - >-
      Source-quality visibility is limited—publishers can’t easily tie
      bounces/complaints to list source, acquisition path, co-reg partner, or
      data broker feed.
    - >-
      Incident recovery is slow—lifting blocklists, unwarming IPs/domains, and
      rebuilding reputation can take weeks without standardized runbooks.
    - >-
      Regulatory/compliance exposure (CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR) increases with poor
      suppression workflows and incomplete FBL handling.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling—verification tools, deliverability dashboards, and
      internal exports don’t integrate, wasting analyst time and delaying
      actions.
    - >-
      Lack of outcome metrics—teams can’t quantify per-source inbox placement,
      RPME, and ROI post-remediation to guide inventory and pricing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified bounce/complaint ingestion via APIs, webhooks, and
      S3/BigQuery/Snowflake to normalize disparate ESP/MTA events into a single
      schema.
    - >-
      Proprietary bounce taxonomy that maps 1,000+ provider-specific codes into
      actionable root causes (invalid, policy, reputation, spam trap suspected,
      throttling, content, temp deferral).
    - >-
      AI classification to differentiate hard vs. soft/retryable issues and to
      detect trap-likely patterns, role accounts, disposables, typo domains, and
      risky sources.
    - >-
      Automated action engine that writes back suppressions to ESP/CRM, triggers
      address corrections (e.g., gmail.con→gmail.com), schedules retries, and
      recommends throttling or re-permissioning flows.
    - >-
      Source attribution that ties events to list source, campaign, form,
      vendor, or co-reg partner to rank sources by risk and ROI.
    - >-
      Blocklist and reputation monitoring (Spamhaus, Barracuda, Talos,
      Cloudmark, Microsoft SNDS, Gmail Postmaster) with playbook-driven incident
      response.
    - >-
      Warm-up/warm-back plans for domains/IPs with adaptive sending and
      engagement reactivation sequencing.
    - >-
      Compliance automation: FBL setup/monitoring (Yahoo, Comcast, Microsoft),
      compliant opt-out propagation, and audit-ready logs.
    - >-
      Outcome dashboards: inbox placement proxy signals, complaint/bounce
      trendlines, revenue per 1,000 sends (RPME), and per-source profitability.
    - >-
      Closed-loop testing: pre/post remediation A/Bs and cohort tracking to
      quantify incremental inbox, clicks, and revenue.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, cross-ESP bounce and complaint intelligence for directory and
    mailing list publishers that transforms raw logs into automated
    suppression/remediation actions—cutting hard bounces below 1–2%, keeping
    complaints under 0.1%, and protecting list value and inbox placement.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Industry-specific bounce taxonomy and source-risk models trained on
    multi-ESP, multi-publisher data; privacy-preserving cross-client pattern
    detection for trap networks and bad acquisition sources; and a closed-loop
    action engine that writes fixes back to ESPs/CRMs—turning insights into
    measurable deliverability and revenue gains with minimal manual effort.
