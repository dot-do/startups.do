  problem:
    - >-
      Ingredient cost volatility (sugar, glucose/tapioca syrups, gelatin,
      pectin, gum arabic, natural colors) causing 3–12% quarterly COGS swings
    - >-
      Supply disruptions and geopolitical risk (e.g., gum arabic from Sudan;
      citrus/pectin supply impacted by greening disease; EU/US regulatory shifts
      on colors like TiO2, Red #3) leading to stockouts or emergency
      reformulations
    - >-
      Lengthy reformulation cycles (4–12 weeks) to validate alternatives while
      maintaining texture (gel strength, chew), flavor, color, shelf life, and
      process compatibility
    - >-
      Fragmented data across PLM/ERP/quality systems; limited visibility to
      approved equivalent ingredients, supplier lead times, and true landed cost
    - >-
      Compliance and label-claim risks (vegan, halal/kosher, clean label,
      allergen-free, non-GMO, natural colors) slow decision-making and increase
      recall risk
    - >-
      Under-optimized BOMs: entrenched specs persist beyond price/availability
      changes; procurement and R&D incentives misaligned
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven alternative suggestions (e.g., gelatin→HM/LM pectin, blends with
      starch; carmine→beet/anthocyanins; corn syrup→tapioca/glucose blends;
      shellac→plant-based glazing) within label and allergen constraints
    - >-
      Digital twin for confectionery: predicts texture (gel strength, elastic
      modulus), Brix, pH window, water activity, glass transition, heat/humidity
      stability, and processability by equipment type
    - >-
      Real-time risk and cost scoring for each BOM: supplier concentration,
      country risk, lead time, price trend, spec equivalence, regulatory
      trajectory
    - >-
      One-click scenario planning: optimize for lowest cost, lowest risk, or
      balanced objective under user-defined constraints
    - >-
      Regulatory and claims engine: US, EU, CA rules; checks additives status
      (e.g., TiO2 in EU, CA AB418), allergen statements, vegan/halal/kosher
      feasibility, natural color definitions
    - >-
      Integration to PLM/ERP/LIMS to auto-match specs and push approved
      alternates to procurement workflows
    - >-
      Collaboration and audit trail: versioning, approver workflows,
      experimental design, and lab validation tracking
    - >-
      Supplier marketplace connectors: discover pre-qualified suppliers with
      compatible spec ranges and MOQs
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut ingredient COGS by 3–8% and reduce supply risk 25–50% in 90 days—without
    compromising label claims or sensory—by using an AI that proposes validated
    ingredient alternatives and runs in-silico trials with regulatory
    guardrails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    R&D, procurement, and QA leaders at nonchocolate confectionery makers
    (gummies, jellies, hard candy, marshmallow, licorice) responsible for
    formula integrity, cost, and continuity.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile prices, shortages, and changing regs make current
    formulas costly and fragile. Internal: fear that reformulation will harm
    taste/texture, claims, or throughput. Philosophical: candy makers shouldn’t
    have to trade consumer delight or compliance for margin.
  guide: >-
    We understand the risk of last‑minute reformulations and retailer audits.
    Our AI—trained on confectionery ingredient properties and
    regulations—surfaces safe, label‑compliant swaps (e.g.,
    gelatin→pectin/agar/carrageenan, colorant and syrup alternatives) with
    evidence of impact (6–12% COGS reduction; 30–50% lower stockout exposure).
  plan: >-
    1) Upload formulas/specs, claims, allergens, and sensory targets. 2) Set
    cost vs risk priorities and constraints. 3) Receive ranked
    alternative‑ingredient scenarios with cost/risk deltas, compliance checks,
    and sensory similarity scores. 4) Pilot, approve, and monitor; auto‑alerts
    on market or regulatory changes. Agreement: vendor‑neutral, audit‑ready
    docs; you retain final sign‑off.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 30‑minute feasibility call or start a 14‑day pilot on your
    top 3 SKUs. Transitional: download a sample risk report and ingredient risk
    heatmap.
  success: >-
    Resilient, label‑safe formulas that match sensory targets; diversified
    supply; protected margins; fewer stockouts and changeovers; faster
    approvals; audit‑ready documentation for regulators and retailers.
  failure: >-
    Margin erosion; stockouts and missed ship dates; failed sensory/claim
    checks; label/allergen violations; retailer penalties or delistings; wasted
    R&D cycles; loss of brand trust.
