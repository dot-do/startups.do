  title: Tech Pack Auto-Builder for Accessories
  description: >-
    Turn sketches/photos and a brief into complete, PLM-ready tech packs for
    belts, hats, gloves, bags, wallets, and trims.
  targetUsers:
    - Technical Designer
    - Product Developer
    - Freelance Designer
  triggers:
    - New style brief received
    - Designer uploads sketch or reference
  inputs:
    - Rough sketch/photos or CAD
    - Measurements or size specs
    - Material choices and trims
    - Brand construction standards/tolerances
    - Labeling/branding placement rules
  steps:
    - Detect components and construction details from images/brief
    - >-
      Draft BOM with materials, trims, thread, hardware; auto-calc yields where
      possible
    - Generate measurement chart and tolerance table by size
    - 'Auto-generate callouts, exploded views, and stitch details'
    - Export multi-page tech pack and push to PLM if connected
    - Human review and finalize with comments
  tools:
    - LLM with vision API
    - Adobe Illustrator scripting (CEP/UXP)
    - Excel/Google Sheets
    - Centric/WFX/Backbone PLM connectors (optional)
    - CLO3D/Blender (optional for 3D callouts)
  outputs:
    - Multi-page tech pack (PDF)
    - Illustrator/AI file with layers
    - BOM and measurements (CSV)
    - PLM-ready JSON/XML (if applicable)
  pricingModel:
    - Per style/SKU
    - Bundle per season
    - Subscription with monthly style credits
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Low-quality input images reduce accuracy
    - Factory-specific standards vary
    - IP concerns with reference images
  dependencies:
    - Brand standards/templates
    - Access to PLM (optional)
    - Material library (if available)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Accessory brands and factories spend 6–15 hours per SKU creating tech
      packs for belts, hats, gloves, bags, wallets, and trims, delaying sampling
      by 3–10 days.
    - >-
      Manual tech packs are error-prone: incomplete BOMs, missing construction
      details, and inconsistent measurements lead to 1–3 extra sample rounds and
      5–15% cost overruns.
    - >-
      Existing PLMs are generic or apparel-focused; accessory-specific libraries
      (buckles, clasps, zippers, interlinings, edge paint, reinforcements) are
      missing, forcing teams to rebuild specs from scratch.
    - >-
      Freelancers and agencies are expensive ($300–$1,200 per pack) and slow,
      with variable quality and limited factory acceptance.
    - >-
      Compliance and labeling (e.g., CPSIA/Prop 65 for accessories, REACH
      restricted substances, nickel release, care/labeling) are complex and
      often omitted, increasing risk of rework or legal exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parses sketches/photos to detect category
      (belt/hat/glove/bag/wallet/trim) and build a structured tech pack skeleton
      instantly.
    - >-
      Accessory-specific template engine generates measurements, graded size
      tables (where applicable), stitch/needle types, edge treatments,
      reinforcements, hardware placements, packaging, and labeling.
    - >-
      Vendor-linked BOM recommendations pull buckles, zippers, snaps, threads,
      edge paint, and interlinings from partnered catalogs (with SKU, finish,
      lead time).
    - >-
      Automated compliance prompts (CPSIA/Prop 65/REACH/nickel release) based on
      category, material, region; generates required labeling and testing notes.
    - >-
      Factory-ready outputs: PDF, XLSX, and PLM-ready JSON/XML for Centric,
      FlexPLM, Backbone, WFX, YuniquePLM; change logs and version control.
    - >-
      Cost lens: early cost estimate by material and hardware choices; flags
      high-risk cost drivers; suggests alternatives available in-region.
    - >-
      Collaboration: comment threads, redlines, and sample-request forms for
      factories; bilingual spec snippets (EN/ZH/VI) for clarity.
    - >-
      QC validator: checks incoming factory counter-samples/specs against the
      tech pack; highlights discrepancies to cut revision cycles.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn a sketch/photo and short brief into a factory-accepted, PLM-ready
    accessory tech pack in under 30 minutes—with auto-suggested BOMs from real
    hardware/material catalogs, built-in compliance checks, and measurable
    reductions in sample rounds and cost overrun.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary accessory dataset and live hardware/material catalogs
    tied to vendor SKUs—plus factory-validated templates and compliance rules
    that competitors lack—creates a defensible data moat and higher factory
    acceptance out of the box.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      SMB accessory brands (5–200 employees) producing 50–1,000 SKUs/year across
      belts, hats, gloves, bags, wallets, trims.

      Mid-market and enterprise apparel brands with accessory lines (outdoor,
      streetwear, luxury, corporate gifting) using PLM tools.
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Accessory brands, product developers, technical designers, and factory
    sample rooms (NAICS 315990) who need fast, accurate, PLM-ready tech packs
    for belts, hats, gloves, bags, wallets, and trims.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual tech packs are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone,
    causing sampling delays and factory confusion.

    - Internal: Pressure to hit calendars with lean teams; anxiety about costly
    mistakes and endless revisions.

    - Philosophical: Great accessories shouldn’t require mastering CAD or
    spending days on specs.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived accessory development and know where factories get
    stuck.

    - Authority: Accessory-trained AI plus hardware/material libraries and
    measurement standards, producing PLM-ready outputs trusted by brands and
    suppliers.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Upload a sketch/photo and brief or start from a template.

    - Step 2: AI builds the pack: BOM, construction, callouts, measurements,
    tolerances, stitch diagrams, trims/hardware, labeling, packaging, QC.

    - Step 3: Review, edit, and export to your PLM or share vendor-ready files.

    - Agreement: Clear pricing, versioned files, vendor-safe PDFs/CSVs; your
    data stays private.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start free trial; Upload a sketch; Book a 15‑min demo.

    - Transitional: Download a sample tech pack; Access accessory spec
    templates; Get the Tech Pack Quality Checklist.
  success: >-
    - Minutes to complete, PLM-ready tech packs; fewer sample rounds; cleaner
    factory handoffs; consistent brand standards; lower costs and faster
    seasons; traceable changes and vendor alignment.
  failure: >-
    - Avoid missed seasons, costly sampling cycles, mis-cut materials,
    chargebacks, compliance misses, and the Illustrator grind.
