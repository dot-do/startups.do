  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone processing of NDE reports (UT/RT/MT) consumes 10–30
      minutes per report; mid-size oilfield OEMs handle 5,000–20,000
      reports/year/site, equating to 1–6 FTEs of clerical QA time.
    - >-
      Traceability breaks across silos: NDE PDFs, scanned radiographs, weld maps
      in CAD/PDF, WPS/PQR in shared drives, and heat/MTRs from mills. Linking
      weld IDs to NDE results, WPS/PQR, welder ID, and heat numbers is slow and
      inconsistent.
    - >-
      Audit preparation for API Q1, API 6A/16A/17D, ASME IX/B31.3, ISO 9001
      8.5.2 often takes 2–6 weeks/site and causes shipment delays; missing
      traceability can trigger NCRs, rework, and liquidated damages.
    - >-
      Supplier and lab variability (different templates, units, languages,
      watermarking, poor scans) defeats generic OCR tools; DICONDE adoption is
      inconsistent; digital RT images, hand-written MT sketches, and UT
      spreadsheets coexist.
    - >-
      High cost of quality: paperwork-induced nonconformances, late customer
      documentation packages (BMR/MDR), and rework consume 0.5–1.5% of revenue
      at many shops.
    - >-
      Existing ERP/QMS/MES systems lack domain-specific extraction and
      weld-to-NDE-to-heat graph linking; bespoke macros and manual spreadsheets
      don’t scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multimodal document AI that extracts structured data from UT/RT/MT reports
      (PDF, image, spreadsheet), including DICONDE DR/CR metadata and
      attachments, with human-in-the-loop validation for critical fields.
    - >-
      Computer-vision weld map digitization: recognize spool/assembly drawings,
      callouts, weld IDs, and geometry; auto-align NDE results to weld
      locations.
    - >-
      Standards-aware linkage engine: connect WPS/PQR, welder ID/continuity,
      material certs (EN 10204 3.1/3.2 MTRs), heat numbers, base/filler metals,
      and PWHT to each weld; flag gaps against ASME IX/API 6A rules.
    - >-
      Traceability graph and audit pack builder: one-click generation of MDR/BMR
      packages with complete chain of custody, e-signatures, revision history,
      and acceptance criteria status.
    - >-
      Connectors to SAP/Oracle/Infor/Epicor, Siemens Opcenter/Teamcenter,
      Hexagon/AVEVA, and common lab portals; secure APIs and on-prem or VPC
      deployment options.
    - >-
      Quality analytics: dashboards for weld/NDE throughput, reject rates by
      process, lab, welder, and material; early warning on paperwork bottlenecks
      and recurring NCR root causes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-trained AI that turns unstructured UT/RT/MT reports, weld maps,
    WPS/PQR, and MTRs into a validated, end-to-end digital traceability
    graph—achieving >95% auto-link of welds to NDE and heats, cutting audit-prep
    time by 80–90%, and reducing documentation handling cost by 60–75% within 90
    days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specialized, continuously expanding library of NDE/weld map/MTR
    templates and acceptance rules—plus weld-map CV models and a purpose-built
    traceability graph—reduces onboarding of new suppliers and labs from weeks
    to days. Relationships with major NDE labs and prebuilt ERP/PLM connectors
    shorten enterprise time-to-value and create high switching costs.

  character: >-
    QA/NDE managers and welding engineers in oil & gas field machinery
    manufacturing (NAICS 333132) who must deliver code-compliant weld
    traceability under tight schedules.
  problem: >-
    External: NDE PDFs, weld maps, WPS/PQR, and heat numbers sit in silos;
    manual cross-referencing is slow and error-prone. Internal: teams worry
    about audit exposure, NCRs, and late shipments. Philosophical: traceability
    should be automatic, accurate, and audit-ready.
  guide: >-
    We understand API/ASME shop realities and audit pressure. Our AI and
    workflows have processed thousands of UT/RT/MT reports, linking indications
    to weld IDs, WPS/PQR, and heat numbers with high accuracy—backed by secure
    deployment and human-in-the-loop QA.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect sources (UT/RT/MT reports, weld maps, WPS/PQR, MTRs/heat logs).
    2) AI parses, normalizes, and links data to weld IDs and coverage per
    ITP/code. 3) Review flagged items, approve. 4) Export audit-ready
    traceability packs to ERP/PLM. SLAs, security, and change control included.

    the Traceability Readiness Checklist and sample digital weld dossier.
  success: >-
    Complete, verifiable traceability from heat to weld to NDE to final
    acceptance; faster ITP closeout, fewer NCRs, one-click audit packs, and
    on-time delivery with higher confidence.
  failure: >-
    Without this, spreadsheets proliferate, linkages are missed, rework
    increases, audits find gaps, shipments slip, and margins erode.

  problem:
    - Manual entry from UT/RT/MT PDFs and scans is slow and error‑prone.
    - >-
      Weld maps, WPS/PQR, MTRs, and NDE reports live in silos—traceability
      breaks.
    - Compiling MDR/DMR turnover packages consumes days per job.
    - >-

    - >-
      Automated validation: missing NDE, expired WPS, continuity gaps, MTR
      mismatches.
    - 'Heat‑to‑joint trace matrix: heat → material → weld → NDE → disposition.'
    - >-
      MTR ingestion with EN 10204 3.1/3.2 support and chemistry/mech properties
      capture.
    - Level II/III review workflow with e‑signatures and full audit trail.

      Flexible deployment: secure cloud, VPC, or on‑prem with data residency
      options.
  steps:
    - 'Connect your sources: drag‑and‑drop PDFs or link SharePoint/Email.'
    - Upload weld maps and weld ID lists; define mapping rules.
    - 'Import WPS/PQR, welder quals, and material master with heat numbers.'
    - AI parses UT/RT/MT reports and proposes weld links and dispositions.
