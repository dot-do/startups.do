leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High travel time and congestion in pick paths increase labor cost by
      20–40% in manual and hybrid DCs.
    - >-
      Static slotting becomes obsolete within weeks due to seasonality,
      promotions, and new SKU introductions, causing 10–20% productivity decay
      over a quarter.
    - >-
      Replenishment thresholds are often rule-of-thumb, triggering late or
      excess replenishments, leading to 1–4 percentage-point loss in fill rate
      and overtime.
    - >-
      Existing WMS slotting modules require heavy IT projects, are batch-only,
      or lack multi-objective optimization (labor, space, replen, safety),
      limiting adoption.
    - >-
      Operations lack a safe way to simulate slot changes and quantify ROI
      before executing moves, creating organizational resistance.
    - >-
      3PLs need client-specific value proof and rapid wins to include
      optimization fees in contracts; without clear KPIs, initiatives stall.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dynamic slotting engine that reassigns SKUs to optimal locations based on
      demand velocity, affinity, cube/weight, pick method, and congestion
      models.
    - >-
      Adaptive replenishment thresholds (min/max, safety stock) using demand
      volatility, lead time, and service targets to reduce late/urgent tasks.
    - >-
      Near-real-time micro-move recommendations (e.g., hot picks to golden zone)
      plus weekly re-slot waves respecting labor windows and constraints.
    - >-
      Digital twin simulator to A/B test slotting/replenishment scenarios before
      execution; quantifies travel-time, touches, and service impact.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: publish tasks directly to WMS/WES; track compliance
      and automatically re-plan when tasks are skipped or delayed.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly UX: ranked recommendations with reason codes, move
      effort, expected benefit, and safety/OSHA checks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously optimized slot assignments and replenishment thresholds that
    cut picker travel and late replenishments, delivering 8–15% labor savings
    and a 1–3 point fill-rate lift within 90 days—without replacing your WMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic, real-time slotting and replenishment engine with a
    simulation-first workflow and a library of proven WMS connectors that
    deliver measurable savings in under 90 days; learning across sites enables
    robust cold-start and seasonality handling, while governance and safety
    controls reduce operational resistance.
