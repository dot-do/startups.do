leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Static gas‑lift setpoints become suboptimal as reservoir pressure, water
      cut, and facility loading change, causing 2–8% lost oil and 5–25% excess
      injection gas per well versus achievable performance.
    - >-
      Engineers spend 6–12 hours/week per asset manually tuning 50–200 wells via
      trial‑and‑error; changes are episodic (weekly/monthly), not continuous.
    - >-
      Facility and compressor constraints (HP, MAWP, separator/liquids handling,
      emissions/flare permits) are not co‑optimized across wells, leading to 2–6
      gas‑shortage events/month and unfair or ad hoc gas allocation.
    - >-
      Lack of closed‑loop guardrails increases operational risk, so teams adopt
      overly conservative setpoints; setpoint drift and undocumented changes
      complicate audits and MOC.
    - >-
      Existing tools trend data and detect anomalies but do not deliver
      constraint‑aware, prescriptive setpoint recommendations across
      wells/facilities in near real time.
    - >-
      Data silos and historian latency (15–60 min) hinder optimization; poor
      sensor quality (5–10% tags) degrades confidence in manual decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Secure historian/SCADA integration (OSIsoft PI/Aveva, Cygnet, Ignition,
      OPC UA/Modbus); ingest rates, pressures, temps, choke/valve positions,
      compressor status, flaring/emissions, alarms.
    - >-
      Build physics‑informed surrogate models per well (IPR/VLP and gas‑lift
      response curves) calibrated from history and safe, automated micro
      step‑tests; detect slugging/instability and sensor drift.
    - >-
      Run a multi‑objective optimizer that allocates injection gas across wells
      subject to compressor HP, line pressure, facility liquids throughput,
      MAWP, emissions permits, and contractual gas availability to maximize net
      barrels ($/day).
    - >-
      Deliver ranked setpoint recommendations with expected deltas (bopd,
      Mscf/d, $/day), confidence bands, and guardrails; batch or streaming
      advisories to control room and engineers.
    - >-
      Optional limited‑authority autopilot via DCS/PLC with interlocks,
      rate‑of‑change limits, and automatic rollback; full MOC and audit trail.
    - >-
      A/B testing framework: randomized or staggered trials with counterfactual
      modeling and uplift measurement; weekly reports to validate impact and
      guide expansion.
    - >-
      SRE monitoring, data‑quality scoring, model drift detection, and SLA;
      one‑click pause/rollback and safe re‑optimization on constraint changes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase oil 2–5% and cut injection gas 5–15% with a constraint‑aware,
    physics+ML optimizer that recommends (or safely auto‑applies) gas‑lift
    setpoint changes every 5–15 minutes while honoring well integrity and
    facility limits. Deploy via historian connectors in 4–6 weeks with <90‑day
    payback.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Facility‑aware, constraint‑first optimizer that safely reallocates injection
    gas across wells in real time, combining physics‑informed models, live
    compressor curves, and emissions limits. Pre‑built historian/SCADA
    connectors cut integration to days, and a large library of curated gas‑lift
    step tests accelerates calibration and improves accuracy from day one. A
    safety case and MOC playbook streamline approvals for advisory and
    limited‑authority autopilot.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production and operations engineers at upstream oil producers running
    gas‑lift wells who must hit oil targets without exceeding compressor, line,
    or flaring limits.
  problem: >-
    Manual, once‑a‑day setpoint changes can’t keep up with changing reservoir
    and facility conditions. Over/under‑injection wastes gas, trips compressors,
    and leaves barrels in the ground. Teams lack a trustworthy, constraint‑aware
    recommendation engine.
  guide: >-
    We’re petroleum engineers and AI practitioners who understand field
    realities and facility limits. We deliver a transparent, physics‑informed
    optimization service that respects hard constraints, integrates with SCADA,
    and keeps engineers in the loop.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data (SCADA/historian, well metadata, facility limits). 2)
    Calibrate per‑well response and constraints. 3) Run shadow mode to prove
    value. 4) Go live with human‑approved setpoint recommendations and alerts.
    5) Review KPIs and refine guardrails.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 60‑day pilot on 5–20 gas‑lift wells to quantify uplift and gas
    savings.
  success: >-
    Consistently higher oil, lower gas per barrel, fewer trips and flaring
    events, steadier wells, and audit‑ready recommendations that honor
    compressor and line constraints—without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Keep leaving barrels behind, burning excess gas, tripping equipment, and
    firefighting with manual setpoint tweaks.
