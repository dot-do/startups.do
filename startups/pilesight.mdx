  title: Stockpile Volume Measurement (Drone Upload)
  description: >-
    Process client-uploaded drone photos into orthomosaics/DEMs and compute
    stockpile volumes and tonnage with QA review.
  targetUsers:
    - Plant Managers
    - Inventory/Accounting
    - Surveyors
  triggers:
    - Monthly inventory
    - Pre-audit/quarter-end
    - Post-storm reshaping
  inputs:
    - Geotagged drone photos (with flight logs)
    - GCPs/scale bars (optional)
    - Pile polygons (optional)
    - Material densities (lb/ft³ or t/m³)
  steps:
    - Run photogrammetry to create orthomosaic/DSM
    - Auto-segment piles; allow manual edits
    - Compute volumes vs base/reference plane
    - Apply densities to estimate tonnage
    - QA check and versioned export; compare vs last survey
  tools:
    - OpenDroneMap or Pix4D/cloud alternative
    - PDAL/CloudCompare
    - QGIS
    - S3/Web uploader
  outputs:
    - 'CSV per pile (volume, tonnage)'
    - 3D model/orthomosaic tiles
    - Pile outlines (GeoJSON)
    - Change report vs previous period
  pricingModel:
    - Per-survey processing fee (tiered by image count)
    - Optional monthly subscription for recurring sites
  humanInLoop: true

    remoteOnLaptop: 8
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Poor flight overlap/GCP quality reduces accuracy
    - Large uploads/time to process
    - Density assumptions may differ from reality
    - Use for financials may require licensed surveyor sign-off
  dependencies:
    - Client-captured imagery
    - Density table
    - Pile IDs/locations

  problem:
    - >-
      Aggregates producers and quarries must track stockpile volumes and tonnage
      for inventory, reconciliation, and financial reporting but traditional
      surveying is costly, slow, and dangerous.
    - >-
      Drone imagery is increasingly available, but turning photos into accurate,
      audit-ready volumes requires expertise in photogrammetry, pile
      segmentation, and QA that most sites lack.
    - >-
      Existing software often locks users into specific hardware or
      subscriptions, with variable accuracy and long turnaround times; many
      teams still rely on manual estimates leading to 5–15% inventory errors.
    - >-
      Finance and operations need traceable, repeatable results with density,
      moisture, and pile boundary assumptions documented for audits and
      month-end close.
    - >-
      Site managers need actionable insights (change detection, cycle time
      impacts) rather than just a volume number; current tools provide limited
      workflows and ERP integration.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve upload portal: clients upload geotagged drone photos (RGB) and
      ground control files (optional).
    - >-
      Automated photogrammetry pipeline to generate orthomosaics and DEMs;
      AI-based pile detection/segmentation and toe extraction.
    - >-
      Per-pile volume and tonnage with density/moisture library and
      site-specific defaults; confidence intervals and quality score for each
      pile.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA on every job; flagged issues with corrective
      recommendations (e.g., flight path gaps, low overlap).
    - >-
      Deliverables: orthomosaic/DEM, per-pile CSV, reconciliation PDF,
      shapefiles/GeoJSON, and API/webhook to ERP or BI tools.
    - >-
      Change detection between surveys (cut/fill, shrink/swell), variance vs.
      scalehouse and ERP.
    - >-
      Compliance/Audit trail: parameters, inputs, and review steps logged and
      exportable.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Accurate, audit-ready stockpile volumes and tonnage from your drone photos
    in under 24 hours—with human QA, ERP-ready exports, and no hardware lock-in.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Aggregates-tuned AI with human QA on every job, a proprietary flight QC and
    confidence scoring system, and deep ERP reconciliation workflows that
    convert measurements into audit-ready inventory with traceable
    assumptions—delivering reliable month-end close without hardware lock-in.

  character: >-
    Operations and inventory managers at construction sand and gravel mines
    (NAICS 212321) who need fast, accurate stockpile volumes and tonnage without
    disrupting production.
  problem: >-
    Manual or infrequent surveys are slow, risky, and inconsistent—leading to
    write‑offs, disputes, and missed targets. They need defensible numbers, not
    guesswork, because million‑dollar decisions shouldn’t rely on estimates.
  guide: >-
    We know mine‑site inventory pressure. Our AI + geospatial team processes
    drone imagery into survey‑grade orthomosaics and DEMs, with human QA by
    experienced reviewers and proven photogrammetry workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload drone photos and site notes. 2) We build orthomosaics/DEMs,
    delineate piles, and compute volumes and tonnage using your material
    densities. 3) QA review, then deliver PDF reports, CSVs, and CAD/shape files
    in 24–72 hours. Simple per‑site pricing, no long‑term contracts.
  callToAction: >-
    Start now by uploading a flight or book a 15‑minute demo. Pilot your first
    site with QA acceptance guaranteed.
  success: >-
    Audit‑ready inventories, safer crews, and tighter reconciliation and
    forecasting. Save days each cycle, cut variance, and make confident
    production and purchasing decisions.
  failure: >-
    Keep overpaying or under‑reporting material, expose crews to hazardous
    survey work, and continue disputes and missed cash and production targets.
