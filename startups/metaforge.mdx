    - genre/mood classification and keywords
    - write ID3/RIFF tags
    - validate/export DDEX ERN or CSV/XML

  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent and incomplete metadata (BPM, key, mood, genre,
      instrumentation) causes poor searchability and lower sync/streaming
      performance.
    - >-
      Manual tagging is slow (3–6 minutes/track) and expensive
      ($0.40–$1.50/track) with high inter-annotator variance.
    - >-
      High DSP rejection rates due to DDEX schema errors, invalid identifiers
      (ISRC/UPC/ISNI/IPI), and poor QC increase time-to-market by days or weeks.
    - >-
      Catalog owners lack fingerprinting and audio ID linkage across platforms
      (YouTube, TikTok, UGC, broadcasters), leading to missed claims and
      royalties.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling across ID3 tags, DDEX ERN/MEAD, and internal schemas
      creates duplication and data drift.
    - >-
      Back-catalog clean-up and ongoing metadata governance are under-resourced,
      leading to conflicting versions and vendor lock-in.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size libraries/labels lack in-house engineering to integrate
      DDEX, ID mapping, and feature extraction pipelines.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven feature extraction for BPM (±1), musical key, mood, genre,
      energy/valence, instruments, explicitness, language detection, stems
      presence.
    - >-
      Audio fingerprint generation and matching; connectors to third-party
      registries (e.g., ACRCloud/BMAT/Pex) for cross-platform ID linking.
    - >-
      Schema-aware DDEX packaging: ERN 4.x deliveries, MEAD 1.x descriptive
      metadata, RIN import-to-MEAD mapping, plus ID3 v2.4 tagging at file level.
    - >-
      Automated validations: identifier checks (ISRC/UPC/ISNI/IPI),
      rights-holdership sanity checks, territory/rights windowing, and DDEX
      schema conformance.
    - >-
      Batch back-catalog clean-up toolkit: dedupe detection, conflict
      resolution, and confidence scoring for metadata merges.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review UI for exceptions; active learning loop improves
      models on customer data over time.
    - >-
      APIs/SDKs and no-code dashboard; S3/GCS/Azure Blob watchers for hands-free
      ingestion and export to DSPs/partners.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One API to auto-enrich audio metadata and deliver error-free DDEX/ID3
    packages—cut tagging cost by 60–80%, slash DSP rejections to <1%, and reduce
    time-to-release from days to minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from real DSP rejection feedback and retailer rule
    changes, combined with proprietary labeled catalogs from integration
    partners—enabling higher DDEX pass rates and more accurate tagging than
    competitors who lack continuous ground-truth signals.
  customerSegments:
    - Production music libraries and sync houses (10k–5M tracks/catalog).
    - >-
      Independent labels and label services using DDEX to deliver to DSPs
      (50k–10M tracks).
    - >-

      API).
    - >-
      SFX libraries and audio post houses requiring rich tagging for search and
      edit workflows.
    - >-
      Archival/heritage institutions digitizing catalogs needing compliant
      metadata for distribution and discovery.
    - >-
      Podcast networks and audiobook producers needing ID3/DDEX-like packaging
      and mood tagging for discoverability.
    - >-
      Rights administrators and music publishers needing descriptive MEAD
      enrichment to complement works data.

  character: >-
    Music labels, production libraries, and post‑audio teams (NAICS 512290) who
    need delivery‑ready masters and truly searchable catalogs.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual tagging, messy metadata, and changing DDEX/ingestion specs
    cause rejections and delays. Internal: Teams feel buried in admin work and
    worry revenue leaks through bad data. Philosophical: Creators shouldn’t lose
    time or money because metadata is hard.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve delivered to major DSPs and know the pain of failed
    ingestions. Authority: Built by music‑tech veterans; trained on industry
    datasets; validates against DDEX ERN/MEAD and partner profiles; secure,
    privacy‑first architecture.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect your catalog via S3/FTP/API and select partner profiles,
    2) AI enriches (BPM/key/mood/genre), fingerprints, and auto‑builds DDEX/ID3,
    3) Review, approve, and export delivery‑ready packages. Agreement: No‑code
    dashboard + API, human‑in‑the‑loop QC, audit trail & versioning, zero‑commit
    pilot, no model training on your audio without opt‑in.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20‑minute demo to start your pilot. Transitional: Upload up
    to 50 tracks for a free enrichment report and DDEX sample pack.
  success: >-
    Clean, rich metadata; one‑click DDEX/ID3 packages; faster deliveries; fewer
    rejections; accurate credits and splits; better search and placements;
    reliable royalty reporting; scalable ops.
  failure: >-
    Stalled releases, failed ingestions, rights conflicts, takedowns,
    duplicates, missed deadlines, lost licensing revenue, and burned team time.
