  problem:
    - >-
      Ocean schedules remain volatile (weather, port congestion, strikes, canal
      restrictions, blank sailings), yet shippers and forwarders receive
      disruption notices late or not at all.
    - >-
      Operations teams spend 10–30 minutes per disrupted shipment chasing
      updates across carrier portals, emails, AIS maps, and TMS, delaying
      customer communication.
    - >-
      Customers receive generic, non-actionable delay emails; alternatives
      (reroutes, mode shifts) are not proposed in time to protect OTIF and
      inventory positions.
    - >-
      Current TMS/visibility tools surface events but lack shipment-level
      prioritization by business impact and automated, targeted communication
      workflows.
    - >-
      Rerouting decisions are ad hoc; cost/speed/CO2 tradeoffs are not
      quantified quickly enough to secure space and mitigate downstream costs
      (detention/demurrage, stockouts, expedites).
  solution:
    - >-
      Disruption detection engine that fuses carrier events (EDI/API), AIS, port
      congestion, and schedule reliability to predict ETA slippage and missed
      transshipments 24–72 hours before official notices.
    - >-
      Priority scoring that ranks impacted shipments by revenue, SKU
      criticality, PO/launch dates, SLA, and inventory risk pulled from ERP/TMS.
    - >-
      Automated comms composer that drafts customer-ready updates with root
      cause, new ETA, and approved alternatives; routes for human approval where
      needed; supports multi-lingual output.
    - >-
      Alternative routing generator that compares same-carrier rebooks,
      transshipment changes, carrier switches, LCL split, or partial air uplift;
      quantifies time, cost, and CO2 deltas.
    - >-
      Workflow and policy rules to control thresholds, approvals, and who gets
      notified via email, SMS/WhatsApp, Slack/Teams, or a branded portal.
    - >-
      Closed-loop analytics showing lead time advantage vs carrier notices,
      acceptance of alternatives, cost avoidance, and customer satisfaction.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect ocean schedule disruptions earlier, prioritize by business impact,
    and automatically craft targeted customer updates with viable alternative
    routings—cutting exception handling time by 70%, reducing expedite/detention
    by 10–20%, and improving OTIF by 2–5 points.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop system that links early disruption predictions with
    outcome-labeled communications and accepted alternatives, producing a unique
    dataset that improves both detection and conversion over time; plus deep
    integrations into operators’ daily systems and a proven template library
    that cuts human effort while preserving brand tone.

    monitors schedules, AIS, and carrier advisories to detect disruptions and
    prepares targeted shipper updates and viable alternative routings.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect schedules, AIS, TMS/booking, and customer lists. 2) Set lanes,
    SLAs, tone, and approval rules. 3) Receive disruption alerts with
    ready‑to‑send messages and routing options; approve or auto‑dispatch.
  callToAction: Start a 14‑day pilot or book a 30‑minute demo.
  success: >-
