leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Revenue leakage from ticketing errors and fraud (misloads, duplicate
      tickets, pricing misapplication) commonly costs 0.3%–1.0% of revenue for
      sand and gravel producers.
    - >-
      Manual audits are sporadic and miss subtle, cross-system anomalies (e.g.,
      mismatched product-to-order, off-contract pricing, void/credit abuse).
    - >-
      Scale house and ERP systems provide basic validations but lack cross-site,
      cross-day, and cross-source anomaly detection and reconciliation.
    - >-
      Operations teams are overloaded; exceptions discovered weeks later are
      hard to recover and erode customer trust.
    - >-
      Fragmented data across scale software, dispatch, ERP, and hauler systems
      makes daily reconciliation time-consuming and error-prone.
    - >-
      Fraud vectors (duplicate or “ghost” tickets, after-hours loads, license
      plate swaps) are difficult to detect without telemetry/camera signals and
      ML.
    - >-
      Inconsistent master data (price lists, product codes, hauler IDs) drives
      invoicing mistakes and write-offs.
    - >-
      Mid-market producers lack in-house data science resources to build and
      maintain robust anomaly detection pipelines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest scale tickets and related data (orders,
      contracts/price lists, customer/hauler master, voids/credits, dispatch,
      telemetry, LPR/RFID) via API, DB connectors, or SFTP.
    - >-
      Run a layered detection stack: deterministic rules (e.g.,
      duplicate/time-window checks), statistical baselines
      (per-site/hauler/product norms), and ML models for product mix, weight
      patterns, and price compliance.
    - >-
      Automated reconciliation: tie each ticket to an order/contract, validate
      price/terms, confirm product-to-order fit, and match truck IDs/tare
      patterns.
    - >-
      Real-time alerts and daily exception queues prioritized by dollar risk and
      likelihood-of-error; workflows to accept, remediate, or escalate.
    - >-
      Push corrections to ERP/invoicing or generate credit/debit memos with full
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Dashboards: leakage by site/hauler/customer, top anomaly classes, recovery
      run-rate, SLA and throughput metrics.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop feedback improves precision/recall site-by-site within
      30–60 days.
    - >-
      Security-first delivery (SOC 2 roadmap), role-based access, PHI/PII
      minimization, and data retention controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover 0.3%–0.8% of revenue and cut ticket QA time by 70% with AI-driven
    reconciliation that flags high-dollar anomalies within minutes, not
    weeks—backed by performance-based pricing and a 30-day proof-of-value.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built ticket-graph anomaly model trained on multi-site aggregates
    data and enriched with telemetry/LPR signals, combined with deep, certified
    connectors to leading scale/ERP systems and a performance-based,
    proof-of-value motion that incumbents and generalist BI tools struggle to
    match.
