  problem:
    - >-
      Rice farmers and aggregators cannot quickly quantify poor stand
      establishment and gaps (10–30% of area in some fields), leading to delayed
      or missed re-sowing windows (7–21 days after transplanting/direct
      seeding).
    - >-
      Persistent monsoon cloud cover blocks optical satellites; manual scouting
      is slow, fragmented, and biased, causing high false negatives on early
      emergence failures.
    - >-
      Yield penalties from patchy stands commonly range 5–20% when gaps exceed
      10–15% of field area; there is no low-cost, scalable system to localize
      gaps and estimate avoidable yield loss.
    - >-
      Current advisory systems are generic; they do not combine SAR+optical data
      with rice phenology to generate field-level, sub-field prescriptions for
      re-sowing and management.
    - >-
      Aggregators, mills, and insurers lack standardized, auditable stand
      metrics to trigger interventions, subsidies, or claims, increasing
      operational risk and basis risk.
    - >-
      Smallholders often lack smartphones or connectivity; insights must be
      delivered via low-tech channels (SMS/IVR) and integrated into existing
      extension and coop workflows.
    - >-
      Farmers and enterprises lack a clear ROI calculator linking early gap
      detection to re-sowing costs, saved yield, and risk-adjusted profit.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse SAR (e.g., Sentinel-1) with optical imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2;
      optional 3 m data) to generate field-level stand establishment and gap
      heatmaps 7–21 days after transplanting/direct seeding.
    - >-
      Rice-specific phenology models to distinguish water, weeds, transplant
      shock, and early growth, improving precision under monsoon/cloud
      conditions.
    - >-
      Automated prescriptions: gap polygons, recommended re-sowing windows, seed
      rate suggestions, and cost-benefit (ROI) calculator.
    - >-
      Multi-channel delivery: API for partners; dashboard for agronomists;
      SMS/WhatsApp/IVR for farmers in local languages.
    - >-
      Operational triggers for partners (mills, insurers, drone providers): SLAs
      and webhooks to dispatch re-sowing or advisory visits.
    - >-
      Impact analytics: estimate yield-at-risk, action adoption tracking, and
      season-over-season benchmarking for programs and enterprise reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Actionable, monsoon-proof stand establishment and gap maps for rice within
    48 hours of satellite acquisition, using SAR+optical fusion and rice
    phenology models to localize re-sowing zones, quantify avoidable yield loss,
    and trigger service providers—delivering 5–15% yield preservation at <$2/ha
    per season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rice-specific, multi-country dataset and SAR+optical fusion models
    validated under monsoon/cloud conditions, combined with a partner network
    (mills, insurers, drone services) that can act within the re-sowing
    window—closing the loop from detection to action and measured ROI.
    Season-over-season impact data compounds model performance and trust.

    Rice growers, farm managers, and agronomy advisors who want uniform,
    high-yield rice stands from day zero.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Invisible stand gaps and a fast-closing re-sowing window.

    - External: Patchy germination and transplant gaps go undetected early;
    manual scouting is slow and inconsistent.

    - Internal: Teams lack confidence on when and where to re-sow or adjust
    management.

    - Philosophical: No farmer should lose yield because stand gaps stay
    invisible from the ground.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the re-sowing window is narrow and cloudy, flooded
    fields make scouting hard.

    - Authority: Built by rice agronomy and SAR/optical analytics experts;
    workflows designed with agronomist input.
  plan: >-
    1) Add fields (upload polygons or connect your farm system).

    2) Shortly after seeding/transplanting, receive SAR/optical stand maps, gap
    heatmaps, and alerts.

    3) Act: re-sow/spot-seed flagged zones or adjust water/inputs; verify
    improvements with follow-up scans.

    - No hardware; SAR works through clouds; secure data and clear per-hectare
    pricing.
  callToAction: |-
    - Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot this season.
    - Transitional: Download a sample stand map and gap report.
  success: >-
    - Uniform, well-established rice stands from day zero.

    - Timely re-sowing and targeted management instead of whole-field rework.

    - Higher yield potential, lower input waste, and fewer weeds from early
    gaps.

    - Auditable maps to document decisions and sustainability outcomes.
  failure: |-
    - Missed re-sowing window and avoidable yield loss.
    - Wasted seed and fertilizer in thin patches; increased weed pressure.
    - Uneven maturity, harvest losses, and higher rework costs.
