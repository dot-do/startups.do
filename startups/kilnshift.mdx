  problem:
    - >-
      Energy cost volatility and high demand charges: Electricity prices and
      demand charges account for 20–50% of plant utility bills; demand charges
      can be $10–30/kW-month and transmission charges (e.g., ERCOT 4CP) can add
      $60–90/kW-year. Plants lack tools to consistently avoid coincident peaks.
    - >-
      Manual, siloed scheduling: Kiln starts/soaks are planned around production
      and maintenance, not tariffs. Operators cannot easily simulate trade-offs
      between on-time delivery, soak profiles, and on-peak penalties, resulting
      in avoidable cost and peak spikes.
    - >-
      Inadequate forecasting: Plants often lack reliable day-ahead load
      forecasts (MAPE >15%), limiting their ability to pre-cool/pre-heat and
      shift auxiliary loads, or to participate in DR/curtailment with
      confidence.
    - >-
      Quality and safety constraints: Any schedule change must respect ramp
      rates, soak times, refractory material specs, and environmental compliance
      limits (e.g., NOx permitting). Fear of quality risks leads to missed
      savings opportunities.
    - >-
      Fragmented data and limited IT/OT resources: Tariffs, ISO/RTO signals,
      weather, and plant historians (OPC UA/Modbus/CSV) are not unified;
      engineering teams cannot sustain day-to-day optimization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Plant-level day-ahead and intraday load forecasting (hourly, 5–15 min
      granularity) with adaptive models tuned to kiln cycles, ambient
      conditions, and production plans.
    - >-
      Tariff co-optimization engine that schedules kiln starts/soaks and
      auxiliary loads against TOU, demand charges, and coincident peak
      predictors (e.g., ERCOT 4CP, PJM/NISO peaks).
    - >-
      Operator-ready day-ahead recommendations delivered by 13:00 local time,
      with auto-updates on price/peak alerts; includes what to start, delay, or
      curtail, by how much and for how long.
    - >-
      Quality- and safety-aware constraints library (ramp rates, soak durations,
      max temp differentials, emissions/permit limits) to ensure process
      integrity.
    - >-
      M&V module using IPMVP Option C to quantify savings and avoided demand
      charges, with finance-grade reporting and audit trail.
    - >-
      Integrations with SCADA/EMS (OPC UA, Modbus, Rockwell/Siemens historians),
      tariff APIs, weather, and DR platforms; optional closed-loop dispatch for
      non-critical loads.
    - >-
      Portfolio view to coordinate across multiple plants; scenario planning to
      test production changes, maintenance windows, or new tariffs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce total electricity spend 8–15% within 90 days by forecasting plant
    load, aligning kiln schedules with tariffs and grid peaks, and issuing
    day-ahead, constraint-aware shift/curtail recommendations—without
    compromising product quality.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A kiln-specific optimization library and dataset built from refractory and
    clay operations, enabling fast, safe deployment (2–6 weeks) and
    constraint-aware recommendations that general EMS tools cannot provide;
    pre-built 4CP/peak predictors and utility program pre-qualification
    streamline incentive capture and reduce customer risk via performance
    guarantees.
