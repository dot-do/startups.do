  problem:
    - >-
      Haul cycles are opaque; most quarries do not measure load, travel, dump,
      and queue segments with enough fidelity to act daily.
    - >-
      Queueing at loaders/crushers and at weighbridges frequently consumes
      10–25% of truck hours, but is rarely quantified or tied to dispatch/shift
      changes.
    - >-
      Rough/under-maintained haul segments lower average speed by 5–15%,
      increase fuel/ton, and accelerate tire/suspension wear; maintenance is
      reactive, not ROI-prioritized.
    - >-
      Existing OEM telematics are siloed by brand; mixed fleets lack a unified
      view across Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo, Deere, etc.
    - >-
      Manual studies (stopwatches, time–motion) are infrequent, sample only a
      few trucks, and miss shift-to-shift variability and weather impacts.
    - >-
      Plant throughput goals (tons/hour) are not directly connected to
      actionable roadwork, dispatch, and loader assignment changes.
    - >-
      Energy costs (diesel/electric) fluctuate; fuel burn per ton is not
      monitored per segment/grade, making efficiency programs hard to target.
    - >-
      Safety/EHS exposure increases on rough segments and in long queues;
      near-miss hotspots are not mapped against road conditions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion: Connect to existing truck GPS and payload signals via OEM
      APIs (ISO 15143-3/AEMP 2.0), Trimble Loadrite/scale files, or a low-cost
      gateway if needed.
    - >-
      AI cycle segmentation: Model detects load, travel loaded, dump, travel
      empty, waiting/queue states per truck with >92% F1 vs hand-labeled data;
      no manual geofencing required.
    - >-
      Queue analytics: Automatic identification of queue hotspots (loader,
      crusher, weighbridge) with minute-level trends by shift, weather, and
      blast day.
    - >-
      Haul-road condition mapping: Build a speed-normalized roughness index per
      10–25 m segment using speed drop vs grade/curvature and payload state;
      flag segments that cause >0.5 min added cycle time per pass.
    - >-
      Throughput and dispatch optimizer: What-if scenarios showing tons/hour
      impact of fixing top 5 segments, changing loader assignments, or
      staggering breaks.
    - >-
      Fuel/ton and cost impact: Attribute fuel burn and idle to cycle stages and
      road segments; quantify $/day savings and tire/suspension risk reduction.
    - >-
      Action workflows: Auto-generate roadwork work orders (e.g., “grade 280 m
      at Bench 3 S-curve”), queue mitigations (stagger truck release), and
      loader utilization targets.
    - >-
      Dashboards and alerts: Shift reports, live heatmaps, SMS/WhatsApp alerts
      when queue minutes exceed thresholds, and weekly ROI summaries for
      managers.
    - >-
      APIs/exports: Push KPIs to corporate BI (Power BI/Tableau), maintenance
      CMMS, and dispatch tools; export CSV/GeoJSON of hotspots.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase tons per shift by 3–10% and cut fuel/ton by 3–7% in 30 days—using
    your existing truck GPS and payload data. Vendor-agnostic haul-cycle, queue,
    and haul-road condition analytics that turn maps into prioritized actions
    and ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic models trained across mixed fleets and site conditions,
    requiring no new hardware at most sites; rapid one-day onboarding and a
    library of proven, quantified actions that tie directly to tons/hour and
    fuel/ton improvements. Accumulated cross-site benchmarks create defensible
    insights competitors cannot easily replicate.

  character: >-
    Quarry and mine ops leaders (superintendents, dispatchers, haul-road crews)
    who must hit tonnage targets with a fixed fleet, variable roads, and rising
    fuel/tyre costs.
  problem: >-
    External: Hidden queueing at loader/crusher/scale and rough haul segments
    slow trucks and waste fuel. Internal: Frustration with radio-based guesswork
    and siloed telematics. Philosophical: Every ton should move safely,
    predictably, and efficiently—decisions should be data-driven, not based on
    hunches.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know shift performance is won or lost on the haul. Authority: AI
    trained on millions of cycles in NAICS 212319; integrates with OEM
    GPS/payload; secure, audited, and backed by case studies delivering
    measurable improvements.
  plan: >-
    Simple 3-step path: 1) Connect GPS/payload feeds (days, not months). 2) View
    automatic haul cycle breakdowns, queue detection, and rough-road heatmaps
    tied to speed/fuel. 3) Act on alerts and weekly recommendations; verify ROI
    with before/after reports and API exports. Low-risk: pilot-ready, minimal/no
    hardware, you own your data.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 30-day pilot on one circuit.
    Transitional: Download a sample report and run the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Shorter cycles, higher tons/hour, lower fuel/ton and tyre wear, smoother
    safer roads, fewer idling hours and emissions, confident dispatching, and a
    repeatable continuous-improvement loop.
  failure: >-
    Status quo persists: chronic queues, wasted fuel, rough roads, unplanned
    maintenance, missed production targets, and avoidable safety risk.
