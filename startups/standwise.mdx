  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stand conflicts and late swaps increase tows and delays:
      medium-to-large airports see 2–8 last-minute tows/day costing $600–$2,500
      each and causing 5–20 min knock-on delays.
    - >-
      Manual allocation is cognitively intensive and brittle: allocators track
      50–200 constraints (aircraft size/bridge, Schengen/non-Schengen,
      adjacency, curfews, safety zones, PRM gates, code-share adjacency) across
      100–300 daily movements; errors rise during IROPs and peaking waves.
    - >-
      Existing RMS tools surface conflicts but give limited, slow or opaque
      optimization; allocators still spend 1–2 hours/shift firefighting and
      reconciling rules across AODB/RMS/stand plans.
    - >-
      Poor justifications erode stakeholder trust: airlines challenge gate
      changes without clear why/impact; lack of audit trails creates disputes
      and SLA penalties.
    - >-
      Static rules don’t adapt to real-time changes (METAR/NOTAM, late inbounds,
      equipment outages), leading to suboptimal use of contact stands and
      increased remote parking/busing costs.
    - >-
      Operational KPIs (D0/D15, passenger connection times, towing count) are
      not directly tied to allocation decisions in tools; hard to quantify ROI
      or coach teams.
    - >-
      Integration risk and long projects: airports fear multi-month RMS
      rip/replace; need a low-risk overlay that coexists with current AODB/RMS.
  solution:
    - >-
      Overlay copilot that plugs into existing AODB/RMS to continuously scan
      allocations, detect conflicts, and propose ranked, constraint-compliant
      assignments with full justifications.
    - >-
      Real-time constraint engine with airport-specific rules (aircraft/stand
      compatibility, pier/immigration segregation, wingtip clearance, tow paths,
      noise/curfew, preferential airline gates, maintenance blocks).
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer that balances KPIs: minimize tows/remote
      stands/passenger walking time, protect wave peaks and connections, respect
      airline preferences and fairness.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: allocator accepts/edits proposals; system
      learns from decisions to refine suggestions while maintaining safety
      constraints and auditability.
    - >-
      What-if simulation and IROPs playbooks: fast re-optimization for late
      inbounds, equipment outages, weather, runway closures; scenario scoring
      against KPIs.
    - >-
      Transparent explanations: every suggestion includes supporting rules,
      impacts (OTP, tows, walking distance), affected flights/airlines, and risk
      analysis for quick stakeholder buy-in.
    - >-
      Edge-ready deployment with fail-safe: on-prem or VPC; deterministic
      fallbacks and read-only mode if data sources degrade; full audit logs for
      compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An explainable, safety-first AI copilot that detects conflicts, proposes
    optimal stand swaps in under 2 seconds, and documents the why. Reduce
    last-minute tows by 25–40%, allocator firefighting time by 30–50%, and
    improve D0 by 1–3 percentage points within 90 days—without replacing your
    RMS/AODB.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Explainable, airport-specific constraint modeling language and optimization
    engine that learns allocator preferences while enforcing hard safety rules;
    deep, certified connectors across major AODB/RMS vendors enabling fast,
    low-risk overlay deployments; growing, proprietary dataset of allocation
    decisions/outcomes that improves recommendations and KPI impact per airport.

  problem: >-
    External: Stand conflicts, irregular ops, late changes, and complex
    constraints (aircraft fit, MARS, towing, customs, airline priorities)
    overwhelm legacy tools. Internal: Allocators feel rushed, second‑guessed,
    and blind to knock‑on effects. Philosophical: Safety‑ and service‑critical
    decisions shouldn’t rely on spreadsheets and memory.

    Empathy: We understand how last‑minute swaps cascade and create radio chaos.
    Authority: Built with airport ops SMEs; explainable AI and a robust
    constraint engine that respects local rules and integrates with AODB/stand
    systems.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect schedule, resources, and rules; 2) Get real‑time
    assignments, conflict alerts, and ranked alternatives with reasons; 3)
    Approve or override in one click; audit trail syncs back. Agreement: Your
    rules first, human‑in‑the‑loop always, secure pilot before go‑live.

    wave. Transitional: Download the Gate/Stand Readiness Checklist and request
    an ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Proactive conflict resolution, fewer late gate changes, faster turns, higher
    OTP, reduced towing and radio traffic, clear justifications for every
    assignment, happier airlines and passengers, confident allocators.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting: cascading swaps, avoidable delays and violations,
    costly tows, missed slots, blame cycles, and fatigued teams.
