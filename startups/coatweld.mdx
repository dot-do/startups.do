  problem:
    - >-
      High cost of rework and scrap from powder coat and weld defects (typical
      rework 3–7% of units; scrap 0.5–2%).
    - >-
      Manual visual inspection is inconsistent and labor-constrained; inspector
      agreement on subtle defects (orange peel, thin film) is often <70%.
    - >-
      Late detection (post-cure or post-assembly) multiplies cost by 3–10x
      versus detection at line-out.
    - >-
      Customer returns harm brand and dealer relationships; finish/weld defects
      drive 15–30% of quality complaints in metal office furniture.
    - >-
      No digital traceability of finish/weld quality by part/serial; weak
      feedback loops to upstream processes (pretreatment, oven, weld
      parameters).
    - >-
      Existing machine vision is rule-based, brittle to product mix and color
      changes; high maintenance by integrators; poor explainability.
    - >-
      Powder coat thin film and texture defects are hard to quantify inline;
      current gauges are spot checks, not 100% coverage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Camera-based inspection stations for powder coat line-out (pre- or
      post-cure, depending on defect mode) and for manual/robot weld cells.
    - >-
      Domain-trained AI models for powder coat defects (orange peel, fisheyes,
      thin film, runs/sags, contamination) and weld quality (porosity, undercut,
      underfill/overlap, spatter, bead geometry).
    - >-
      Explainable outputs: per-part pass/fail, defect class, severity scores,
      and heatmaps; weld dimensional measurements (leg length, throat, bead
      width) and continuity checks.
    - >-
      Edge inference appliance for sub-300 ms decision latency; optional sensor
      fusion with inline DFT thickness sensors and laser profile sensors for
      weld geometry.
    - >-
      Integration to PLCs, andon, MES/QMS (e.g., Plex, Epicor, Tulip, Ignition)
      for automated divert to rework, eKanban, and traceability.
    - >-
      Operator UI with guided rework instructions, live images, and defect
      libraries; continuous learning via human-in-the-loop labeling workflow.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboards: FPY, defect Pareto by SKU/shift/booth/welder,
      oven/powder parameter correlations, and ROI tracking.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered, explainable, retrofit vision QA that detects powder coat and
    weld defects in real time, delivering pass/fail plus heatmaps and
    dimensional checks, cutting rework/scrap by 30–50% and boosting first-pass
    yield without slowing the line.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific dataset and pre-trained models for office furniture powder
    coat and weld defects, plus validated mounting/lighting recipes and

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quality and Operations leaders at metal office-furniture manufacturers who
    must deliver consistent powder-coat and weld quality to hit first-pass yield
    and on-time delivery.
  problem: >-
    Manual inspection varies and misses defects—powder coat issues (orange peel,
    fisheyes, thin film) and weld problems slip through—driving rework, scrap,
    chargebacks, and late shipments. Quality shouldn’t depend on tired eyes and
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Vision QA is your AI inspection partner. Built by manufacturing and
    vision/NDT engineers, tuned for office furniture lines, and proven to
    deliver clear pass/fail decisions with heatmaps your team can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Line assessment and data capture. 2) Pilot: install cameras and edge AI;
    train on your parts. 3) Go-live: pass/fail gating, heatmaps,
    dashboards/alerts; optional PLC/MES tie-in. 4) Ongoing tuning and support.
    Simple monthly subscription; minimal disruption to current workflow.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute line walkthrough and start a 2-week pilot. Or get the QA
    readiness checklist and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Raise first-pass yield, cut rework/returns 30–60%, speed root-cause with
    heatmaps, gain traceable QA records for audits, protect brand, and ship on
    time with confidence.
  failure: >-
    If nothing changes, defects keep escaping, costs climb from scrap and
    rework, customers escalate chargebacks, lines slow for manual checks, and
    teams stay stuck firefighting quality issues.
