  problem:
    - >-
      Shops spend 15–45 minutes programming simple 2.5D wood parts from
      DXF/prints, causing bottlenecks when job mix is high and runs are short.
    - >-
      Inconsistent feeds/speeds and toolpath strategies across programmers
      create variable quality, tool wear, and scrap (1–5% scrap typical on
      new/complex runs).
    - >-
      Setup sheets are often tribal knowledge (spreadsheets/whiteboards),
      increasing changeover time and operator errors.
    - >-
      Post-processor differences (ShopBot, Biesse/Homag, Syntec, OSAI, Fanuc,
      Mach3/4, AXYZ, Avid, Laguna) lead to machine-specific rework and risk of
      unsafe moves.
    - >-
      Existing CAM tools (Vectric, Alphacam, EnRoute, Fusion 360, Mastercam
      Router) require manual layer mapping, tool selection, tabbing, and pocket
      profiling; macro automation exists but is brittle and time-consuming to
      maintain.
    - >-
      Recruiting/retaining experienced CAM programmers is difficult; one
      programmer typically supports 2–4 routers, capping throughput.
    - >-
      Cycle time estimation is often inaccurate (±25–40%), complicating
      scheduling and costing.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted toolpathing pipeline that ingests DXF/parametric forms,
      auto-recognizes features (profiles, pockets, slots, holes, counterbores),
      applies shop-approved strategies, and outputs verified G-code per machine.
    - >-
      Material- and tool-aware feeds/speeds suggestions with ramping, stepdowns,
      and chipload targets tuned for wood composites and hardwoods.
    - >-
      Automatic tab strategy, onion-skin passes, dogbone/teardrop fillets for
      joinery, lead-in/out smoothing, safe Z clearance, vacuum zone-aware moves.
    - >-
      Post-processed code for target controllers and a one-click printable/QR
      digital setup sheet (tools, offsets, hold-down, vacuum zones, estimated
      cycle time, yield).
    - >-
      Template library for part families: parameterize features and rules once,
      reuse across sizes/variants; AI learns from accepted/rejected toolpaths.
    - >-
      Lightweight simulation/verification and cycle-time estimation; optional
      integration with nesting tools to take per-part paths to sheet nests. 
    - >-
      APIs/connectors to common file sources (shared folders, Drive, Dropbox)
      and PDM/ERP job travelers; revision control and traceability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From DXF or parametric inputs to machine-ready G-code and printable/QR setup
    sheets in under 2 minutes—consistent, safe, and optimized toolpaths tailored
    to your router and material, with measurable reductions in programming time,
    scrap, and changeovers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning on wood-specific 2.5D parts across multiple shops plus
    a validated post library per controller—resulting in higher first-pass
    acceptance and safer, shop-approved defaults that generic CAM or macros
    cannot match.
