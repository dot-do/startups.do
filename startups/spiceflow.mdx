  risks:
    - Poor master data or promo history reduces accuracy

  problem:
    - >-
      Forecast error at SKU-customer level is high (typical WAPE 25–45%) due to
      seasonality, promotions, and long-tail SKUs, driving either stockouts or
      bloated safety stocks.
    - >-
      Long and volatile raw spice lead times (8–20 weeks) plus MOQs cause either
      shortages or excess capital tied in inventory.
    - >-
      Complex constraints (allergen/heat carryover, kosher/organic campaigns,
      solvent/extraction room capacity, sanitation windows) make manual weekly
      scheduling error-prone.
    - >-
      Frequent changeovers (1–4 hours) and suboptimal sequencing reduce OEE by
      5–15% versus feasible optimum.
    - >-
      Service levels below target (e.g., 92–95% case fill) cause chargebacks and
      lost revenue; OTIF penalties and expedite freight raise cost-to-serve.
    - >-
      Shelf-life and aroma potency decay require lot rotation; poor planning
      leads to write-offs/markdowns (1–3% of COGS).
    - >-
      Master data and planning happen in spreadsheets; planners spend 10–20
      hours/week wrangling data rather than scenario analysis.
    - >-
      S&OP lacks a quantitative link between demand uncertainty and
      capacity/ingredient purchasing plans, leading to reactive firefighting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from ERP/WMS/MES (e.g., SAP, Infor, NetSuite) to build a
      unified SKU-customer demand history and constraints library.
    - >-
      Probabilistic SKU-customer forecasts (12–18 months rolling) with promotion
      and seasonality features; quantify uncertainty (prediction intervals).
    - >-
      Finite-capacity weekly production scheduling by line/cell with
      allergen/heat carryover rules, solvent room capacity, sanitation and labor
      calendars.
    - >-
      Raw spice and packaging MRP with MOQs, supplier calendars, lead-time
      variability, country-of-origin substitutions, and yield factors
      (cleaning/grinding/extraction).
    - >-
      Scenario planning (e.g., supplier delay, promo uplift, new customer
      onboarding) with service/cost/COGS impact and recommended actions.
    - >-
      Automated safety stock and reorder point optimization using demand
      variability and lead-time distributions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration pushing planned orders and purchase requisitions
      back to ERP; planner overrides and workflow approvals.
    - >-
      S&OP cockpit: volume/value views, forecast value add, capacity outlook,
      cash tied in inventory, and service risk heatmaps.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: model monitoring, bias correction, seasonal drift
      detection, and rapid re-forecasting after large shocks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI forecasting and finite-capacity scheduling for spice and
    extract operations that turns noisy SKU-level demand into a
    capacity-feasible weekly production and raw spice purchasing plan in under
    30 minutes—improving fill rate by 2–5 points, cutting inventory 15–25%, and
    reducing changeover hours 20–30%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Spice/extract-specific planning templates (allergen/heat carryover,
    solvent/extraction room constraints, aroma shelf-life/decay) plus an
    anonymized benchmark library of yields, lead times, and changeovers
    collected across deployments—enabling faster time-to-value and higher
    accuracy than generalist planning tools. Early reference wins and prebuilt
    ERP connectors further lower switching costs and raise defensibility.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and supply chain leaders at spice and extract manufacturers
    (NAICS 311942) who need reliable weekly schedules, confident raw spice
    purchasing, and fewer fire drills.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile demand, promotions and seasonality, long supplier lead
    times, allergen/changeover constraints, and shared equipment. Internal:
    spreadsheet-driven planning, expediting, poor line utilization, and
    inventory imbalances. Philosophical: it shouldn’t be hard to know what to
    make and buy each week.
  guide: >-
    We understand 311942 realities—batching, allergen segregation, steam
    treatment, and volatile commodities. Our AI service forecasts SKU-level
    demand and generates a capacity-feasible weekly production schedule with an
    aligned raw spice purchasing plan—purpose-built by manufacturing planners
    and data scientists for your world.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your data (orders, BOMs, routings, capacities, supplier lead
    times). 2) Calibrate and validate (clean SKUs, segment demand, train
    forecast, set changeover and capacity constraints). 3) Go live (weekly
    finite schedule plus purchasing plan; review in a simple S&OP cadence).
    Start with a low-risk pilot, then scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or start a pilot to see your first SKU-level forecast and
    capacity-feasible weekly plan.
  success: >-
    A clear forward view of demand, a realistic weekly production schedule,
    synchronized raw spice buying, higher service levels, fewer expedites and
    changeovers, lower overtime and inventory, and confident S&OP communication.
  failure: >-
    Without this, firefighting continues—stockouts on key blends, stale
    inventory write-offs, rush freight and overtime, missed promotions,
    allergen-related rework, planner burnout, and eroding margins.
