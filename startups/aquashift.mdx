  problem:
    - >-
      High changeover frequency and long setup times on bottled water lines
      (30–120 minutes per changeover) drive 10–25% of total line time as
      non-productive.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-based scheduling cannot keep up with late orders, line
      downtime, and supply variability, leading to last-minute fire drills and
      rework on the floor.
    - >-
      Overtime is routinely used to hit ship dates, inflating labor costs by
      10–20% in peak weeks.
    - >-
      Complex SKU mix (sizes, labels, caps, pack configurations, flavored vs.
      unflavored, returnable pallets) makes optimal sequencing non-intuitive;
      planners often miss lower-cost sequences.
    - >-
      Service-level penalties and retailer appointment windows require precise
      adherence; frequent reschedules degrade OTIF performance by 2–5 percentage
      points.
    - >-
      Poor changeover planning increases scrap (labels/film) and sanitation
      water usage during flavor-to-plain switches.
    - >-
      Existing APS tools are generic, hard to integrate with floor realities,
      and don’t push clear, actionable run lists to operators.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingests orders, forecasts, and constraints from ERP/MES/WMS daily (and
      intra-day) to build an optimized line schedule.
    - >-
      Models a plant-specific changeover matrix (size, cap, label, film, flavor
      sanitation, pallet type) and minimizes total changeover time and count
      subject to ship dates and shift/labor limits.
    - >-
      Optimizes for OTIF by aligning runs to truck appointment windows and
      warehouse capacity while respecting maintenance and sanitation windows.
    - >-
      Pushes updated run lists and printed traveler labels to the floor at
      defined cutoffs (e.g., 05:00 and 13:00) with operator-friendly
      instructions.
    - >-
      Provides what-if simulation for planners to evaluate rush orders, downtime
      events, or material shortages before committing changes.
    - >-
      Captures actuals (run times, changeover durations, unplanned downtime) to
      continuously improve the schedule via learning and refine the setup
      matrix.
    - >-
      Includes guardrails: maximum reschedules per shift, lock windows around
      changeovers in progress, and approval workflows to prevent floor churn.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Daily AI-driven production re-sequencing for bottled water that minimizes
    changeovers and overtime while hitting ship dates, with floor-ready run
    lists that operators can execute without guesswork.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    matrices and floor-first execution UX, plus a growing anonymized dataset of
    bottled water changeover actuals that continuously improves estimates and
    outperforms generic APS tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and production schedulers at bottled water plants who must hit
    ship dates without burning hours on changeovers and overtime.
  problem: >-
    - External: High-SKU mix (sizes, pack counts, labels, cap colors) and late
    order changes trigger frequent changeovers and firefighting.

    - Internal: Teams are exhausted, plans change hourly, and floor supervisors
    lose trust in the schedule.

    - Philosophical: The schedule should serve the line and customers—not the
    other way around.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pain of ripping up tomorrow’s plan after a late
    customer email.

    - Authority: Manufacturing-grade AI and optimization tuned to your
    changeover matrix (size, label, film, cap, pallet pattern),
    sanitation/maintenance windows, and labor limits; integrates with ERP/MES;
    transparent and overrideable.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect orders, routings, and changeover matrix; 2) Calibrate
    objectives (min changeovers, min overtime, meet ship dates) and constraints;
    3) Pilot on one line; 4) Go live with daily re-sequencing; 5) Push updated
    run lists to the floor each morning and on change.

    - Agreement: Read-only ERP/MES integration, data security in your cloud/VPN,
    supervisor locks and manual overrides, full audit trail and rollback.
