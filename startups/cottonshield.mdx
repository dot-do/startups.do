leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High and variable pest pressure (bollworm, whitefly, aphids) and foliar
      diseases cause 5–15% yield losses in outbreak years; losses are highly
      localized and weather-driven.
    - >-
      Growers commonly apply 2–5 insecticide sprays per season; 1–2 sprays are
      often prophylactic due to uncertainty, costing $25–$45 per acre per spray
      (product + application + labor).
    - >-
      Scouting labor is constrained during peak windows; field coverage and
      timing gaps lead to late interventions and resistance risk.
    - >-
      Existing advisory tools are generic; they do not combine degree-days, trap
      counts, weather, and in-field images into field-specific, actionable
      thresholds.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (weather, traps, farm platforms) and lack of integrations
      make it hard to see risk, act, and audit decisions in one workflow.
    - >-
      Regulatory, sustainability, and buyer programs increasingly require
      documentation of integrated pest management (IPM) and reduction of
      unnecessary pesticide use.
    - >-
      Insurance and lenders lack timely, objective indicators of pest risk to
      support risk-adjusted decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest weather, degree-days, trap counts, and geotagged field photos to
      produce a daily 0–100 risk score per pest/disease for each field.
    - >-
      Convert risk into clear action thresholds using regional extension
      guidance; push recommendations (scout now, treat within X days, hold) with
      sampling plans.
    - >-
      Alerting engine provides 5–7 day lead time for emerging risk and 24–48
      hour heads-up for threshold crossings.
    - >-
      Mobile and web app with offline field mode for photo capture, quick
      counts, and treatment logging; SMS/WhatsApp alerts for low-friction
      adoption.
    - >-
      Integrations with JD Operations Center, Climate FieldView, and retailer
      portals; single sign-on and shapefile/field boundary sync.
    - >-
      Post-season ROI report quantifying sprays avoided, yield protected, and
      cost savings to support next-year planning and sustainability claims.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce sprays and protect yield with field-specific, 5–7 day pest/disease
    risk forecasts and action thresholds—delivered where you work (SMS, app, and
    farm platforms)—backed by university-validated models and your own
    trap/photo data.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously expanding, region-specific labeled dataset that fuses trap
    counts, degree-days, and in-field images—validated with university
    partners—enables earlier, more accurate alerts than generic models. Deep
    integrations into grower/consultant workflows (JD/FieldView) reduce
    switching costs and create data network effects.

    Cotton farm managers and crop advisors who want simple, field-level risk
    alerts and action thresholds to protect yield and reduce spray passes.
  problem: >-
    External: Unpredictable bollworm, whitefly, aphid, and foliar disease
    pressure tied to weather and crop stage. Internal: Anxiety about missing
    action thresholds and wasting time/money on poorly timed sprays.

    We understand tight spray windows, resistance pressure, and scouting gaps.
    Our AI fuses weather, degree-days, traps, and photos to score risk for
    bollworm, whitefly, aphids, and foliar diseases, flagging action
    thresholds—validated with IPM models and agronomist input.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect fields: draw boundaries, choose weather source, link traps,
    enable photo uploads. 2) Set crop/stage and action thresholds. 3) Receive
    daily risk scores and threshold alerts with recommended actions and scouting
    checklists. 4) Review outcomes; tune settings with our support. Data
    private; cancel anytime.
