leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime of presses, mixers, and conveyors causes 3–8%
      production loss in concrete block/brick plants, with downtime costs of
      $3,000–$12,000 per hour (lost throughput, scrap, overtime).
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely reactive/preventive time-based; wear on rams,
      molds, hydraulic pumps, bearings, and mixer gearboxes is not predicted
      from PLC data despite rich signals (amps, cycle counts, alarms).
    - >-
      OEM add-ons and general PdM tools lack domain-specific failure libraries
      for block plants, leading to high false positives and low adoption.
    - >-
      Fragmented data silos (PLC/SCADA, maintenance logs/CMMS, spare parts)
      prevent learning from past failures and measuring ROI.
    - >-
      IT/OT constraints and limited on-site data science make in-house AI
      initiatives difficult to start and sustain.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge agent ingests high-frequency PLC/SCADA signals (OPC UA, EtherNet/IP,
      Modbus/TCP), alarm/event logs, and maintenance history from CMMS.
    - >-
      Domain models detect anomalies and estimate remaining useful life (RUL)
      for components like press hydraulic pumps, mold/rams, mixer
      gearboxes/bearings, and conveyor drives/idlers.
    - >-
      Work-order recommendations auto-sent to CMMS with lead time targets
      (24–168 hours) and parts lists based on BOM/spares data.
    - >-
      Root-cause insights using failure-mode library (e.g., rising press cycle
      time variance, mixer motor current kurtosis, conveyor belt mis-tracking
      patterns).
    - >-
      Dashboards: OEE impact, predicted failures, model confidence, avoided
      downtime dollars, mean time between failures (MTBF) trends.
    - >-
      Security-first deployment: on-prem edge with outbound-only cloud sync;
      ISA/IEC 62443-aligned; role-based access; data minimization.
    - >-
      Implementation playbook: 90-day pilot with clear success criteria, then
      scale to multiple plants.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce unplanned downtime 15–25% within 6 months by turning existing PLC
    logs and maintenance history into accurate failure predictions and
    actionable work orders—no rip-and-replace, OEM-agnostic, with proven domain
    models for block/brick presses, mixers, and conveyors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing proprietary library of block/brick-specific failure signatures and
    RUL models mapped to PLC tags and CMMS actions, reducing time-to-value and
    false positives compared to generic PdM tools or OEM-only dashboards.
    Pre-built connectors/templates let us deploy in weeks, not quarters.

  character: >-
    Plant managers and maintenance leaders at concrete block and brick
    manufacturers (NAICS 327331) who need predictable uptime from presses,
    mixers, and conveyors to meet schedules, control costs, and keep crews safe.
  problem: >-
    External: Unplanned failures on presses, mixers, and conveyors cause lost
    shifts, scrap, missed OTIF, and overtime. Internal: You’re stuck
    firefighting without early warning or clear root causes. Philosophical:
    Critical assets shouldn’t fail in silence—your PLC and maintenance data
    should prevent breakdowns, not just record them.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand concrete plants run thin crews and high-load assets
    where a stopped press cascades across the yard. Authority: Our AI is
    purpose-built for 327331, learning from PLC logs and maintenance histories
    (cycle times, motor loads, stops, alarms) to flag early failure signatures
    with actionable lead time—often without adding new sensors.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: quick data and asset audit (presses, mixers, conveyors). 2)
    Connect: secure read-only link to PLC/historian and CMMS; define alert
    channels and work-order rules. 3) Predict & act: deploy models, receive
    risk-ranked alerts with likely failure mode and recommended task; review
    monthly to refine and scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute fit call or start a 30-day pilot on one line.
    Transitional: Download the plant readiness checklist and ROI worksheet.
  success: >-
    Fewer unplanned stops, stabilized throughput and batching, longer component
    life, safer planned maintenance windows, higher OEE, on-time delivery
    confidence, and a data-driven PM schedule that returns labor hours and
    spare-parts budget.
  failure: >-
    Remain in reactive mode: surprise breakdowns, weekend overtime, expedited
    freight, missed deliveries, safety exposure, and margin erosion as aging
    assets become harder to keep running.

    title: 'Predictive Maintenance for Presses, Mixers & Conveyors'
    subtitle: >-
      AI that predicts failures before they stop your block & brick line (NAICS
      327331). Uses PLC logs and maintenance history—no new sensors required.
    ctaText: Start your pilot
    ctaHref: /start-pilot
  problem:
    - 'Unplanned stops on presses, mixers, and conveyors slash daily output.'
    - Minor anomalies become major breakdowns between inspections.
    - PLC/SCADA and maintenance data stay siloed; issues are spotted too late.
    - 'Reactive maintenance drives overtime, rush parts, and missed deliveries.'
    - 'Wear shifts cycle times and pressures, increasing scrap and rework.'
    - Hard to know which asset will fail next—or how urgent it is.
    - Tight changeovers and curing windows leave little time to troubleshoot.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turn PLC logs and maintenance history into early‑warning alerts for
      bearings, gearboxes, hydraulics, motors, belts, and drives.
    - >-
      Detect abnormal torque, current, pressure, temperature proxies, and
      cycle‑time patterns—no new sensors required.
