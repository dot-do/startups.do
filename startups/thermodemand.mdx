leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Weather- and promo-driven demand volatility causes 10–25% weekly swings at
      SKU x customer/channel, leading to stockouts during heat waves and excess
      inventory during cool periods.
    - >-
      Most existing forecasting tools operate at brand/region level, not SKU x
      customer/channel weekly granularity required by production planners and
      account teams.
    - >-
      Promotions and retail price changes are not systematically quantified;
      uplift factors are guessed or applied uniformly, resulting in bias and
      poor replenishment.
    - >-
      Manual overrides and spreadsheet workflows create latency (1–2 week
      delays) and errors; no single source of truth feeding S&OP and production
      planning.
    - >-
      High changeover and expediting costs from misaligned production (rush
      runs, overtime, co-packer premium fees, suboptimal line sequencing).
    - >-
      Service-level penalties and lost sales due to low fill rates; retailers
      increasingly scorecard suppliers on on-time/in-full (OTIF), with
      chargebacks eroding margins.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data pipelines ingest orders/shipments, retailer POS (where
      available), promotions/TPR, holiday/events, and hyper-local weather; map
      locations to microclimates and channels.
    - >-
      Hierarchical forecasting (SKU → pack → brand → plant; customer → channel →
      region) with exogenous drivers (temperature, heat index, precipitation,
      holidays, promotions) and built-in bias control.
    - >-
      Near-term demand sensing (0–3 weeks) that updates daily with new weather
      forecasts and POS signals; heat-wave surge detector with incremental
      volume recommendations by SKU/channel.
    - >-
      Promo uplift modeling using price, display, feature, and historical
      elasticity by channel; scenario planning to test promo calendars and price
      points.
    - >-
      Production-aware outputs: constraint-ready weekly signals (baseline +
      incremental weather/promo lift) with suggested line sequencing and safety
      stock guidance.
    - >-
      Explainability: driver attribution (e.g., +8% due to temp anomaly),
      forecast value add vs. naïve/existing model, and segment-based targets
      (A/B/C, X/Y/Z).
    - >-
      One-click integration to S&OP/ERP/APS (SAP IBP/APO, Oracle, Blue Yonder,
      OMP, Anaplan) and data lakes; secure API and flat-file exports.
    - >-
      PoC-to-production playbook: 8–12 week pilot on 2–3 plants and top 200
      SKUs/channels; success criteria tied to WMAPE, fill rate, and expedite
      cost reduction.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Weather- and promo-aware weekly forecasts at SKU x customer/channel that
    improve accuracy 20–40% vs. current baseline, cut stockouts 15–30%, and
    reduce expedites/changeovers—live in 6–8 weeks and integrated with
    SAP/Oracle/Blue Yonder.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specific weather elasticity models and microclimate mapping tuned
    on bottled water demand patterns (e.g., differential response by pack size
    and channel), combined with promo-price-display feature engineering and
    hierarchical reconciliation. Prebuilt connectors to common beverage ERPs/APS
    and a governance framework that proves FVA vs. current systems, enabling
    guaranteed lift pilots and rapid time-to-value.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Demand planning and S&OP leaders at bottled water manufacturers who need
    reliable SKU x customer/channel forecasts.
  problem: >-
    External: weather- and promo-driven swings make weekly demand unpredictable.
    Internal: spreadsheets and lagging signals cause stockouts, excess
    inventory, overtime, and retailer penalties. Philosophical: you shouldn’t
    have to guess when data can tell you.
  guide: >-
    We understand the whiplash of heatwaves and promo spikes. Our beverage ops
    and data science team delivers an AI forecast that blends seasonality, local
    weather, holidays, and promotions into weekly SKU x channel predictions
    ready for S&OP and production planning.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect POS, shipments, promo calendars, and locations. 2) Run a 6-week
    pilot on priority SKUs/channels to validate accuracy and ROI. 3) Go live:
    automated weekly forecasts via API/files into S&OP and production systems
    with ongoing model tuning and support.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo or start a low-risk pilot.
  success: >-
    Right product, right place, right time; higher service levels with fewer
    expedites; lower inventory and waste; smoother production schedules;
    confident S&OP meetings and stronger retailer relationships.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing guesswork: heatwave stockouts, cool-week overstock, rush and penalty
    costs, eroded shelf space, and continued firefighting.
