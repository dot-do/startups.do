  problem:
    - >-
      Roof and rib falls remain a leading cause of fatalities, injuries, and
      unplanned downtime in underground coal mines.
    - >-
      Existing monitoring is siloed (microseismic, convergence, equipment
      telemetry) and mostly reactive; thresholds and alarms are not tuned to
      location- or shift-specific risk.
    - >-
      Control room operators and geotechnical engineers lack a fused, real-time
      view that translates signals into actionable, localized risk nowcasts.
    - >-
      False alarms erode trust, while missed precursors result in expensive
      production stoppages and safety incidents.
    - >-
      Integrating disparate OEM systems (Wi-Fi/mesh, seismic, bolting torque
      logs, miner shearer data) is complex and time-consuming; on-site analytic
      talent is limited.
    - >-
      Management needs measurable, defensible risk reduction and ROI, tied to
      fewer roof/rib incidents and fewer hours of downtime.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion platform that ingests microseismic, convergence
      (extensometers/props), and equipment telemetry (bolter torque/penetration
      rate, miner cutting energy, vibrations, shuttle car delays, machine
      chatter) plus location tracking.
    - >-
      Real-time nowcasting model trained on multi-mine datasets with
      site-specific calibration; outputs a risk score and traffic-light status
      per heading, intersection, face, and panel, by shift.
    - >-
      Operator UX: control room heatmap; shift-level alert feed with rationale
      (top contributing features) and recommended actions (e.g., slow advance,
      add supplemental support, change cut sequence, evacuate zone).
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: captures outcomes (support added, face idle time,
      observed falls) to retrain and reduce false positives.
    - >-
      Integrations with common mine networks (Rajant/Becker/PBE), OEM data buses
      (Joy/Komatsu/Eickhoff), historian systems (PI/AVEVA), and seismic vendors.
    - >-
      Optional retrofit kit for data-poor sites (edge gateway, low-power
      geophones, extensometers, BLE tags) with MSHA-certified components via
      partners.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Shift- and location-specific roof/rib fall risk nowcasts that fuse
    microseismic, convergence, and equipment signals into a single, trusted
    score—delivering early warning (30–120 minutes lead time), fewer false
    alarms, and actionable recommendations that cut incidents and downtime
    without adding sensors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-mine, multi-modal labeled dataset for underground coal roof/rib
    events; transfer learning models calibrated to local geology/support
    regimes; OEM/comms partnerships enabling low-friction integration; validated
