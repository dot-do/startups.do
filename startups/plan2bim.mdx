  problem:
    - >-
      Manual 2D-to-Revit modeling is slow (16–60 hours per 10k sq ft/930 m2),
      delaying visualization, coordination, and early takeoffs.
    - >-
      Quality is inconsistent across teams and vendors; missing
      walls/levels/doors lead to coordination clashes and rework.
    - >-
      Preconstruction needs fast, lightweight BIM for conceptual quantities and
      4D/5D studies, but often only receives 2D PDFs/DWGs.
    - >-
      Outsourcing is variable in cost and turnaround; in-house teams are
      capacity-constrained and expensive for repetitive drafting.
    - >-
      Fragmented workflows (PDF/CAD -> Revit/IFC) cause double entry and lost
      metadata.
    - >-
      Early-stage LOD 200 requirements are widespread, but many firms lack
      standardized QA for accept/reject criteria.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven parsing of PDFs/DWGs (vector and raster) to detect levels,
      grids, walls, doors, windows, columns, stairs, rooms, and basic
      MEP/structural placeholders.
    - >-
      Automated parameter mapping to Revit families and IFC classes, with
      normalization to naming standards (e.g., OmniClass/Uniclass).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option to reach acceptance thresholds and verify LOD
      200 compliance; flagged exceptions summarized for the client.
    - >-
      Deliverables: Revit (.rvt) LOD 200, IFC4 (Reference View) export, quantity
      schedule sheets, and QA report (accuracy scores, exceptions).
    - >-
      Revit plugin for 1-click upload of 2D sheets and 1-click import of
      generated models; API for batch/enterprise workflows.
    - >-
      Secure cloud pipeline with versioning, change-tracking, and audit trail
      for submittals and coordination reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From 2D plans/elevations to a clean LOD 200 Revit/IFC model in 24–72 hours
    at $0.06–$0.12 per sq ft ($0.65–$1.30/m2), with 95%+ geometric accuracy,
    early quantities, and built-in QA—no re-drafting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset of 2D-to-LOD200 pairs with standardized QA
    labels and parameter mappings, combined with a Revit-native plugin and
    enterprise-grade QA/IFC conformance. This data+workflow moat improves
    accuracy and turnaround times with every project and is difficult for new
    entrants to replicate.

      quantities and model-based coordination from 2D bid sets.
    - >-
      BIM/VDC consultants and offshore drafting firms seeking throughput gains
      and consistent quality with human-in-the-loop QA.

    Architects, engineers, contractors, and drafting teams who need a fast,
    dependable way to turn 2D plans/elevations into a lightweight LOD 200
    Revit/IFC model for visualization, coordination, and early takeoffs.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual 2D-to-3D conversion is slow, costly, and error-prone;
    inconsistent standards and formats stall coordination.

    - Internal: Teams are stuck waiting on models, worried about missed clashes
    and unreliable quantities.

    - Philosophical: Early-stage work shouldn’t require days of modeling just to
    see, align, and estimate.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand brutal deadlines, incomplete markups, and the
    pressure to coordinate early.

    Authority: Led by experienced BIM managers; proven on real projects; exports
    clean Revit/IFC; human QA on every delivery; secure file handling and clear
    naming/level standards.
  plan: |-
    Process:
