leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Fragmented planning: RF, transport, and finance teams use separate tools
      and spreadsheets; cross-functional CAPEX plans take 8–16 weeks to converge
      and are outdated upon approval.
    - >-
      Misallocated spend: Without a unified demand–supply gap and ROI view,
      5–15% of annual capacity CAPEX is routinely deployed in low-yield
      locations while high-need hotspots remain underfunded.
    - >-
      Forecast uncertainty: Traffic growth is volatile by cluster/sector
      (events, device mix, FWA, roaming); 3–12 month demand forecasts often
      exceed 15–25% MAPE at the sector level.
    - >-
      Slow hotspot detection: Congestion is identified reactively from lagging
      KPIs; median time-to-detect persistent hotspots exceeds 30 days.
    - >-
      Opaque ROI: Business cases rarely incorporate churn/retention uplift,
      spectrum constraints, permitting delays, or vendor lead times; realized
      ROI diverges from plan and is not closed-loop measured.
    - >-
      Budget constraints: CFOs need defensible, auditable prioritization and
      scenario trade-offs (e.g., $50M vs $75M) with clear NPV/IRR, but the
      network view is not in a finance-ready format.
    - >-
      Execution friction: Hand-off from planning to implementation lacks
      geospatial specificity and cost realism (zoning risk, pole access,
      backhaul upgrades), causing 10–20% plan slippage.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data unification: Ingest OSS/KPI counters, CM/topology, device mix,
      spectrum, backhaul, trouble tickets, and cost books; enrich with
      crowdsourced performance data and demographics/mobility signals.
    - >-
      Demand–supply gap model: Forecast per-sector demand (Gb/day and busy-hour)
      using seasonality, mobility, device mix, and event calendars; estimate
      supply with RF/radio configs, spectrum, interference, and backhaul
      constraints.
    - >-
      Intervention catalog and cost curves: Standardized actions (e.g., 3rd
      carrier add, 4x4 MIMO, macro split, small cell on pole, mmWave hotspot)
      with localized unit costs, lead times, and permitting risk by geography.
    - >-
      ROI engine: For each hotspot and intervention, compute impact on
      throughput, user experience, churn avoidance, and revenue/traffic growth;
      output NPV/IRR/payback and confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Optimizer: Given budget, constraints, and SLAs, produce an ordered,
      auditable list of investments with timing; support multi-scenario what-ifs
      (e.g., FWA growth +10%, spectrum refarm schedule).
    - >-
      Geospatial console and APIs: Map-based UI for planners and CFO view; APIs
      to push ranked work orders to ticketing/implementation systems
      (ServiceNow, OEM change management).
    - >-
      Closed loop: Post-implementation measurement vs. plan (KPI uplift,
      congestion cleared days, revenue proxy), retraining models to reduce
      forecast error and ROI variance.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SOC 2 Type II, least-privilege access, PII/CPNI
      avoidance, on-prem or VPC deployment options.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, geospatial CAPEX prioritization that ranks macro, small cell,
    and carrier add investments by demand–supply gap and expected ROI, then
    allocates budget optimally under real-world constraints—cutting planning
    cycle time by 50%+ and lifting realized ROI by 8–15% through closed-loop
    measurement.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A finance-grade, closed-loop ROI system purpose-built for wireless capacity
    planning that unifies RF, transport, and finance data; proprietary
    intervention cost/impact curves calibrated by geography; prebuilt connectors
    to major OEMs; and a track record of measured, audited ROI improvements from
    pilots—reducing perceived risk for carrier CFOs.

  character: >-
    Wireless carrier network planning, RF, and finance leaders (NAICS 517112)
    who want every CAPEX dollar to relieve congestion, lift QoE, and grow
    profitable traffic.
  problem: >-
    External: Exploding data demand, finite spectrum, tight budgets, and
    thousands of cells make hotspot decisions slow and risky. Internal:
    Uncertainty about which sites/sectors/small cells/carriers to upgrade first
    and fear of wasting budget or missing KPIs. Philosophical: Capital should
    follow customer impact and return—not guesswork or politics.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the pressure to justify every dollar and deliver
    faster relief. Authority: Built by ex‑telco network analytics leaders;
    field‑tested across markets; explainable demand–supply gap and ROI scoring;
    secure (NDA/SOC 2) and integrable.
  plan: >-
    1) Ingest & unify: traffic/KPIs, topology, spectrum, backhaul, costs,
    constraints. 2) Model & score: forecast demand–supply gaps, simulate
    remedies (component carriers, sectors, sites, small cells), rank by ROI/NPV
    and time‑to‑relief. 3) Deliver & iterate: ranked roadmap, action playbooks,
    what‑ifs; monthly/quarterly refresh; API/BI integration. Pilot: 6–8 weeks in
    1–2 markets with agreed success criteria and data‑use terms.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute discovery and launch a pilot this quarter.
    Transitional: Request a sample hotspot report, ROI calculator, and a
    reference case study.
  success: >-
    10–20% more effective CAPEX allocation with clear NPV; faster approvals;
    30–60 days quicker relief at top hotspots; higher throughput/QoE and fewer
    SLA breaches; reduced churn and ARPU lift in upgraded zones; alignment
    across RF, finance, and ops on one ranked plan.
  failure: >-
    Spread CAPEX thin and overbuild low‑impact sites; persistent congestion and
    complaints; delayed 5G/NR rollouts; firefighting OPEX spikes; lost share in
    high‑value areas; tough budget reviews with weak justification.
