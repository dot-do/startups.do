leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Highly variable supplier lead times (often 30–180+ days) cause missed
      customer SLAs and reactive expediting; in segment benchmarks, 15–25% of
      POs arrive 7+ days late.
    - >-
      Wholesalers rely on static lead-time settings in ERP (P21/Infor/SAP
      B1/NetSuite), updated infrequently; these underestimate real-world
      variability by 20–50%.
    - >-
      Expedite spend typically equals 2–6% of COGS on at-risk SKUs; most
      expediting is authorized without quantified ROI.
    - >-
      Shortage visibility is lagging; buyers discover risk after ship-dates slip
      or when fill-rate drops below 90–95%.
    - >-
      Re-sourcing decisions are manual and slow; buyers lack a consolidated
      vendor performance view across similar SKUs and suppliers.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, EDI 855/856, supplier emails, carrier tracking)
      breaks early-warning; teams depend on spreadsheets and email, driving high
      exception workload.
    - >-
      Limited forecasting of port congestion, holidays, strikes, or geopolitical
      events specific to supplier lanes impacts arrivals but is not modeled.
    - >-
      Executive teams lack a single metric for “dollars-at-risk” and
      mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) shortages to prioritize interventions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration in 2–6 weeks: ingest ERP PO/receipts, EDI 850/855/856,
      supplier confirmations, carrier visibility, calendars/holidays, and
      external disruption signals.
    - >-
      PO-level lead-time prediction: model supplier×SKU×lane variability,
      producing probabilistic arrival windows and confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Shortage early-warning: continuous risk scoring that flags POs likely to
      arrive after need-by date or cause inventory below safety stock.
    - >-
      Prescriptive actions: simulate expedite modes (air/LTL) and re-source
      options with cost/benefit, service impact, and payback; one-click
      recommendations routed to buyers.
    - >-
      Supplier benchmarking: performance scorecards (commit adherence, quality
      rejects, cycle time volatility) with peer benchmarks for this vertical.
    - >-
      Exception workflow: prioritize by “dollars-at-risk,” auto-email suppliers
      for commits, and log decisions to build closed-loop learning.
    - >-
      Planning feedback: auto-adjust ERP lead-time parameters and safety stock
      recommendations based on observed variance and service targets.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut shortage surprises and expedite spend with AI that predicts true
    supplier lead times, scores PO risk in real time, and recommends the
    highest-ROI expedite or re-source action—purpose-built for transportation
    equipment and supplies wholesalers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertical-specific, cross-tenant dataset of supplier performance in
    transportation equipment and supplies, enabling benchmarked lead-time models
    and prescriptive actions that generalist planning tools lack; reinforced by
    ERP/EDI partner integrations and closed-loop learning from expedite outcomes
    in this niche.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

  character: >-
    Supply chain and purchasing leaders at Transportation Equipment and Supplies
    (except Motor Vehicle) merchant wholesalers who must keep critical parts
    available and orders on time with lean inventory.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile supplier lead times, logistics disruptions, and upstream
    component shortages put POs at risk. Internal: limited early warning forces
    firefighting, expediting costs, and missed OTIF. Philosophical: you should
    know days or weeks ahead—not at dock date—so you can protect customers and
    margins.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of long-tail parts and service-critical SKUs. Our AI
    monitors every PO, learns supplier behavior for NAICS 42386, and turns
    ERP/ASN/logistics signals into clear delay probabilities and
    actions—securely and with fast onboarding.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect read-only ERP/PO data and select suppliers/SKUs. 2) Receive daily
    risk scores, lead-time forecasts, and shortage early warnings. 3) Act with
    auto-prioritized expedite, pull-in, or re-source recommendations and simple
    what-if ROI; start with a 30-day pilot, then scale.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute risk assessment demo. Transitional: Request a free
    lead-time volatility and shortage exposure report for your top SKUs.
  success: >-
    Fewer shortages and surprises, higher OTIF and service levels, fewer
    expedites, more accurate lead-time settings, lower working capital, stronger
    supplier performance, calmer teams, and confident customer commitments.
  failure: >-
    Without early warning: surprise stockouts, blown OTIF, rush freight and
    premium buys, idle crews, missed revenue, and churned customers.
