leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High setup/changeover time from grade/color/width/thickness/die changes
      reduces available run time by 15–35% weekly in many laminated plastics
      plate/sheet/shape plants.
    - >-
      Manual Excel- and whiteboard-based scheduling cannot account for
      sequence-dependent setups, annealing dwell times, adhesive cure windows,
      and cold/warm start penalties, leading to infeasible or suboptimal plans.
    - >-
      Frequent rush orders and resin/adhesive availability shifts cause
      rescheduling churn; planners spend 8–20 hours/week firefighting.
    - >-
      On-time delivery performance often sits at 75–90%, creating expediting
      costs, premium freight, and customer penalties.
    - >-
      Energy time-of-use tariffs and demand charges are not reflected in
      schedules, wasting 3–10% of energy spend on high-tariff hours.
    - >-
      ERP/MES built-in schedulers lack domain-specific constraints (e.g.,
      contamination rules, minimum run lengths, lamination stack-ups), causing
      plan-to-actual drift >20%.
    - >-
      Costly changeover cascades (e.g., color → adhesive → die) are not
      optimized across the full horizon, increasing scrap and cleaning chemical
      usage.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered optimizer (MILP + heuristic search) with sequence-dependent
      setup matrices for resin grade, color, width, thickness, die/tooling,
      adhesive, and oven states.
    - >-
      Rolling-horizon daily/weekly schedules that respect annealing dwell times,
      adhesive cure windows, minimum run lengths, WIP buffers, shift calendars,
      and maintenance outages.
    - >-
      Energy-aware planning that aligns heat-intensive steps with off-peak
      tariffs and caps demand to avoid peak charges.
    - >-
      What-if simulation for rush orders, machine downtime, and resin
      substitutions; compare KPIs vs. baseline before committing.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: publish to ERP/MES, receive actuals, auto-learn
      setup durations and contamination risks to refine future plans.
    - >-
      Fast deployment via templates for laminated plastics processes; prebuilt
      connectors to leading ERPs and common historians (OPC UA).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    ChangeoverWise APS is a domain-tuned scheduling AI that minimizes
    changeovers and lateness while shifting energy-intensive runs to low-tariff
    windows—producing feasible, plant-ready schedules in minutes and delivering
    10–25% more productive line time with 3–8% energy cost reduction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specialized scheduling engine with prebuilt changeover matrices and

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production managers, schedulers, and plant ops leaders at laminated plastics
    plate/sheet/shape manufacturers who want dependable daily/weekly extrusion,
    lamination, and annealing schedules that hit due dates and maximize OEE with
    fewer changeovers.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Constant changeovers from resin/color/thickness/tool swaps and
    oven/anneal window conflicts drain uptime.

    - External: Tight due dates, volatile mix, limited dies/lines/crews, energy
    time-of-use tariffs, and strict process constraints.

    - Internal: Schedulers firefight, teams work overtime, and promises feel
    risky.

    - Philosophical: Making high‑quality plastics shouldn’t require guesswork,
    waste, or sleepless nights.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know the pain of juggling resin families, color sequences,
    thickness ladders, and anneal/laminate windows under tariff clocks.

    - Authority: Built by manufacturing scheduling experts using constraint
    optimization and AI; integrates with ERP/MES; transparent, auditable logic
    tuned for your lines and changeover rules.
  plan: >-
    - Process: 1) Connect ERP/MES/orders and assets. 2) Configure constraints
    (materials, dies, anneal windows, crews, tariffs). 3) Simulate and validate
    against past weeks. 4) Go live with daily/weekly optimized schedules and
    operator-ready changeover lists.

    - Agreement: Clear success criteria, keep human override, data stays yours,
    start on one line then scale.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30‑minute fit call or start a 2‑week pilot on one line.

    - Transitional: Download a sample optimized schedule, ROI template, and
    constraint checklist.
  success: >-
    Materially fewer changeovers, higher on‑time delivery, lower energy cost via
    tariff‑aware sequencing, stabilized crew plans, improved throughput, clearer
    promise dates, calmer shifts, and confident customer commitments.
  failure: >-
    More late orders, wasted uptime on avoidable changeovers, premium energy
    charges, constant rescheduling, overtime and scrap, stressed teams, and lost
    revenue/opportunities.
