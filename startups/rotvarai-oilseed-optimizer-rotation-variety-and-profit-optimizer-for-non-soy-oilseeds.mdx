leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Profit variability in non‑soy oilseeds (canola, sunflower, safflower,
      flax/linseed, mustard, sesame, camelina) driven by suboptimal rotations,
      variety mismatch, and volatile basis/prices
    - >-
      Complex, time‑consuming variety/hybrid selection across brands, herbicide
      traits (LL, RR, Clearfield), maturity groups, and disease resistance
      packages with inconsistent local performance data
    - >-
      Rotation gaps amplify disease/insect pressure (e.g., sclerotinia,
      blackleg, clubroot, verticillium stripe; Phoma; head moth) and herbicide
      resistance, yet most tools don’t quantify multi‑year risk or enforce
      disease break intervals
    - >-
      Gross margins are sensitive to local input prices, basis, and yield risk;
      most growers rely on spreadsheets or generic FMS tools that don’t simulate
      scenarios or optimize against constraints
    - >-
      Advisors (independent agronomists, retailers) struggle to scale
      consistent, data‑backed recommendations across dozens of farms/fields
    - >-
      Existing point tools (disease calculators, seed finders) are siloed; no
      integrated, oilseed‑specific optimizer for 3–5 year rotation, variety
      choice, and pricing strategy
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi‑year rotation optimizer that enforces agronomic constraints (disease
      break intervals, herbicide MOA rotation, residue and soil moisture), while
      maximizing expected gross margin and minimizing yield risk
    - >-
      Brand‑agnostic variety/hybrid recommender matching micro‑climate, soil
      zone, maturity, lodging risk, oil profile, and resistance groups (e.g.,
      blackleg A–G) across canola, sunflower, safflower, flax, mustard, sesame,
      camelina
    - >-
      Stochastic gross margin simulator using local yield distributions,
      futures+basis, input costs, and operation constraints to output P50/P80
      outcomes and downside risk
    - >-
      Disease and pest risk models (sclerotinia, blackleg, clubroot,
      verticillium stripe, aster yellows proxies, insects) with in‑season alerts
      and action thresholds
    - >-
      Seeding rate and planting date optimizer by field (thermal time, soil
      moisture, frost risk windows); optional variable‑rate prescriptions
    - >-
      Integrations for data ingest/export: John Deere Operations Center, Climate
      FieldView, AgLeader; soil labs; SSURGO/CanSIS; weather APIs; elevator
      price/basis feeds
    - >-
      What‑if scenarios: input price changes, market premiums (e.g., high
      oleic), rotational alternatives (e.g., add camelina) with carbon/soil
      health modifiers
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Field‑level, 3–5 year rotation and variety optimizer purpose‑built for
    non‑soy oilseeds that increases gross margin by $10–35/acre and lowers
    disease loss risk 20–40% by matching hybrids/varieties, planting windows,
    and input plans to soils, weather, pest pressure, and local price/basis.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Oilseed‑specific optimization IP trained on multi‑year, field‑level outcomes
    with resistance group and disease incidence data, plus exclusive regional
    price/basis and variety trial partnerships; brand‑agnostic recommendations
    that integrate across seed companies and enforce agronomic constraints most
    general FMS tools ignore.

  character: >-
    Non‑soy oilseed growers and farm managers who want resilient rotations and
    predictable gross margins across canola, sunflower, safflower, flax/linseed,
    mustard, sesame, and camelina.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: price volatility, pests/diseases, and fragmented trial data.

    - External: complex rotation and variety tradeoffs across soils, disease
    carryover, herbicide systems, and local basis prices.

    - Internal: overwhelmed by guesswork and spreadsheet chaos.

    - Philosophical: farmers deserve decision tools as advanced as their
    equipment.
  guide: >-
    Rotation, Variety, and Profit Optimizer is your AI agronomy co‑pilot. We
    listen first and speak farm. Built with agronomists and data scientists, it
    combines your field history, soils, pest pressure, and local prices with
    university and strip‑trial data to recommend what works here—with clarity
    you can act on.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect your fields, constraints, and prices (boundaries, soil
    maps, past crops, herbicide history, seed options, target prices).

    - Step 2: Review an optimized rotation and variety lineup with gross‑margin
    scenarios, risk flags (e.g., blackleg, sclerotinia, broomrape/others by
    crop), and input budgets.

    - Step 3: Lock the plan, monitor signals, and adapt in‑season as markets and
    pest risks shift.

    - Agreement: start with one block/one season; clear ROI review; your data
    stays yours—no lock‑in.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: book a 20‑minute demo or start a 1‑block pilot. Transitional:
    download the Non‑Soy Oilseed Rotation Playbook and sample reports.
  success: >-
    Confident rotation decisions, stronger gross margins, precise variety
    placement by soil and disease risk, fewer carryover problems, cleaner
    fields, aligned marketing windows, and a repeatable planning workflow every
    season.
  failure: >-
    Without a smarter plan: rotation conflicts, yield drag, pest/disease
    flare‑ups, wasted seed and inputs, missed price windows, and another
    stressful planning cycle.

  problem:
    - Rotations across diverse oilseeds are hard to optimize by field.
    - Local variety performance shifts yearly; trial data is scattered.
    - Disease and insect carryover punish yields when timing is off.
    - Herbicide carryover and weed resistance constrain choices.
    - Price and basis move fast; gross margins change weekly.
    - 'Water, heat units, and input budgets vary by zone.'
    - 'Contract specs (high‑oleic, confection, linseed quality) add risk.'
    - Most tools are built for soy/corn—oilseed nuances get ignored.
  solution:
    - 'Field‑level AI blends soils, weather, pest history, and markets.'
    - Recommends crop‑by‑field rotations that break disease cycles.
    - 'Picks varieties by maturity, oil profile, lodging, and disease ratings.'
    - Live gross‑margin forecasts with price/yield sensitivity.
    - Carryover‑safe herbicide and seed programs aligned to rotation.
    - Scenario planning for drought/normal/wet and price bands.

    - 'Risk Scoring: disease, insect, shatter, lodging, marketing'
    - 'Field History Import: as‑applied, yield, and NDVI layers'
    - 'Exports: planting calendars, VRA prescriptions, CSV/Shape'
  steps:
    - 'Connect fields, soils, past crops, prices, and costs.'
    - 'Set goals: profit, risk, rotation rules, and contract targets.'
    - Review AI rotation and variety picks with margin breakdowns.
    - 'Lock plan and export seeding rates, chem plans, and calendars.'
