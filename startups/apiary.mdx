  problem:
    - >-
      High scouting costs and time: Commercial beekeepers and pollination
      providers spend 10–40 hours per potential yard scouting forage, water,
      access, and permissions; many sites are rejected after field visits.
    - >-
      Inconsistent forage and bloom timing: Year-to-year variation in bloom
      dates and forage density causes yield volatility and reduced colony
      strength.
    - >-
      Pesticide drift exposure: Spray events and drift from nearby fields can
      cause acute losses and sublethal effects; data is fragmented and real-time
      risk is hard to assess.
    - >-
      Access constraints: Private land permissions, road quality, slope, flood
      risk, and regulatory setbacks create last-mile failures after travel.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: Forage maps, pesticide records, weather, land ownership,
      water sources, and regulations reside in separate systems, requiring GIS
      expertise many operations lack.
    - >-
      Limited defensibility: Beekeepers must justify yard placement to growers,
      insurers, and regulators without standardized, objective scoring.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI siting engine that ingests satellite/remote-sensing forage indices,
      bloom forecasts, land use, weather/wind, terrain, land parcels, road
      quality, water sources, pesticide-use and drift proxies to produce a
      composite suitability score per candidate site.
    - >-
      Configurable weighting and constraints aligned to the operation’s
      priorities (e.g., spring buildup vs. honey flow).
    - >-
      Batch ranking of 50–500 candidate coordinates with automated elimination
      of sites failing regulatory setbacks or access thresholds.
    - >-
      Mobile field app (offline-enabled) for on-site validation, photos, notes,
      and one-tap permission workflows with landowners.
    - >-
      Alerts and short-term forecasts for spray risk and extreme weather, with
      route and move-planning for migratory cycles.
    - 'Exportable PDF/KML/GeoJSON reports for growers, insurers, and regulators.'
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Rank and de-risk apiary sites in minutes using a defensible, data-driven
    score that integrates forage, water, pesticide drift risk, access
    constraints, and regulations—cut field scouting time by 50–70%, reduce drift
    incidents by 30%, and improve honey yield 5–15% per colony.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from commercial pilots linking site scores to real
    outcomes (yield, loss, incident reports), plus calibrated phenology and
    drift models co-developed with extension partners—creating a proprietary
    dataset and model ensemble that is hard to replicate and improves each
    season.

  character: >-
    Commercial beekeepers and pollination managers who need to place hives in
    the best locations, fast.
  problem: >-
    External: Site selection is guesswork across forage, water, pesticide drift,
    and access; Internal: uncertainty risks colonies, contracts, and time;
    Philosophical: hive placement should be data-driven so every colony gets a
    fair chance to thrive.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of a bad site. Our team combines apiculture expertise
    with GIS/ML, fusing satellite vegetation indices, hydrology, drift models,
    land use, weather, and road data to score locations with transparent,
    validated methods.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload candidate sites and set weights for forage, water, drift, and
    access; 2) Get ranked scores, risk maps, and rationale; 3) Select sites and
    export routes, permits checklist, and reports. Agreement: transparent
    scoring, data privacy, support, and easy cancellation.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 14-day trial or book a 20-minute demo to upload your first sites
    today.
  success: >-
    Confidently place hives where they thrive: higher survival and yield, safer
    forage and water, fewer drift incidents, efficient routes, documented due
    diligence, and stronger grower relationships.
  failure: >-
    Keep relying on guesswork, risking poor forage, drift exposure, wasted fuel
    and labor, colony losses, and strained client trust.

  problem:
    - 'Choosing apiary sites is guesswork, risking poor yields and colony stress.'
    - >-
      Forage availability shifts by season and crop cycles—hard to quantify at
      scale.
    - Pesticide drift from nearby fields is invisible until losses occur.
    - Inadequate water access reduces brood health and productivity.
    - 'Access constraints inflate travel time, fuel, and labor costs.'
    - Manual research across maps and datasets is slow and error-prone.

      scores.
    - 'AI fuses satellite, land-use, crop, and weather data to score each factor.'
    - Seasonality-aware forage forecasts align placements with bloom windows.
    - >-
      Pesticide drift modeling flags risky neighbors using crop maps and wind
      patterns.
