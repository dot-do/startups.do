leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Retailer deductions/chargebacks average 1.5–3.0% of gross invoice value in
      footwear wholesale; 30–50% of these are invalid or disputable, but
      recovery is inconsistent and labor‑intensive.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (EDI 810/812/820, 856 ASNs, retailer portals, TMS/WMS,
      ERP) slows dispute prep; analysts spend 30–60% of time gathering proofs
      (POD/BOL/RTV/COMPLIANCE docs).
    - >-
      Retailer-specific rules and windows (30–180 days) cause missed deadlines
      and low recovery rates; playbooks are tribal knowledge and not
      standardized.
    - >-
      Lack of root-cause visibility by violation type (shortage vs. labeling vs.
      routing vs. EDI/ASN timing) prevents prevention, causing repeat
      deductions.
    - >-
      Manual portal submissions and email-based workflows cause long cycle times
      (10–20 days to file) and error-prone documentation.
    - >-
      Finance leadership lacks clear KPIs (gross deduction rate, win-rate by
      retailer, recovery cycle time) to manage working capital impact and
      prioritize fixes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion: Connect to ERP (NetSuite/SAP B1/Dynamics), EDI
      (810/812/820/856), retailer portals, TMS/WMS, and carrier APIs to
      normalize deduction and shipment data.
    - >-
      AI classification: Model maps chargebacks/deductions to retailer-specific
      reason codes and root causes with confidence scoring and explainability.
    - >-
      Evidence assembly: Auto-collects POD/BOL/packing lists, ASN timestamps,
      routing guide references, RTVs, vendor scorecards; auto-redacts PII where
      required.
    - >-
      Draft disputes: Generates retailer-specific dispute packets/templates with
      citations and attachments; flags missing proofs and creates tasks for
      Ops/3PLs.
    - >-
      Submission automation: Submits via API or secure portal automation (where
      available), tracks ticket/case IDs, SLAs, and due dates.
    - >-
      Recovery tracking & prevention: Dashboards for win-rate, cycle time,
      dollars recovered; prevention analytics identify repeat
      offenders/violations and recommend process fixes.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop: Analyst workbench for review/edits; continuous learning
      from outcomes to improve model precision and retailer playbooks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Recover more, faster, with less effort: StepRecover AI centralizes deduction
    data, auto-classifies root causes, assembles evidence, drafts and submits
    retailer-ready disputes, and feeds prevention insights—targeting 30–50% more
    recovery, 70%+ automation of prep, and 60–80% faster time-to-dispute within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Retailer-specific dispute playbooks and portal automation library trained on
    thousands of labeled footwear deduction cases, yielding faster, higher
    win-rate submissions; continuous learning from outcomes creates a defensible
    data moat and benchmarks that new entrants and in-house teams lack.
