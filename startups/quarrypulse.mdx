leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Excess unplanned downtime from avoidable failures (contamination,
      overheating, EGR/DPF, hydraulics) increases cost/ton and misses shipment
      deadlines.
    - >-
      Maintenance teams are overwhelmed by noisy fault codes and scattered data
      (OEM telematics, oil lab PDFs, spreadsheets, CMMS) with no unified
      prioritization.
    - >-
      Reactive maintenance dominates due to lack of risk-based triage; low-value
      PMs displace high-risk corrective actions.
    - >-
      Limited wrench-hours and parts availability across remote pits require
      better scheduling and parts pre-staging.
    - >-
      Existing OEM telematics alerting is generic; oil analysis flags are
      threshold-based and siloed; CMMS lacks condition-based work order
      prioritization.
    - >-
      Connectivity gaps and mixed-brand fleets make continuous monitoring
      difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest telematics (AEMP 2.0/OEM APIs), oil analysis, and CMMS data;
      normalize into one equipment health model.
    - >-
      Generate a daily Health Risk Score (0–100) per asset using fault code
      patterns, engine hours/idle/load, and oil trends (wear metals, viscosity,
      fuel dilution, soot, water, TAN/TBN).
    - >-
      Auto-prioritize a triage queue with recommended actions and parts lists;
      push to CMMS as prioritized work orders.
    - >-
      Detect anomalies (e.g., rising Fe/Cu with high hydraulic temp; frequent
      DPF regens with high idle) with explainable “why” and failure mode
      mapping.
    - >-
      On-site friendly workflows: offline mobile summaries, printable pick-lists
      for mechanics, SMS/email for critical assets.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard: unplanned vs scheduled work ratio, downtime hours avoided,
      cost/ton impact, labor utilization, and parts lead-time adherence.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn mixed-brand telematics and oil analysis into one risk score and a
    ranked work-order queue tailored to sand & gravel duty cycles—cutting
    unplanned downtime 20–30% within 6–9 months while increasing scheduled work
    and part availability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built triage models for aggregates that fuse oil trends with heavy
    equipment fault patterns and duty-cycle context, plus prebuilt connectors to
    the most common OEMs, labs, and CMMS—delivering explainable, prioritized
    work orders out-of-the-box rather than generic alerts. Early partner data
    access (labs/dealers) accelerates model accuracy and creates switching
    costs.

    - Goal: Keep loaders, haul trucks, crushers, and screens running; hit daily
    tons; control maintenance spend

    - Need: Clear, data-driven triage that tells technicians what to fix next
  problem: >-
    - External: Dusty duty cycles, Tier 4 aftertreatment issues, fault-code
    storms, mixed telematics, oil results stuck in PDFs, too few technicians

    - Internal: Overwhelmed by alerts and guesswork; anxious about missing an
    impending failure

    - Philosophical: Maintenance data should point to what matters now—not
    create more work
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know one unexpected failure can idle a pit and blow production
    targets

    - Authority: Built by reliability engineers and data scientists; models use
    engine hours, fault codes, and oil analysis; integrates with OEM telematics
    and leading oil labs; transparent scoring with reasons and recommended
    actions
  plan: |-
    Process:
      1) Connect: API to your telematics and oil lab; map assets and meters
      2) Score: AI assigns health and failure risk; auto-prioritizes work orders with root-cause clues
      3) Act: Sync to your CMMS; techs get next-best actions and watchlists
    Agreement:
      - Keep your current CMMS workflow
      - Enterprise-grade security and data privacy
      - Pilot with clear success criteria and cancel anytime
  callToAction: >-

  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned crusher, screen, or loader failures halt production and spike
      cost per ton.
    - >-
      Fault codes, engine hours, and oil reports are siloed; triage is slow and
      manual.
    - Time-based PMs miss emerging risks and over-service low-risk assets.
    - Tech capacity is limited; low-impact work orders crowd the queue.
    - Parts delays and poor scheduling extend downtime windows.
    - 'No clear, fleet-wide view of component health or failure risk.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Unify telematics and oil lab data into a single health view per asset and
      component.
    - AI health scores and risk trends highlight what will fail and when.
