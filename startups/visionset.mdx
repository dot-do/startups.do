  title: Vision QC for Saw-Tooth Defects and Set-Angle Measurement
  description: >-
    AI inspects blade teeth for chips, braze defects, set-angle variance, burrs,
    and missing teeth from uploaded images or short videos.
  targetUsers:
    - Quality managers
    - Manufacturing engineers
    - Cell supervisors
  triggers:
    - Batch images uploaded after grinding/setting
    - Hourly camera capture on line
    - Manual recheck request
  inputs:
    - 20–100 labeled images per part family (good/defect)
    - Camera calibration image (checkerboard)
    - 'Part metadata (SKU, tooth count, nominal set/kerf)'
    - Gauge R&R reference measurements (optional)
  steps:
    - Collect and label sample images by defect type
    - >-
      Train and validate YOLO/segmentation model; calibrate angle/kerf
      measurement using fiducials
    - Deploy lightweight inference app; define pass/fail thresholds per SKU
    - Run inference on new batches; queue borderline cases for human review
    - 'Log SPC features (set-angle mean/σ, defect rate) and generate alerts'
    - Active-learning loop to retrain monthly with reviewed cases
  tools:
    - Ultralytics YOLOv8
    - OpenCV
    - Roboflow (labeling)
    - FastAPI/Streamlit app
    - PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
    - Grafana/Power BI
  outputs:
    - Per-blade pass/fail and defect classification
    - 'Per-batch SPC report (Cp/Cpk, control charts)'
    - Set-angle and kerf distributions (CSV + dashboard)
    - Alert emails/Slack for drifts
  pricingModel:
    - 'Setup fee (dataset and model): $6k–$20k depending on SKUs'
    - 'Usage: $0.01–$0.05 per image or $500–$2k/month flat'
    - 'Optional human review: $0.10 per flagged image'
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Lighting variability causing false results
    - Need for initial labels and periodic re-labeling
    - Safety/liability if relying solely on AI without QC signoff
    - Data/IP sensitivity of images
  dependencies:
    - Sample images and defect taxonomy
    - Shop-floor photo station or line camera
    - Access to SPC repository (optional)
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or gauge-based inspection of saw teeth is slow, inconsistent, and
      non-traceable, leading to 2–5% false rejects and 1–3% escapes on typical
      lines.
    - >-
      Measuring set-angle per tooth is labor-intensive (typ. 3–10 min/blade) and
      varies by operator; most shops only sample 1–5% of output, missing drift
      and setup issues.
    - >-
      Carbide braze defects, micro-chipping, burrs, and missing teeth often
      appear after heat/finish processes; detection late in the line drives
      scrap, rework, and returns, costing $10–$50 per blade or more in
      rework/credits.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI models detect chips (>100 µm), braze voids/overflows, burrs (~50–100
      µm), missing teeth, and set-angle variance from uploaded images or short
      videos.
    - >-
      Per-tooth measurement: left/right set-angle in degrees,
      runout/variability, and defect classification heatmaps with thresholds for
      pass/fail.
    - >-
      Calibration workflow (checker target + lens profile) achieving ±0.25–0.5°
      set-angle MAE at 1080p with proper lighting; gage R&R target <10%.
    - >-
      Fast workflow: 10–30 seconds per blade (60–120 teeth) with batch upload or
      inline camera trigger; API/SDK for PLC/MES (OPC UA/MQTT/REST).
    - >-
      Digital traceability: per-tooth records, photo/video evidence, lot
      linkage, SPC charts, and automated COQ reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    100% visual QC for saw teeth that measures set-angle and catches tooth-level
    defects in seconds, with per-tooth traceability and simple camera
    setups—cutting escapes and inspection time by 50–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific models and datasets for saw teeth and set-angle measurement
    (including synthetic generators and calibration IP), plus OEM partnerships
    that enable turnkey, validated deployments competitors can’t easily
    replicate.
  customerSegments:

    - >-
      Unit economics example: 15 s 1080p video, 300 frames, ~6 s GPU time at
      $2.00/GPU-hr ≈ $0.0033 inference + $0.002 storage/egress ≈ $0.005–$0.02
      COGS per inspection.

  character: >-
    QC leaders, process engineers, and plant managers at saw-blade and hand tool
    manufacturers (NAICS 332216) who need fast, objective, 100% inspection of
    tooth geometry and braze quality to protect throughput and brand.
  problem: >-
    Manual inspection is slow and subjective; micro-defects—chips, braze voids,
    set-angle variance, burrs, missing teeth—slip through, driving scrap,
    rework, warranty claims, safety risk, and audit gaps. Quality shouldn’t
    depend on tired eyes.
  guide: >-
    We understand 332216 workflows; our vision AI is trained on thousands of
    blade and hand-tool images, validated against ISO/ANSI tolerances, and
    deployed securely alongside your QC with proven ROI and fast onboarding.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload images or short videos, or connect a line-side camera. 2) Receive
    instant defect flags, set-angle measurements, and pass/fail with annotated
    evidence. 3) Export traceable reports and integrate results with MES/ERP;
    tune thresholds to your specs.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo and start a 14-day pilot; request our camera guide and
    sample upload link today.
  success: >-
    Achieve 100% tooth inspection, faster changeovers, less scrap and rework,
    fewer escapes and recalls, auditable compliance, safer products, happier
    customers, and higher margins.
  failure: >-
    Keep relying on spot checks and tired eyes; defects escape; face returns,
    lost contracts, compliance findings, and margin erosion.

    title: Vision QC for Saw-Tooth Defects & Set‑Angle
    subtitle: >-
      AI inspects blade teeth for chips, braze defects, set‑angle variance,
      burrs, and missing teeth from images or short videos. Built for Saw Blade
      & Handtool Manufacturing (NAICS 332216).
    ctaText: Try the Demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - 'Manual tooth inspection is slow, subjective, and costly.'
    - Micro-defects and set‑angle drift are missed at line speed.
    - 'Late discovery drives rework, scrap, and warranty risk.'
    - Inconsistent records make audits and traceability painful.
    - 'Glare, burrs, and SKU changes break generic vision tools.'
    - Camera and MES/PLC integrations are complex and brittle.
  solution:
    - Upload photos or short videos; get per‑tooth pass/fail and measurements.
    - 'Detect chips, braze voids, burrs, and missing teeth with visual overlays.'
    - Quantify set‑angle tooth‑by‑tooth with tolerance checks.
    - 'Export CSV/PDF for QA, customers, and audit trails.'
    - Deploy at benches or inline; integrate via API with MES/PLC.
    - 'Models tuned to your SKUs, finishes, and lighting conditions.'
    - 'Reduce scrap, standardize QC across shifts, and speed throughput.'
  features:
    - 'Per‑tooth defect detection: chips, braze defects, burrs, missing teeth.'
    - Set‑angle measurement with tolerance bands and auto‑flagging.
    - Video-to-frame sampling for moving blades; motion blur handling.
    - Calibration with reference gauge or checkerboard (one‑time or per shift).
    - 'Glare/lighting normalization for carbide, HSS, and coated surfaces.'
    - 'Multi‑SKU profiles: tooth count, pitch, kerf, diameter, left/right set.'
    - 'Operator overlays: defect markers, angle arrows, rework guidance.'
    - Batch and real‑time modes with queue management for cells/lines.
    - 'Traceability: lot/serial capture, timestamps, and immutable audit logs.'
    - 'Reporting: CSV of measurements, PDF certificates of conformance.'
    - 'Connectors: REST API, OPC UA/MQTT for PLC/MES/ERP integration.'
    - 'Flexible deployment: on‑prem or private cloud; data stays in your control.'
  steps:
    - 'Create a profile: SKU, tooth count, tolerances, and set‑angle targets.'
    - 'Upload images or a 5–10s video, or connect a station camera.'
    - Optionally run quick calibration with a reference target.
    - Start inspection to receive per‑tooth results and flags.
    - 'Review overlays, approve lots, or route flagged parts to rework.'
    - Export reports or auto‑sync results to MES/ERP via API.
    - Continuously improve by approving model suggestions with your feedback.
