leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow speed-to-lead: inbound web form and missed-call leads go cold within
      minutes; most offices don’t respond after-hours/weekends, causing 30–50%
      lead leakage.
    - >-
      High time sink on unqualified inquiries (small repairs,
      out-of-service-area, not ready to buy), leading to wasted truck rolls and
      low close rates.
    - >-
      Sticker shock at the home: no early budget alignment; sales reps drive to
      appointments that never had a chance, increasing CAC and opportunity cost.
    - >-
      Expensive and slow measurements (e.g., HOVER/EagleView) used too early
      just to prequalify; adds $50–$100 and 1–24 hours before a price
      conversation can start.
    - >-
      Inconsistent intake: office staff vary in scripts, miss key info (address,
      photos, material preference), and struggle with bilingual communication.
    - >-
      Scheduling friction: back-and-forth to find times, no-shows from poor
      reminders, and re-scheduling chaos.
    - >-
      Fragmented channels (webchat, SMS, Facebook, Google Business Messages);
      missed-call texts aren’t automated; CRM data capture is incomplete.
    - >-
      Limited data visibility: owners can’t see which marketing channels
      generate qualified, booked, and closed jobs; hard to optimize spend.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy an always-on chat + SMS agent across website, Google Business
      Messages, Facebook, and missed-call text-back.
    - >-
      Run a structured qualification flow: capture address, project scope
      (replace vs repair), material preference, stories/square footage cues,
      timing, budget sensitivity, and lead source.
    - >-
      Auto-enrich the address: property type, footprint, stories, year built,
      lot/building perimeter; prompt for photos to refine complexity.
    - >-
      Estimate siding area using building footprints, story height heuristics,
      and optional oblique/parcel imagery; apply contractor’s price book
      (materials, removal, wrap, trim/soffit/fascia adders, regional factors) to
      return a ballpark range with clear assumptions.
    - >-
      If the range matches budget/interest, offer times directly from connected
      calendars, send confirmations, and push the record to the CRM with
      transcript, photos, and estimate context.
    - >-
      Provide analytics: funnel from inquiry → qualified → set → held → sold,
      after-hours capture, estimate accuracy vs closed contracts, and ROI by
      channel.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn every siding inquiry into a conversation within seconds. Qualify,
    collect photos, generate a credible ballpark from imagery, and book the
    appointment automatically—reducing windshield time and increasing set rates,
    24/7.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, siding-specific estimation and pricing dataset
    tied to real closed deals across markets. This feedback loop calibrates
    local price ranges and complexity factors better than generic chatbots or
    human-only answering services. Combined with multi-channel intake,
    CRM-native workflows, and manufacturer/distributor partnerships, it creates
    defensible accuracy, faster payback, and strong switching costs.
