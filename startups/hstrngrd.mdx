  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime (3–8% OEE loss) in reactors/distillation due to
      undetected drifts and interactions across variables; every hour of
      downtime can cost $20k–$150k depending on product mix.
    - >-
      Off-spec batches (2–5% of production) from subtle multivariate shifts and
      grade transitions drive scrap/rework, lost margin, emissions, and customer
      complaints (often $0.5M–$2M per plant per year).
    - >-
      Conventional alarms are threshold-based and univariate; they miss
      cross-variable patterns and create alarm floods/false positives during
      transitions (alarm fatigue).
    - >-
      Historians (OSIsoft PI, Aspen IP.21, Honeywell PHD) hold years of data but
      are underutilized; in-house modeling is slow, brittle, and dependent on
      scarce data science expertise.
    - >-
      Energy overconsumption (1–3%) from operating away from optimal envelopes
      across columns and heat-integrated networks, exacerbated during feed
      changes and fouling.
    - >-
      Limited early-warning time window for safety/environmental excursions
      (e.g., column flooding, runaway reaction precursors), leading to flaring
      and permit deviations.
    - >-
      Difficulty scaling models across units, recipes, and sites; no
      standardized model governance, retraining, or MOC integration.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-intrusive historian connectors (PI, IP.21, PHD) stream contextualized
      time-series to build unit-level multivariate models (MSPC/PCA-PLS +
      temporal deep learning) per grade/recipe and operating mode.
    - >-
      Golden-batch and normal-operating-envelope modeling for reactors/columns
      with automatic detection of regime shifts (startups, grade changes,
      cleaning, fouling).
    - >-
      Early-warning scoring with lead-time estimates, confidence, and root-cause
      contributions by tag/variable; explainable alerts via contribution plots
      and SHAP-like attributions.
    - >-
      Operator workflow integration: alerts to PI Vision/AVEVA, DCS alarm banner
      (via OPC UA), email/SMS, and CMMS (SAP PM/Maximo) for follow-up work
      orders.
    - >-
      Closed-loop model lifecycle: drift monitoring, automated retraining with
      human-in-the-loop approval, full audit trail and MOC alignment.
    - >-
      Edge option for on-prem/OT networks with store-and-forward, role-based
      access, and cybersecurity (ISA/IEC 62443 practices).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Multivariate, recipe-aware early warnings that detect abnormal behavior
    30–120 minutes before traditional alarms with <2 false positives per asset
    per week, reducing off-spec by 20–40%, unplanned downtime by 10–25%, and
    energy intensity by 1–3%—with payback in <6 months and seamless integration
    to your historian, DCS, and CMMS.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Process engineers and plant managers in All Other Basic Organic Chemical
    Manufacturing (NAICS 325199) who want stable, compliant, and profitable
    operations across reactors and distillation.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Hidden multivariate interactions and slow process drift that
    traditional alarms miss.

    - External: Off-spec batches, energy waste, and unplanned downtime from
    subtle equipment, feed, and control changes.

    - Internal: Alarm fatigue and low confidence because single-variable charts
    don’t tell the whole story.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t be blindsided by process surprises when the
    data already knows.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know how a small deviation in a column or reactor can cascade
    into quality, safety, and yield losses.

    - Authority: Chemical engineers and data scientists using proven
    multivariate time-series models that plug into common historians to deliver
    reliable, low-false-alarm early warnings.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Map tags from your historian and define critical operating
    envelopes for reactors/columns.

    - Model: Train and validate multivariate baseline models on historical runs;
    set sensible alert thresholds.

    - Deploy: Stream real-time scores, trigger early warnings, and route action
    playbooks to operations.

    - Improve: Weekly tuning, governance reports, and change-management support
    with your team.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute assessment and start a targeted pilot on one
    unit.

    - Transitional: Get the readiness checklist and ROI worksheet to identify
    your highest-impact assets.
  success: >-
    - Detect abnormal behavior minutes to hours earlier, before quality and
    safety are at risk.

    - Fewer off-spec events, lower energy per ton, and reduced unplanned
    downtime.

    - Clear, auditable alerts that cut alarm noise and boost operator
    confidence.

    - Continuous improvement loop that strengthens yields, OEE, and compliance.
  failure: >-
    - Continued surprises: off-spec lots, flaring, environmental excursions, and
    urgent maintenance.

    - Mounting alarm fatigue and missed weak signals that erode margins and
    reliability.

    - More capital spent chasing symptoms instead of fixing problems early.
