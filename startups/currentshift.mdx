leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Seasonality and event-driven demand swings create either overcrowding or
      costly empty sailings across coastal and Great Lakes routes.
    - >-
      Manual, spreadsheet-based scheduling can’t jointly optimize frequency,
      departure times, and vessel assignment while honoring hard constraints
      (berth windows, crew hours, maintenance, draft limits).
    - >-
      Poor integration of ticketing, AIS, weather/ice, and maintenance data
      leads to outdated assumptions and missed savings opportunities.
    - >-
      Overtime and fuel costs are inflated by suboptimal vessel rotations,
      deadheading, and late adjustments.
    - >-
      Regulatory compliance (USCG/Transport Canada hours of rest, SOLAS,
      ADA/Accessibility, emissions caps) is hard to encode and audit in current
      tools.
    - >-
      Operators lack fast, defensible “what-if” scenario planning for seasonal
      timetables, special events, school holidays, and weather-related
      disruptions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Seasonal demand forecasting at stop-time granularity using ticketing
      history, AIS traces, tourism/events calendars, school/holiday calendars,
      weather/ice impacts, and commuter patterns.
    - >-
      Mathematical optimization (MILP/CP) that jointly selects departure times,
      headways, vessel assignments, and interlining with hard constraints (berth
      windows, draft/length limits, turnaround times, fueling, ADA/accessible
      capacity, maintenance windows, crew HOS/qualifications, union rules).
    - >-
      Scenario planning and “what-if” sandbox to compare timetables by cost,
      revenue, load factor, emissions, and SLA/OTP metrics before publishing.
    - >-
      Real-time disruption assist: re-optimize around weather, berth outages, or
      crew shortfalls; produce feasible recovery plans and passenger impact
      estimates.
    - >-
      One-click exports to GTFS-Ferries/GTFS-RT, rostering/maintenance systems,
      and ticketing platforms; auditable compliance reports for regulators and
      unions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI-driven, season-aware optimizer that co-optimizes sailing frequency,
    exact departure times, and vessel assignment to meet demand at the lowest
    total cost—while honoring maritime, crew, port, and maintenance constraints.
    Deployable in 8–10 weeks, with target outcomes of 3–8% operating cost
    reduction, 5–10 percentage-point load factor improvement, and 20–40% fewer
    deadhead hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-built maritime constraint libraries (USCG/Transport Canada HOS,
    berth/turnaround, draft/ramp limits, ice/wind/wave minima) and Great Lakes
    seasonality features, combined with proprietary cross-operator datasets that
    fuse ticketing, AIS, and weather/ice. This enables faster, more accurate
    seasonal optimization and compliant, explainable outputs that generic
    transit or fleet tools cannot match. Switching costs are reinforced by deep
    integrations and planner workflows.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ferry operations leaders (schedulers, planners, and GMs) who must deliver
    reliable, cost‑efficient seasonal service across coastal and Great Lakes
    routes.
  problem: >-
    Seasonal demand swings, tight port windows, crew rules, and limited vessels
    turn scheduling into guesswork—leading to overcrowding or empty runs, budget
    overruns, compliance risk, and frustrated riders and stakeholders who
    deserve reliable, efficient service.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of seasonality and public accountability. Our
    maritime ops and data science team has deployed constraint‑based optimizers
    for transit and ferry networks, integrating safely with existing planning,
    ticketing, and crew systems.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and constraints (routes, vessels, crews, maintenance,
    tides/ports, demand). 2) Set goals (lowest cost, on‑time performance, load
    factor, equity) and run the optimizer. 3) Review scenarios, approve, and
    publish schedules and vessel assignments; monitor and adjust with one click.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 60‑day pilot. Transitional:
    Download a sample optimization report and ROI model.
  success: >-
    Right‑sized seasonal frequency and departure times; optimal vessel
    rotations; lower fuel and overtime; higher load factors and on‑time
    performance; compliant crew rosters; happier passengers and crews; confident
    updates to boards and regulators.
  failure: >-
    Without this, teams stay stuck in brittle spreadsheets, rush last‑minute
    changes, incur fines and overtime, miss demand peaks, run empty or
    overcrowded sailings, blow budgets, and erode public trust.
