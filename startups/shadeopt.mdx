leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High re-dye rates (often 15–35%) due to batch-to-batch raw material
      variability (fiber lot, moisture, blend ratio) and manual recipe tweaking.
    - >-
      Inconsistent shade (ΔE00 > 0.8–1.0 tolerance) causing brand rejections,
      scrap, and delivery delays.
    - >-
      Rising input costs (dyes/chemicals +5–12% YoY, energy +10–20% spikes) with
      limited visibility to cost per kg per shade/batch.
    - >-
      Long lab-to-bulk cycles (1–3 days) and limited RFT (Right-First-Time)
      knowledge captured in operators’ heads; turnover risks.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (spectrophotometer, lab dips, ERP/MES, machine SCADA)
      preventing learning across recipes and processes.
    - >-
      Environmental pressure (water, effluent salinity/chemical oxygen demand)
      and compliance risks raising total landed cost.
    - >-
      Slow onboarding of new shades—shade library growth outpaces lab bandwidth,
      causing backlogs and missed orders.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer that ingests lab/bulk measurements, spectrophotometer
      readings, historical recipes, machine parameters, ERP cost data, and
      environmental metrics.
    - >-
      Hybrid ML + physics engine predicting shade outcome (ΔE00), fixation, and
      leveling; optimizes dye combinations and process parameters
      (time–temperature, salt/alkali dosing, liquor ratio, pH, dosing profiles).
    - >-
      Batch-specific recipe recommendations and on-machine correction guidance
      (e.g., top-up dye/salt/alkali, soak/hold adjustments) to salvage near-miss
      shades.
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimization balancing ΔE00, total cost per kg, cycle
      time, and effluent load with constraint handling for brand tolerances and
      mill SOPs.
    - >-
      Raw-material variability modeling (fiber lot, blend, moisture regain) with
      automatic bias correction and transfer learning across similar shades.
    - >-
      Digital shade library management (lab-to-bulk correlation, shade cards,
      tolerance rings, 3D color space visualization).
    - >-
      What-if simulator to evaluate dye brand substitutions, energy tariffs, and
      process windows before production.
    - >-
      APIs/connectors for spectrophotometers, lab dip systems, ERP/MES, and dye
      machine PLCs; optional edge gateway for low-latency shop-floor use.
    - >-
      Dashboards for RFT, ΔE distribution, cost/water/energy per kg, and
      operator coaching; audit trails for brand compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit target shade within tolerance (e.g., ΔE00 ≤ 0.8–1.0) on the first bulk
    attempt at the lowest total cost. ShadeOpt blends physics-based dyeing
    models with mill-specific ML to recommend dye recipes and process parameters
    that cut re-dyes 30–60%, reduce dye/chemical cost 3–8%, and lower
    water/energy 5–15%, while compressing lab-to-bulk time by 25–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, cross-mill learning corpus and hybrid physics+ML models tuned
    for yarn/package dyeing enable accurate ΔE00 prediction and cost-optimized
    recipes under real-world variability. Federated learning captures patterns
    across mills without sharing raw data. Deep integrations with
    spectrophotometers and machine PLCs enable closed-loop corrections that
    commodity lab software and ERP modules lack. Documented ROI from rapid
    pilots and growing benchmark datasets create defensibility and switching
    costs.

  character: >-
    Color managers and dyehouse teams at fiber, yarn, and thread mills who must
    hit brand shade targets (ΔE within tolerance) at the lowest cost and lead
    time.
  problem: >-
    Trial-and-error shade matching wastes dye, water, and energy, drives re-dyes
    and missed ship dates, and risks inconsistency across fibers, dye classes,
    machines, and lots—while teams feel pressured to deliver perfect color
    without guesswork or waste.
  guide: >-
    We understand mill realities—variable substrates, aged equipment, mixed dye
    lots—and the pressure to achieve right-first-time color. Our AI, built by
    dyeing and color-science engineers, learns from your lab and bulk runs to
    deliver validated, mill-tested recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect spectro/ERP data and define shade bands, costs, and constraints.
    2) Receive optimized dye recipes and process tweaks with predicted ΔE, cost,
    and risk. 3) Run, measure, and improve as the model adapts to your machines
    for higher RFT.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot on priority shades.
    Transitional: Download a sample optimization report and run the ROI
    calculator.
  success: >-
    First-time-right shade hits, fewer re-dyes, lower dyestuff/aux/water/energy
    use, faster lab-to-bulk, stable costs, and confident brand approvals—color
    on target, every time.
  failure: >-
    Continued firefighting—over-dyes, rejected lots, blown lead times, excess
    chemical and utility spend, and burned-out teams.
