leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual scheduling in spreadsheets takes 3–8 hours/week/line and still
      misses rush orders and truck dates.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent changeovers (species, thickness, width, grade,
      moisture, knife/profile/kerf changes) consume 15–30% of shift time when
      poorly sequenced.
    - >-
      Late orders (typical OTD 78–90%) cause expediting, overtime, and margin
      erosion; planners lack a due-date weighted optimizer.
    - >-
      Schedules are not finite-capacity; they overcommit machines, labor, and
      kiln/conditioning constraints, creating fire drills.
    - >-
      Inaccurate or tribal knowledge of setup times (true changeovers vary
      30–60%) leads to unstable schedules and frequent re-plans.
    - >-
      Disconnected data (ERP/MES/shop-floor) leads to wrong
      inventory/availability; planners cannot simulate what-if or run fast
      re-optimizations.
    - >-
      No standard way to coordinate saw/resaw/planer as a multi-stage flow, so
      WIP piles up and yields suffer.
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based APS engine tailored to lumber operations:
      sequence-dependent setups by species, thickness, width, grade, moisture,
      and tooling (blades/knives).
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling across multiple resources (machines, crews,
      kilns/conditioning, forklifts) with shift and maintenance calendars.
    - >-
      Due-date weighted tardiness minimization with penalty costs; configurable
      to customer priorities (OTD vs. changeover vs. WIP).
    - >-
      Changeover matrix builder and ML-estimated setup times from historical
      runs; continuously learns to tighten estimates.
    - >-
      Real-time re-planning on events (rush order, machine down, stockout);
      preserves schedule stability with minimal necessary moves.
    - >-
      ERP/MES connectors (LumberTrack, DMSi Agility, MillTech, Microsoft BC,
      custom SQL/CSV/API) and shop-floor dispatch lists (web/mobile).
    - >-
      What-if simulation: compare sequences, batch sizes, overtime, and truck
      loading plans with KPI deltas before releasing to floor.
    - >-
      Visual line balance across saw→resaw→planer with WIP caps and buffer
      targets to avoid starvation/blockage.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate stable, finite-capacity schedules for saws, resaws, and planers in
    minutes that hit due dates and cut changeovers 20–40%, lifting OTD to 95%+
    and throughput 3–8% without capital spend.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained optimizer and setup-time ML models pre-calibrated for NAICS
    321912 (species/thickness/grade/moisture/tooling), plus out-of-the-box ERP
    connectors and changeover matrices that generate value in the first 30 days;
    growing network effect from anonymized setup and performance data improves
    recommendations over time.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant, production, and scheduling managers at cut‑stock, resaw, and planing
    mills who must promise and hit ship dates every week.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile order mix, long changeovers, limited machine and crew
    capacity across saws, resaws, and planers. Internal: constant firefighting
    with spreadsheets and whiteboards, overtime, and frustrated crews.
    Philosophical: skilled woodworkers shouldn’t lose margin—or sleep—because
    the schedule can’t respect real constraints.
  guide: >-
    We understand the puzzle of species, thickness, knife and blade sets,
    routings, crews, maintenance, and due dates. Our constraint‑based AI
    scheduler for NAICS 321912 brings proven operations research and
    mill‑specific rules to cut changeovers and raise on‑time delivery,
    integrating with your ERP/MES and floor reality.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: import orders, routings, setup/changeover matrices, calendars,
    and inventory. 2) Configure: encode constraints and rules (species,
    thickness, knife/blade sets, crews, maintenance windows). 3) Run and
    publish: generate daily/weekly, changeover‑aware schedules, review
    exceptions, and release to the floor with clear run lists. Risk‑free pilot
    with defined success metrics.
  callToAction: Book a 30‑minute demo and start a 4‑week pilot on one line.
  success: >-
    A stable, changeover‑aware schedule that meets due dates, reduces setups and
    overtime, increases throughput and yield, gives sales reliable lead times,
    and lets crews know exactly what to run next.
  failure: >-
    Without it: more expediting, missed ship dates, wasted setup time, blown
    margins and overtime, underused machines, stressed teams, and customers who
    stop trusting your promises.
