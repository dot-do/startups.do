leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High manual effort to triage and key data from incoming claim documents
      (email, fax, portals, mailroom scans) leads to 5–15 minutes of handling
      per document and inconsistent quality.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous formats (ACORD notices, estimate exports from
      Xactimate/CCC/Mitchell, CMS-1500/UB-04 medical bills, repair invoices,
      police reports) defeat template OCR; new templates constantly appear.
    - >-
      Data quality issues (missing/incorrect VINs, dates, line items, payee
      info) cause leakage, rework, payment delays, and customer dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Sparse integration between intake tools and claim core systems (Guidewire,
      Duck Creek, Origami, EIS) results in swivel-chair work and latency.
    - >-
      Regulatory and privacy constraints (PII/PHI in workers’ comp) raise
      compliance and audit burdens for in-house AI and generic OCR tools.
    - >-
      Spiky volumes (CAT events) overwhelm manual teams and BPO SLAs, increasing
      cycle time and overtime costs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Omnichannel ingestion: API, secure email ingestion, SFTP, and
      watched-bucket for scanned mailroom/eFax; automated de-duplication and
      thread grouping by claim.
    - >-
      Insurance-tuned classification models that identify document type, line of
      business, and party (e.g., estimate, medical bill, police report, lien,
      invoice).
    - >-
      Field-level extraction with confidence scoring and schema mapping for
      common insurance artifacts (FNOL notices, estimate line items,
      CMS-1500/UB-04, repair invoices, statements).
    - >-
      Business-rule validation (dates in range, VIN check digit, policy/claim
      number regex, line-item totals, CPT/HCPCS normalization, tax and
      depreciation checks).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop verification UI with queueing, sampling, and quality
      workflows for your team or BPO partners; continuous active learning from
      corrections.
    - >-
      Prebuilt connectors and adapters to Guidewire ClaimCenter, Duck Creek
      Claims, Origami Risk, Hyland OnBase, OpenText, and event/webhook patterns.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II, encryption at rest/in transit,
      SSO/SAML, RBAC, field redaction, optional HIPAA BAA for workers’ comp and
      medical bills.
    - >-
      Observability and ROI: dashboards for SLA compliance, accuracy by
      field/type, exception rates, and per-claim/doc cycle times.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Insurance-native document AI that auto-classifies and extracts
    high-accuracy, field-validated claim data from any inbound document and
    delivers structured, mapped payloads to your claim system—cutting document
    handling time by 60–80%, enabling 50–70% no-touch posting, and reducing
    leakage with auditable quality controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Insurance-first models and validation rules trained on a large,
    de-identified corpus across P&C and workers’ comp; prebuilt, certified
    connectors to major claim systems; field-level QA and audit trails aligned
    to regulator expectations; and partner-enabled delivery with BPOs that
    provide immediate surge capacity without new vendors.

  character: >-
    Claims operations leaders at carriers, TPAs, MGAs, and insurtechs who want
    straight‑through processing from incoming claim documents to their claim
    systems without manual data entry.
  problem: >-
    - External: Claims arrive as ACORD forms, estimates, invoices, and reports
    in many formats; staff rekey data across systems; errors and backlogs grow.

    - Internal: Teams are overwhelmed by swivel‑chair work, slow cycle times,
    and audit headaches.

    - Philosophical: Adjusters should resolve claims—not copy data; claimants
    deserve faster, fairer outcomes.

    - Villain: Unstructured document chaos and legacy intake workflows that
    don’t scale.
  guide: >-
    We understand the complexity of insurance documents and claim workflows. Our
    team has deep insurance and AI experience, with models trained on common
    claims artifacts (ACORD, estimates, invoices, reports). We integrate with
    leading claim systems, prioritize security and compliance, and deliver
    transparent, auditable results.
  plan: |-
    - Process Plan:
      1) Connect your inbox/SFTP/API
      2) Auto‑classify and extract key fields with AI
      3) Normalize to your data model
      4) Push structured data to claim systems; queue exceptions
      5) Monitor accuracy with dashboards and feedback loops
    - Agreement Plan:
      • Data privacy and security by design
      • Confidence scores and human‑in‑the‑loop for exceptions
      • Clear SLAs and audit trails
      • No disruption to upstream vendors

  success: >-
    Straight‑through intake; faster cycle times; fewer errors and rework;
    adjusters focused on adjudication; lower LAE and leakage; happier
    policyholders; clean, searchable structured data fueling analytics and
    compliance.
  failure: >-
    Manual rekeying persists, backlogs grow, SLAs are missed, errors trigger
    rework and compliance risk, adjusters burn out, and policyholder experience
    suffers.
