  problem:
    - >-
      Manual daily routing on whiteboards/spreadsheets takes 1–3 hours per
      branch and relies on tribal knowledge.
    - >-
      Inaccurate ETAs and poor communication drive high WISMO calls (40–100
      calls per 100 orders) and unhappy contractors waiting at jobsites.
    - >-
      Pickups are reactive and under-optimized, leaving high-value gear idle
      longer and delaying re-rental revenue.
    - >-
      Inefficient routes waste 10–25% miles/fuel and cause overtime; on-time
      performance often <75%.
    - >-
      Capacity, load/unload times, driver skills, and equipment constraints
      (e.g., boom length, liftgate, weight/volume) are not accounted for in
      simple tools.
    - >-
      Lack of live re-optimization when jobs run long, gates are closed, or
      traffic spikes, leading to cascading delays.
    - Limited POD/photographic proof creates billing disputes and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Compliance and deliverability hurdles for business texting (10DLC/TCPA)
      slow adoption and create risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Dispatcher console: one-click daily route plans with rental-specific
      constraints (capacity, equipment handling, driver skills, time windows,
      yard sequencing).
    - >-
      Live ETA engine: combines GPS, real-time traffic, historical dwell times
      by equipment/jobsite, and driver behavior to predict ETAs within ±5–10
      minutes.
    - >-
      Automated customer messaging: branded SMS with opt-in management, live
      tracking links, two-way replies (e.g., gate code, reschedule), and
      proactive delay notices.
    - >-
      Pickup optimizer: batches pickups with deliveries, prioritizes high-value
      assets, auto-suggests windows to shorten idle time.
    - >-
      Driver app (iOS/Android): turn-by-turn, digital load list, photos,
      signatures, geofenced check-in/out, damage notations.
    - >-
      Exception management: detects overruns, no-access, or missed windows;
      auto-resequences routes and updates customers/dispatch.
    - >-
      Integrations: native connectors to rental ERPs (orders, stops, assets) and
      telematics feeds (GPS, ELD).
    - >-
      Analytics: on-time rate, ETA accuracy, miles/stop, stops/route, dwell
      times by site/equipment, driver productivity, WISMO volume.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI routing built for rental operations that plans and re-optimizes
    delivery/pickup routes in minutes and auto-texts accurate ETAs, cutting
    miles 15–25%, WISMO calls 60–80%, and lifting on-time performance to 95%+
    within 30 days. Typical 10‑truck branch saves $10k–$18k/month in fuel,
    labor, and avoided delays.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized routing and ETA models trained on rental-specific dwell times
    and constraints, plus prebuilt, two-way integrations to major rental ERPs
    and telematics. Combined with pre-approved, compliant business texting
    (10DLC) and a growing network of jobsite metadata, this yields uniquely
    accurate ETAs and faster deployments than general-purpose route tools.
  customerSegments:
