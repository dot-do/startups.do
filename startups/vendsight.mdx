leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and slow detection of outages across distributed fleets
      leads to lost sales and SLA penalties; many operators learn of issues only
      when a location complains.
    - >-
      Payment device failures (card reader offline, bill validator jams, low
      coin float) reduce cashless acceptance and conversion; existing alerts are
      noisy and lack root-cause clarity.
    - >-
      Temperature excursions in refrigerated machines cause product spoilage,
      health-code risks, and brand damage; compliance logs are manual and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      High cost and inefficiency of truck rolls ($75–$150 per visit); low
      first-time-fix rate due to unclear symptoms and missing parts information.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across VMS, payment providers, and OEM telemetry;
      operators lack the data science capability to turn raw telemetry into
      predictive insights.
    - >-
      Existing systems provide threshold-based alerts but limited predictive
      maintenance, leading to alert fatigue and missed early warnings.
    - >-
      Operators struggle to prioritize service tickets by revenue impact and
      risk, leading to suboptimal dispatching and inventory planning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from payment readers, VMS, and machine controllers
      (DEX/MDB) into a vendor-agnostic time-series platform.
    - >-
      Anomaly detection and predictive models for payment failures, temperature
      control, vend motor issues, and communications health—tuned per-machine
      and per-site.
    - >-
      Root-cause suggestions with parts lists, likely fix steps, and confidence
      scores; auto-attach recent telemetry and photos in tickets.
    - >-
      Dispatch prioritization by revenue-at-risk, compliance risk (cold food),
      and SLA; integrate with VMS ticketing to create/route work orders
      automatically.
    - >-
      24/7 monitoring with multi-channel alerts (SMS, email, push, webhook);
      configurable sensitivity and quiet hours by location.
    - >-
      Food safety compliance: auto-generate temperature logs, excursion alerts,
      and audit-ready reports.
    - >-
      Outcome reporting: downtime minutes avoided, spoilage prevented,
      acceptance uplift, MTTR improvements, model precision/recall.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict problems before they stop sales. VendSight AI turns vending
    telemetry into action: detect outages in minutes, predict failing parts days
    in advance, and guide technicians with root-cause suggestions—cutting
    downtime by up to 30%, truck rolls by 10–20%, and spoilage by 50% while
    boosting cashless acceptance 1–3%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-operator failure signature network and closed-loop outcome data that
    continuously improves predictive accuracy, combined with broad,
    vendor-agnostic integrations and compliance-grade temperature
    logging—difficult for single-ecosystem providers to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Vending machine operators and route managers who want every machine earning
    and compliant—without constant firefighting.
  problem: >-
    Silent outages, payment failures, temperature excursions, and surprise part
    breakdowns steal sales and trust. Operators feel blind and reactive, burning
    money on emergency truck rolls. Machines should surface issues and fixes
    before customers notice.
  guide: >-
    We understand the grind of uptime. Our AI monitors telemetry, payments, and
    temperature 24/7, flags anomalies, and recommends likely root causes—built
    by vending ops and IoT engineers and proven across mixed fleets.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your machines and payment gateways (no rip-and-replace). 2)
    Receive prioritized alerts with root-cause suggestions and tickets via API.
    3) Prevent failures, schedule fixes, and track ROI.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on your toughest routes, or request a free fleet health
    report.
  success: >-
    More uptime and revenue, fewer truck rolls and refunds, reduced spoilage,
    temperature compliance, and a shift from reactive to predictive maintenance.
  failure: >-
    Without it: hidden downtime, frustrated customers, compliance risk, and
    rising service costs that drain route profitability.
