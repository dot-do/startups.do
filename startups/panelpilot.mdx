  problem:
    - >-
      Prefab wood component manufacturers lose 8–20 hours per project converting
      architect/structural plans into constructible wall/roof/floor panels and
      BOMs.
    - >-
      Manual panelization and BOM creation are error-prone, leading to 1–5%
      material over/under-ordering and jobsite delays.
    - >-
      Existing CAD/BIM tools require scarce expert operators (Revit + add-ins,
      MWF, hsbcad, Vertex BD, SAPPHIRE); hiring/training costs are high and
      throughput is constrained.
    - >-
      Turnaround time from bid-to-shop files is too slow (3–10 days), limiting
      bid capacity and factory utilization.
    - >-
      Inconsistent standards and templates across projects create quality drift;
      knowledge leaves with staff turnover.
    - >-
      Light structural/code checks are often skipped due to time pressure,
      causing RFIs/rework in the plant or field.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI ingests PDFs/DWGs/RVT/IFC, classifies sheets, extracts geometry/specs,
      and auto-frames to plant standards (stud spacing, plates, headers,
      sheathing patterns).
    - >-
      Generates panel maps, shop drawings, cut lists, and consolidated BOM
      aligned to the customer’s SKU catalog; includes alternates and waste
      factors.
    - >-
      Exports to CNC/production formats (BTL/BTLx, Hundegger, Weinmann/Randek
      CSV, saw lists), plus Revit/IFC for coordination and Procore/BIM 360
      attachments.
    - >-
      Light checks: prescriptive IRC/IBC 2308 conformity hints (braced wall
      lines, panel aspect ratios, jack/king stud counts from span tables,
      bearing/transfer continuity, minimum nailing schedules, tie-down
      placeholders, diaphragm boundary nailing, fireblocking). Flags issues and
      generates RFIs—not a sealed design.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA: senior panelization tech reviews/edits with
      rule-based constraints; change log with version control to support
      revisions.
    - >-
      Plant templates: onboarding creates customer-specific framing rules,
      sheathing libraries, panel sizing rules, label schemas, and SKU mappings
      (e.g., LP, Weyerhaeuser, Simpson).
    - >-
      Change management: delta detection across plan revisions; re-panels only
      affected areas; updates BOM diffs for procurement.
    - >-
      Analytics: compares engineered BOM vs as-built/POs; highlights cost
      variance and recurring design issues.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From architects’ plans to CNC-ready wall/roof/floor panels and BOM in under
    24 hours—plant-calibrated templates, vendor-agnostic exports, and built-in
    light code/constructability checks. Cut engineering time by 70%, reduce BOM
    variance below 2%, and quote more jobs without adding headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Plant-calibrated framing templates plus vendor-agnostic CNC/ERP exports,
    trained on a proprietary dataset of US wood-frame projects with
    human-in-the-loop QA. Speed-to-output (<24h) with measurable BOM variance
    control (<2%) and direct OEM/ISV integrations that are costly for newcomers
    to replicate.

  character: >-
    Prefab wood building manufacturers (NAICS 321992)—panel shops, modular
    builders, and their ops/engineering teams needing fast, accurate
    panelization and BOMs from architect plans.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual panelization and takeoffs are slow, error‑prone, and hard
    to scale; drawings vary by architect; CNC/ERP handoffs break. Internal:
    Teams are stretched, deadlines slip, and rework risks margins.
    Philosophical: Builders should build—software should handle repetitive
    drafting and counting.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the prefab workflow and know the bottlenecks from plan
    to shop. Authority: AI purpose‑built for wall/roof/floor panelization with
    BOM and light structural checks; integrates with common CAD/BIM tools;
    secure with responsive support and sample outputs on request.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload plans (PDF/CAD/BIM). 2) AI generates constructible
    panels, shop‑ready BOM, and light checks. 3) Review in browser, adjust
    rules, export to CNC/ERP/shop drawings. Agreement: Start with a pilot
    project, fixed pricing, clear SLA and data security.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot on your next project.
    Transitional: Send a plan set for a free sample output and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Hours to panelized models instead of weeks; accurate BOMs; fewer shop
    errors; faster bids; higher throughput; standardized panels; on‑time
    deliveries; stronger margins and happier crews.
  failure: >-
    Status quo: slow manual takeoffs, inconsistent panels, miscuts and change
    orders, missed bid windows, schedule slips, margin erosion, and burned‑out
    teams.
