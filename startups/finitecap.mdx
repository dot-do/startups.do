leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Planners rely on spreadsheets/whiteboards and ERP infinite-capacity
      modules that don’t reflect true shop constraints (shared tools, finite
      ovens, limited racks, color changeovers).
    - >-
      Rush orders and color changes cause constant resequencing; schedule churn
      creates overtime, missed due dates, and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Lack of accurate WIP visibility across saw, CNC, welding, powder coat, and
      assembly leads to poor promise dates and idle time at bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Powder coat lines and batch-dependent operations are not modeled well by
      generic APS tools; color/chemistry changeovers and cure times are ignored,
      increasing scrap and rework.
    - >-
      Sales can’t give reliable Available-to-Promise/Capable-to-Promise
      (ATP/CTP) dates during quoting; commitments slip, hurting GC/installer
      relationships.
    - >-
      Outsourced finishing and glass deliveries create variable lead times not
      included in schedules; knock-on delays ripple through downstream
      workcenters.
    - >-
      Data from machines (CNC, saws, ovens) are siloed, delaying
      actual-versus-plan feedback; schedule adherence is unknown until it’s too
      late.
  solution:
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling engine that models routings across saw → CNC →
      welding → powder coat → assembly with realistic calendars, shifts, and
      setup/cleanup times.
    - >-
      Batching optimization that minimizes color and profile changeovers; models
      oven, rack, and hang time constraints with cure time windows.
    - >-
      Real-time WIP and queue projections by workcenter; automatic dispatch
      lists for operators with start/finish times.
    - >-
      ATP/CTP promise-date engine for sales and project management; simulations
      to assess rush-order impact before committing.
    - >-
      Automatic rescheduling on events (machine downtime, late supplier/glass
      arrival, urgent job); preserves stability with minimal necessary changes.
    - >-
      What-if scenario planning for overtime, cross-training, and subcontracting
      to hit delivery dates at least cost.
    - >-
      Integrations to ERP/MES (e.g., JobBOSS2, E2, Epicor, NetSuite, Dynamics),
      barcode scans, and selected machine data (CNC, saws, oven PLCs).

  character: >-
    Plant managers, schedulers, and operations leaders at metal window & door
    manufacturers who need reliable promise dates and smooth, constraint-aware
    flow.
  problem: >-
    - External: Complex, interdependent flow across saw, CNC, welding, powder
    coat, and assembly with finite machines, labor, and changeovers.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting, no trustworthy WIP view, pressure to
    promise dates without confidence.

    - Philosophical: Scheduling shouldn’t be guesswork—every job deserves a
    realistic plan and delivery date.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of make-to-order metal fabrication. Our AI applies
    proven finite-capacity optimization and live shop data to create executable
    schedules and accurate WIP/delivery forecasts—backed by real-world results
    and rapid deployment.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Integrate ERP/BOM, routings, work centers, calendars, and WIP
    signals.

    2) Configure: Model constraints (capacity, skills, setups, color batching,
    shift patterns) and business rules.

    3) Run & Improve: Generate daily finite schedules, WIP and delivery
    projections; review exceptions; iterate via weekly tuning.
  callToAction: |-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute discovery call to scope a 4‑week pilot.
    Transitional: Get a sample schedule, WIP forecast demo, and ROI estimate.
  success: |-
    - On‑time delivery up 15–30% with trustworthy promise dates.
    - WIP 20–40% lower and fewer hot jobs/expedites.
    - Planner time cut 30–50% with automated, constraint-aware schedules.
    - Better utilization and flow across saw/CNC/welding/powder/assembly.
    - Clear, proactive visibility into WIP and delivery risks.
  failure: >-
    Without this, planners keep guessing; bottlenecks whipsaw between idle and
    overloaded; WIP swells; due dates slip; expedites erode margins and customer
    trust.

  problem:
    - Missed ship dates from spreadsheet or whiteboard scheduling.
    - Bottlenecks shift daily; expediting and overtime surge.
    - Powder coat oven batching and color changes waste capacity.
