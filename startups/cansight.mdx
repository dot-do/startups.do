  title: Real-time OEE and Loss Tree for Can Lines
  description: >-
    Continuously compute OEE and pinpoint top losses by line/SKU/shift with
    automatic insights and alerts.
  targetUsers:
    - Plant Manager
    - Process Engineer
    - Line Supervisors
  triggers:
    - OPC UA/MQTT stream connected
    - Shift end summary
    - Downtime > X minutes
    - OEE drops below target
  inputs:
    - 'PLC/MES tags: run/stop, speed, counts, rejects, downtime reasons'
    - Order schedule and SKU master
    - Planned maintenance calendar
  steps:
    - 1) Securely connect to historian/OPC UA/MQTT and map tags
    - '2) Compute availability, performance, quality and OEE by shift/order'
    - 3) Build loss tree (Pareto of top downtime and scrap causes)
    - 4) Detect anomalies and trend breaks; generate root-cause hints
    - 5) Push alerts and a daily/weekly summary dashboard
  tools:
    - OPC UA/MQTT (Kepware/Ignition)
    - TimescaleDB/InfluxDB
    - Python/Pandas
    - Grafana/Metabase
    - MS Teams/Slack webhooks
  outputs:
    - Live OEE dashboard
    - Loss Pareto and trend charts
    - Auto-alerts with suggested checks
    - CSV/JSON exports to MES/BI
  pricingModel:
    - One-time setup per line
    - Monthly subscription per line/site
    - Optional SLA for 24/7 monitoring
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 8.5
    modelCapability: 9
    overall: 8.7
  risks:
    - OT network access and security approvals
    - Inaccurate/unused downtime reason codes
    - Operator trust and adoption
  dependencies:
    - VPN/DMZ access to historian/OPC UA
    - Tag list and units
    - Downtime reason code dictionary
    - Read-only credentials
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Plants lack a trustworthy, real-time OEE by line/SKU/shift; most rely on
      historian trends and spreadsheets with 12–72 hour latency.
    - >-
      30–60% of downtime is recorded as “unclassified/other,” obscuring true top
      losses and delaying countermeasures.
    - >-
      Microstops (<60 seconds) and speed losses are rarely captured; performance
      losses are systematically undercounted.
    - >-
      Changeovers/SKU mix complicate performance baselines, so alerts are either
      noisy (threshold-based) or blind to context.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs, SCADA, historians (PI/Canary), quality
      systems, and maintenance CMMS; no unified loss tree.
    - >-
      A 1 point OEE improvement on a typical two-piece can body line equals
      15–30k cans/day/line; at $0.01–$0.03 contribution margin/can, this is
      $55k–$330k/year/line. Plants leave 3–7 OEE points on the table.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turnkey OEE engine: real-time Availability/Performance/Quality, normalized
      by SKU/standard rate and shift calendars.
    - >-
      Automated Loss Tree: classifies downtime, speed loss, microstops, and
      scrap into a metal-can-specific taxonomy (body maker, decorator, necker,
      seamer for 3-piece, ends press/liner, bake ovens, inspection).
    - >-
      AI insights: root-cause candidates ranked by contribution and confidence;
      changeover analytics; Pareto of losses by line/SKU/shift/asset.
    - >-
      Smart alerts: suppresses noise; triggers only on material deviations
      (e.g., sustained speed loss, rising seam/defect rate, frequent microstops
      from same PLC tag).
    - >-
      Operator-first workflows: digital andon, guided reason codes, rapid notes
      with photo upload; bilingual UI; offline-tolerant edge.
    - >-
      Integrations: native connectors for Rockwell/Siemens PLCs, OSIsoft
      PI/AVEVA, Canary, Kepware/OPC UA, CMMS (Maximo/eMaint/Fiix), MES,
      QMS/vision systems.
    - >-
      Benchmarking: cross-line/cross-plant benchmarks normalized by can size,
      alloy, decorator colors, CUP/necking stages.
    - >-
      Security/scale: on-prem or hybrid edge+cloud; SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML,
      Azure/AWS; role-based access and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pinpoint and prevent the top losses on metal can lines in real time.
    CanSight AI fuses PLC/SCADA/historian/quality data, computes OEE by
    line/SKU/shift, classifies losses with a can-specific taxonomy, and pushes
    actionable, low-noise insights and alerts that recover 3–7 OEE points within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, metal-can-specific loss taxonomy and labeled dataset powering
    high-accuracy classification of downtime, microstops, and speed loss, plus
    prebuilt connectors/tag maps for common OEM equipment—enabling sub-6-week
    deployments and <10% unclassified downtime within 60 days, which
    general-purpose OEE tools rarely achieve.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, CI, and plant leaders at metal can manufacturers (NAICS 332431)
    who need every can line hitting speed, quality, and uptime targets.
  problem: >-
    Lagging reports and spreadsheets hide true downtime; micro-stops,
    changeovers, and quality holds silently drain OEE by line/SKU/shift—and
    issues surface after the shift, not in time to fix.
  guide: >-
    A can-line–specific AI OEE and Loss Tree service that continuously computes
    OEE and pinpoints top losses with automatic insights and alerts—built by
    manufacturing data experts.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PLC/MES/SCADA and standards; 2) Configure lines/SKUs, loss model,
    and alerts; 3) Go live with real-time OEE, top-losses, and tier boards—pilot
    in 30 days, scale plant-wide in 60.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 30-day pilot on one line.
  success: >-
    Every shift sees real-time OEE and the top 3 losses, acts immediately, cuts
    downtime and changeover waste, improves OEE by several points, hits OTIF,
    and protects margin.
  failure: >-
    Without it, plants keep flying blind—recurring stoppages, missed shipments,
    rising overtime and scrap, and pressure for costly capex to chase capacity.

    ctaHref: '#demo'
  problem:
    - OEE buried in spreadsheets; data is stale by the time you review.
    - Inconsistent downtime reasons; no single source of truth.
    - Micro-stops and speed losses stay hidden; changeovers overrun.
    - 'Quality rejects (seam, decorator, leak) scattered across systems.'
    - Missed targets by shift or SKU aren’t flagged in time.
    - Too many dashboards; not enough actionable alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on OEE with automated loss tree (availability, performance,
      quality).
    - 'Top losses ranked by line, machine, SKU, shift, and time of day.'
    - Real-time anomaly and target alerts via email/SMS/Teams.
    - AI insights that explain drivers and quantify impact in cans/hour.
    - 'Guided operator input on tablets for clean, consistent reason codes.'
    - Closed-loop actions to CMMS/MES with verification of fixes.
  features:
    - >-
      Plug-and-play connectors for PLCs, SCADA, and historians (Rockwell,
      Siemens, Ignition).
    - >-
      Prebuilt models for body makers, neckers, decorators, ovens, seamers,
      testers, palletizers, and ends lines.
    - >-
      SKU-aware standards: cycle time baselines and automatic rate-loss
      detection.
    - Changeover tracking with standard vs. actual variance and recipe context.
    - Micro-stop detection down to seconds; starvation/blockage logic.
    - >-
      Quality integration: seam checks, leak testers, vision/X-ray rejects, and
      scrap.
    - 'Live Pareto, waterfall, and Gantt for downtime and speed loss.'
    - Shift and crew comparisons with normalization for planned downtime.
    - What-if analysis to prioritize recoverable OEE and throughput impact.
    - Edge + cloud architecture with offline buffering and enterprise security.
    - 'Role-based dashboards for operators, supervisors, and engineers.'
    - 'Open APIs to MES/ERP/CMMS (SAP, Oracle, Infor, Maximo, Fiix).'
    - Multi-plant benchmarking with roll-ups and drill-downs.
    - 'Fast deployment: days to first line, weeks to scale.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect: edge gateway reads tags from PLC/SCADA/historian and sensors.'
    - 'Model: define lines, assets, SKUs, shifts, and planned downtime.'
    - 'Calibrate: import standards and reason codes; baseline cycle times.'
    - >-
      Go live: compute OEE and the loss tree in real time; validate with
      operators.
    - 'Alert: set thresholds; route notifications; auto-create work orders.'
    - 'Improve: review insights, run experiments, and track verified gains.'
    - 'Scale: replicate templates across lines and plants.'
