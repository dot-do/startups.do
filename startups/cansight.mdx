  problem:
    - >-
      Plants lack a trustworthy, real-time OEE by line/SKU/shift; most rely on
      historian trends and spreadsheets with 12–72 hour latency.
    - >-
      30–60% of downtime is recorded as “unclassified/other,” obscuring true top
      losses and delaying countermeasures.
    - >-
      Microstops (<60 seconds) and speed losses are rarely captured; performance
      losses are systematically undercounted.
    - >-
      Changeovers/SKU mix complicate performance baselines, so alerts are either
      noisy (threshold-based) or blind to context.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs, SCADA, historians (PI/Canary), quality
      systems, and maintenance CMMS; no unified loss tree.
    - >-
      A 1 point OEE improvement on a typical two-piece can body line equals
      15–30k cans/day/line; at $0.01–$0.03 contribution margin/can, this is
      $55k–$330k/year/line. Plants leave 3–7 OEE points on the table.
  solution:
    - >-
      Turnkey OEE engine: real-time Availability/Performance/Quality, normalized
      by SKU/standard rate and shift calendars.
    - >-
      Automated Loss Tree: classifies downtime, speed loss, microstops, and
      scrap into a metal-can-specific taxonomy (body maker, decorator, necker,
      seamer for 3-piece, ends press/liner, bake ovens, inspection).
    - >-
      AI insights: root-cause candidates ranked by contribution and confidence;
      changeover analytics; Pareto of losses by line/SKU/shift/asset.
    - >-
      Smart alerts: suppresses noise; triggers only on material deviations
      (e.g., sustained speed loss, rising seam/defect rate, frequent microstops
      from same PLC tag).
    - >-
      Operator-first workflows: digital andon, guided reason codes, rapid notes
      with photo upload; bilingual UI; offline-tolerant edge.
    - >-
      Integrations: native connectors for Rockwell/Siemens PLCs, OSIsoft
      PI/AVEVA, Canary, Kepware/OPC UA, CMMS (Maximo/eMaint/Fiix), MES,
      QMS/vision systems.
    - >-
      Benchmarking: cross-line/cross-plant benchmarks normalized by can size,
      alloy, decorator colors, CUP/necking stages.
    - >-
      Security/scale: on-prem or hybrid edge+cloud; SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML,
      Azure/AWS; role-based access and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Pinpoint and prevent the top losses on metal can lines in real time.
    CanSight AI fuses PLC/SCADA/historian/quality data, computes OEE by
    line/SKU/shift, classifies losses with a can-specific taxonomy, and pushes
    actionable, low-noise insights and alerts that recover 3–7 OEE points within
    90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, metal-can-specific loss taxonomy and labeled dataset powering
    high-accuracy classification of downtime, microstops, and speed loss, plus
    prebuilt connectors/tag maps for common OEM equipment—enabling sub-6-week
    deployments and <10% unclassified downtime within 60 days, which
    general-purpose OEE tools rarely achieve.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, CI, and plant leaders at metal can manufacturers (NAICS 332431)
    who need every can line hitting speed, quality, and uptime targets.
  problem: >-
    Lagging reports and spreadsheets hide true downtime; micro-stops,
    changeovers, and quality holds silently drain OEE by line/SKU/shift—and
    issues surface after the shift, not in time to fix.
  guide: >-
    A can-line–specific AI OEE and Loss Tree service that continuously computes
    OEE and pinpoints top losses with automatic insights and alerts—built by
    manufacturing data experts.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PLC/MES/SCADA and standards; 2) Configure lines/SKUs, loss model,
    and alerts; 3) Go live with real-time OEE, top-losses, and tier boards—pilot
    in 30 days, scale plant-wide in 60.
  callToAction: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 30-day pilot on one line.
  success: >-
    Every shift sees real-time OEE and the top 3 losses, acts immediately, cuts
    downtime and changeover waste, improves OEE by several points, hits OTIF,
    and protects margin.
  failure: >-
    Without it, plants keep flying blind—recurring stoppages, missed shipments,
    rising overtime and scrap, and pressure for costly capex to chase capacity.
