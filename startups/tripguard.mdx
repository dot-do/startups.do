leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High rate of card-not-present fraud and friendly fraud in rides resulting
      in 0.2–0.8% of GMV lost to chargebacks for mid-market operators
    - >-
      Manual review and dispute creation is slow and inconsistent; win rates
      often below 25% due to weak evidence packaging
    - >-
      Promo/referral abuse inflates CAC by 10–30% for growth-stage operators via
      fake accounts and rings
    - >-
      Limited visibility into collusive fraud (driver–rider collusion, GPS
      spoofing, route manipulation) and synthetic identities
    - >-
      Generic e-commerce fraud tools lack mobility-specific telemetry (GPS
      traces, route adherence, device motion) and therefore over/under-block
    - >-
      Engineering teams are overloaded; integrating risk and building CE
      3.0-compliant evidence kits in-house takes 6–12 months
    - >-
      Regulatory, data-privacy, and card network evidence standards are
      evolving; hard for smaller fleets to keep up
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time trip risk scoring API and SDK (sub-50 ms p95 latency) combining
      device fingerprinting, geospatial anomaly detection, route adherence,
      velocity checks, identity risk, and payment signals
    - >-
      Promo/referral abuse detection (multi-accounting graphs, emulator/VM
      detection, referral ring detection, device/phone/email/IMEI clustering,
      voucher velocity/stacking controls)
    - >-
      Synthetic identity and account integrity modeling (graph ML, phone/email
      risk, SIM swap signals, disposable domains, KYC enrichment hooks)
    - >-
      Chargeback Defense Studio: auto-compile compelling evidence with trip
      logs, GPS trace maps, driver telemetry, device fingerprints, chat logs,
      support contacts; exports formatted for Visa CE 3.0, Mastercard, Amex
    - >-
      Policy engine to auto-block, step-up authenticate, or hold for review;
      supports 3DS trigger rules and SCA exemptions where applicable
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review console with playbooks and reason codes; active
      learning feeds back reviewer outcomes to models
    - >-
      Integrations: dispatch platforms (iCabbi, Autocab, Curb), PSPs (Stripe,
      Adyen, Braintree, Worldpay), mapping (Google, Mapbox, HERE), data
      providers (Ekata, Telesign, SEON)
    - >-
      Dashboards and alerts: fraud loss rate, chargeback rate by
      BIN/issuer/region, promo leakage, top collusion clusters, model drift
    - >-
      Privacy and compliance: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR/CCPA controls, data retention
      policies, PII tokenization, regional data residency options
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce fraud losses and chargebacks by 30–50% and improve dispute win rates
    to 45–65% with mobility-native AI that scores trips in <50 ms and
    auto-builds CE 3.0-compliant dispute packages using GPS, telematics, and
    platform logs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Mobility-native evidence and telemetry (GPS traces, route adherence, driver
    motion) packaged into CE 3.0-ready disputes, plus a cross-operator fraud
    graph that detects collusion and rings not visible to generic e-commerce
    tools; deep integrations with dispatch platforms reduce time-to-value to
    weeks instead of quarters.
