leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators and PMs spend 6–12 hours per project manually parsing Division
      08 specs, door schedules, and addenda across messy PDFs.
    - >-
      Manual extraction errors (missing closers, wrong handing, fire-rating
      mismatches) cause change orders and backcharges; typical rework costs
      $500–$3,000 per project.
    - >-
      Version control is fragile. Addenda and bulletins overwrite previous
      hardware sets, and teams lose track of what changed and why.
    - >-
      No standard taxonomy. Architects/spec writers vary terms (eg, lockset vs
      cylindrical lock vs mortise set), making normalization and vendor SKU
      mapping error-prone.
    - >-
      Duplicate data entry across estimating spreadsheets, RFQs to distributors,
      and PO systems wastes time and introduces risk.
    - >-
      Lack of auditability. Teams can’t easily justify counts, decisions, or
      produce an RFI list tied to spec clauses and sheet references.
    - >-
      Existing general-purpose OCR/AI tools and takeoff apps aren’t optimized
      for hardware sets-to-openings mapping or RFQ/PO-ready exports.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload spec book (PDF), plan sheets, door schedule (PDF/CSV), and
      addenda/bulletins.
    - >-
      AI classifies and parses Division 08 sections; extracts door schedule,
      hardware sets, and notes; cross-references to openings.
    - >-
      Normalizes terminology to a controlled hardware taxonomy; auto-detects
      fire rating, ADA, egress, and code-critical dependencies.
    - >-
      Maps hardware sets to openings; deduplicates by set; computes counts by
      item and finish; flags conflicts (eg, closer specified but not compatible
      with door weight).
    - >-
      Exports: hardware set matrix (Excel), RFQ package (Excel/PDF), PO-ready
      CSV with provisional SKUs by brand, and an RFI list tied to sheet/spec
      references.
    - >-
      Tracks addenda deltas; shows exactly what changed between versions;
      updates counts and flags impacted openings.
    - >-
      Integrations to Procore/Autodesk Build (Docs), Bluebeam, PlanSwift, and
      accounting/PO systems (CSV/QuickBooks/Xero).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy Division 08 specs and door schedules into accurate hardware set
    matrices and RFQ/PO-ready exports in minutes—not days—reducing bid time by
    50–80% and change-order risk by 30%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized Division 08 dataset and normalization taxonomy with brand/SKU
    crosswalks, plus addenda-aware diffing that ties every output back to source
    clauses and sheet callouts—creating auditable, RFQ/PO-ready deliverables
    competitors can’t easily replicate.
