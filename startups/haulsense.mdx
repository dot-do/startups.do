  problem:
    - >-
      Mass haul plans are built with manual rules of thumb, static mass
      diagrams, or generic software defaults, leading to 10–25% avoidable truck
      hours on typical site prep projects.
    - >-
      Frequent design updates (RFI/ASIs), discovered unsuitable materials, and
      weather-driven access changes force rework; recalculating optimal haul
      directions and stockpiles takes hours to days, causing idle equipment and
      cost overruns.
    - >-
      Swell/shrink, material segregation, and restricted haul routes create
      complex constraints rarely modeled accurately, resulting in excess
      rehandling and non-compliance with specs.
    - >-
      Estimators and supers struggle to translate bid-time balance assumptions
      into executable daily haul plans; lack of feedback loops from
      telematics/drones makes learning and improvement slow.
    - >-
      Construction schedules and haul plans are disconnected; impacts on
      duration, fuel, and CO2 are not quantified, limiting owner-facing value
      engineering and ESG reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload existing/proposed surfaces (TIN/LAS/LandXML), haul roads,
      constraints, and fleet/production cost tables; the AI solver produces
      lowest-cost haul flows with phase-specific stockpiles and time-sequenced
      execution.
    - >-
      Scenario engine to compare alternatives (e.g., different haul road
      alignments, fleet mixes, borrow/waste options, weather constraints) with
      cost, duration, fuel, and CO2 impacts.
    - >-
      Daily re-optimization using drone updates or telematics progress to adjust
      routes, stockpiles, and targets, minimizing rehandling and queueing.
    - >-
      Bid-to-build continuity: convert estimate mass balance to a day-by-day
      haul plan with cycle counts, shift plans, and truck/excavator pairing.
    - >-
      One-click exports: Civil 3D/InfraWorks surfaces and mass haul diagrams;
      Trimble/Topcon/Leica machine control linework; Gantt tasks to P6/MS
      Project; CSV to HCSS/B2W.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut trucking hours by 10–25% with AI-optimized cut/fill balance, haul
    directions, and stockpiles generated in under 30 minutes—continuously
    re-optimized as conditions change and integrated with your existing takeoff,
    machine control, telematics, and schedule tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop dataset combining bid assumptions, AI-optimized plans, and
    verified field telemetry/drone progress to continuously learn true
    production rates and congestion effects—improving with every job and
    difficult for incumbents to replicate quickly. Backed by civil domain
    experts and ROI-guaranteed pilots that convert into sticky workflows and
    integrations.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Site-preparation contractors, earthwork PMs, and estimators who must deliver
    balanced sites on time and on budget.
  problem: >-
    Irregular topo and changing designs force guesswork. Manual mass-haul
    planning leads to rehandling, long haul cycles, idle trucks, and blown
    fuel/fleet budgets—putting bids, schedules, and margins at risk.
  guide: >-
    We’re earthwork-savvy AI specialists. We understand the cost of every
    unnecessary truck minute. Our optimizer plugs into your CAD/DTM workflow and
    produces actionable haul directions, stockpile placements, and balance
    strategies validated on real projects.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload existing/proposed surfaces, haul roads/constraints, unit rates,
    and stockpile options. 2) AI optimizes cut/fill balance, haul directions,
    and temporary stockpiles to minimize total trucking time/cost. 3) Export a
    detailed mass-haul plan, cycle counts, and staging map; monitor field
    progress and reoptimize as conditions change.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a no-obligation pilot on your next bid. Secondary: Book a
    20-minute demo and ROI estimate using your project volumes.
  success: >-
    Fewer truck hours and rehandles, minimal total haul, predictable schedules
    and fuel, clear staging for crews, stronger bids, and higher margins—with
    traceable savings per phase.
  failure: >-
    Keep burning cash on long hauls and rehandling, trucks waiting, weekend
    catch-up shifts, change-order disputes, and projects that slip schedule and
    margin.

    subtitle: >-
      Balance earth, shorten hauls, and place stockpiles to cut trucking cost
      and days on site.

    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - Bids hinge on haul distances you can’t see in 2D.
    - Manual mass haul takes hours and misses phasing.
    - Unbalanced cut/fill drives rehandle and double-moves.
    - Trucks queue or deadhead without clear haul directions.
    - Stockpiles land in the wrong place and grow costs.
    - Late design changes blow up the earthwork plan.
    - Hard to compare import/export vs on-site balance.
    - Constraints on haul roads and access aren’t enforced.
  solution:
    - Optimize cut/fill balance by phase to minimize haul cost/time.
    - Compute shortest feasible hauls with route rules and constraints.
    - Auto-place and size temporary stockpiles to avoid rehandle.
    - 'Generate mass haul diagrams, haul directions, and assignments.'
