  problem:
    - >-
      Design cycles for distribution and specialty transformers are slow (2–10
      days) and rely heavily on scarce senior expertise, delaying quotes and
      reducing win rates.
    - >-
      Current tools are fragmented (spreadsheets, legacy scripts, generic FEA),
      leading to inconsistent assumptions, calculation errors, and rework during
      factory acceptance tests (FAT).
    - >-
      Rapid material price volatility (copper/CRGO/amorphous) makes accurate,
      up-to-date costed designs difficult during pre-bid, causing margin leakage
      or uncompetitive pricing.
    - >-
      Meeting efficiency and loss targets (DOE, EU EcoDesign, CSA), dielectric
      clearances, and temperature rise requirements (IEEE/IEC) is complex and
      error-prone without a rule engine.
    - >-
      Design-to-manufacture handoff lacks standardization; datasheets are
      non-uniform and often missing key parameters, causing clarifications,
      change orders, and delays.
    - >-
      New engineer onboarding is lengthy (6–12 months to autonomy) due to
      implicit tribal knowledge encoded in spreadsheets and senior reviews.
    - >-
      Limited ability to explore trade-offs (cost vs losses vs weight vs
      footprint) quickly across core, winding, and cooling configurations
      reduces optimization quality.
    - >-
      Quoting teams lack fast, defensible sensitivity analyses (commodity price
      changes, tap range, impedance) to make informed bid decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Physics-informed AI engine that proposes core form/shell, CRGO vs
      amorphous, winding type (disc/helix/foil/CTC), and cooling class
      (ONAN/ONAF/ODAF; AN/AF for dry-type) based on specs (kVA/MVA, voltages,
      impedance, temperature rise, regulation).
    - >-
      Rule engine encoding IEEE C57 and IEC 60076 requirements for clearances,
      temperature rise, dielectric tests, and short-circuit withstand checks,
      with region-specific efficiency standards (DOE, EU EcoDesign, CSA).
    - >-
      Optimization module for multi-objective trade-offs (CAPEX, losses, weight,
      footprint, noise) with Pareto front visualization and sensitivity to
      commodity price inputs (LME copper, electrical steel indices).
    - >-
      Auto-generated, customer-ready design datasheet and outline
      (PDF/Word/Excel) including losses, dimensions, weights, impedances,
      thermal class, tap-changer details, clearances; plus costed BOM summary.
    - >-
      Materials database with grades (M2–M5 CRGO, amorphous Metglas), B–H
      curves, stacking factors, fill factors, loss curves, thermal properties;
      versioned and supplier-linked.
    - >-
      API and connectors to ERP/PLM (SAP, Oracle, Teamcenter, Windchill) to push
      BOM and receive cost/availability; export to CAD/FEA templates for
      detailed mechanical/electromagnetic refinement.
    - >-
      Validation loop using factory test results (no-load/load loss, impedance,
      temperature rise) to continuously calibrate models and provide accuracy
      dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce transformer design-and-quote time from days to hours while meeting
    IEEE/IEC efficiency, thermal, dielectric, and mechanical requirements. PTDA
    suggests optimal core/winding/thermal configurations, auto-generates a
    standards-aligned datasheet and costed BOM, and provides explainable,
    auditable calculations integrated with your ERP/PLM.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, physics-informed AI calibrated on validated factory test
    results across multiple manufacturers, combined with a standards rule engine
    and live materials/cost feeds. Enterprise-ready, explainable designs with
    audit trails and on-prem options address IP/security barriers that generic
    FEA or spreadsheets cannot.

  character: >-
    Design, quotation, and product teams at power, distribution, and specialty
    transformer manufacturers who need optimized, manufacturable,
    standards-compliant designs fast.
  problem: >-
    external: Specs and grid codes vary; material prices shift;
    losses/heat-rise/noise targets must be met under tight RFQs; tools are
    fragmented.

    internal: Pressure to respond quickly with confidence; fear of hidden
    hot-spots, cost creep, and rework; spreadsheet fatigue.

    philosophical: Engineering time should go to innovation, not repetitive
    calculations and manual lookups.
  guide: >-
    empathy: We’ve lived the RFQ grind—core factors, window fill, stray losses,
    and thermal margins are unforgiving under deadlines.

    authority: Built by veteran transformer engineers, aligned with IEEE/IEC
    methods, validated on thousands of designs, and tuned for factory
    constraints.
  plan: >-
    process: 1) Input ratings/specs, standards, constraints, and materials. 2)
    Explore parametric core/winding/thermal configurations with multi-objective
    optimization. 3) Review trade-offs, select a design. 4) Export a design
    datasheet (distribution/specialty), winding schedule, loss/thermal summary,
    and manufacturability checks.

    agreement: Private, secure workspace; data remains isolated; traceable calc
    steps; human approval required before release.
  callToAction: |-
    direct: Book a 30-minute demo and pilot on two live RFQs.
    transitional: Download a sample datasheet and benchmark against a past job.
  success: >-
    Faster quote-to-proposal; higher win rates; reduced copper/steel while
    meeting loss and heat-rise targets; predictable compliance (IEEE/IEC);
    consistent datasheets; shorter onboarding; captured tribal knowledge.
  failure: >-
    Slow quotes and missed bids; over/under-design leading to cost overrun,
    hot-spots, noise issues, and test failures; rework and schedule slips;
