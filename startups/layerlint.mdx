  title: CAD Standards Cleanup & Layer Normalization
  description: >-
    Automated linting and normalization of DWGs to client standards: layers,
    styles, units, blocks, xrefs, and plotting.
  targetUsers:
    - Firms consolidating legacy CAD
    - Offshore/outsourced drafting QC
    - Owners standardizing deliverables
  triggers:
    - Drop folder watch
    - Portal upload with selected standard
    - API job submit with config
  inputs:
    - DWG set with xrefs
    - 'Target standard package (DWT, CTB/STB, layer/linetype map CSV)'
    - Approved block replacement map
    - Units and tolerance policy
  steps:
    - 'Audit layers, styles, units, and xrefs'
    - Apply layer renames/merges and linetype mappings
    - Replace non-compliant blocks and styles
    - Fix units/scales; rescale dimensions if needed
    - Purge/regenerate; repair xrefs and paths
    - Generate QA report; auto-fix safe issues; flag edge cases
  tools:
    - AutoCAD .NET/JavaScript API
    - ODA Drawings SDK
    - Autodesk Platform Services – Design Automation
    - Custom CAD linter
  outputs:
    - Standardized DWGs with audit trail
    - QA report (issues fixed/flagged)
    - Updated CTB/STB or plot configs
  pricingModel:
    - Per drawing/sheet
    - Bulk project pricing
    - Subscription for continuous QA

  risks:
    - Over-aggressive cleanup removing intentional data
    - Incorrect block replacements
    - Hidden xref dependencies
  dependencies:
    - Client-approved mapping tables
    - Software licensing/APS credits
    - Test sample for validation
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent DWG standards from multiple subs and legacy projects cause
      1–3 hours of manual cleanup per file (layers, text/dim styles, blocks,
      xrefs, plot styles).
    - >-
      Built‑in tools (Layer Translator, CAD Standards Checker) and legacy LISP
      scripts are brittle, incomplete, and require expert babysitting; they
      don’t scale across projects or firms.
    - >-
      Failed submittals and rework due to standards non‑compliance create
      schedule risk and cost overruns; CAD managers lack a measurable compliance
      score and audit trail.
    - >-
      Distributed teams and outsourced drafting produce standards drift; firms
      lack a reliable, automated way to enforce client or internal standards
      before issue.
    - >-
      Security and IP concerns limit sending files to ad‑hoc freelancers; firms
      need compliant, auditable, and optionally on‑prem cleanup with clear
      ownership and logs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest: Secure upload/API, watch‑folder, or AutoCAD plug‑in; parse DWG/DXF
      and dependencies (xrefs, fonts, plot styles).
    - >-
      Detect: AI + rules identify current layers/styles/blocks/units/linetypes;
      infer likely standards; highlight conflicts and duplicates.
    - >-
      Map: Auto‑map to target standard (by template/DWS/NCS, client spec) with
      confidence scores; propose merges; scale units; fix styles and linetypes.
    - >-
      Normalize: Replace/rename layers, swap/dedupe blocks, re‑path xrefs,
      standardize plot styles (CTB/STB), layouts, and title block attributes.
    - >-
      Validate: Generate a compliance score and before/after diff; flag
      ambiguous items for human review; re‑run until score threshold is met.
    - >-
      Deliver: Export cleaned DWG set, PDF plots, and a machine‑readable audit
      (JSON/CSV) plus a compliance report for submittals; push to Autodesk
      Docs/SharePoint/Procore.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn messy DWGs into standard‑compliant deliverables in minutes with a
    measurable compliance score, human‑in‑the‑loop overrides, and an auditable
    diff—cutting cleanup time by 60–85% and reducing submittal rejections.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary mapping knowledge graph trained on real‑world DWGs
    across disciplines and clients, delivering higher automation rates than
    rule‑only tools; tight AutoCAD plug‑in + CDE integrations enabling CI‑style
    gating; and an auditable compliance score/diff that satisfies submittal and
    QA requirements. Early SOC 2 and on‑prem agent unlock security‑sensitive
    accounts.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    CAD/BIM managers and drafting teams who need every DWG to match client and
    client-company standards without manual, error-prone cleanup.
  problem: >-
    External: Inherited/vendor DWGs arrive with inconsistent layers, styles,
    units, blocks, xrefs, and plotting setups. Internal: Teams burn billable
    hours fixing files, miss deadlines, and lose confidence. Philosophical:
    Precision talent shouldn’t waste time on repetitive cleanup—it should focus
    on design and delivery.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of mismatched standards under deadline pressure.
    Built by former CAD leads, our AI lint-and-normalize engine for
    AutoCAD-based workflows enforces layers, styles, units, blocks, xrefs, and
    plot settings with predictable, auditable results.
  plan: >-
    1) Load standards: DWT/DWS, CTB/STB, layer map, naming rules, units. 2)
    Upload DWGs or connect a folder. 3) AI lints and normalizes; produces a diff
    report. 4) Approve batch fix; receive cleaned DWGs plus backups. Optional:
    schedule ongoing checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 15‑minute demo or upload a sample DWG for a free cleanup.
    Transitional: Download the layer‑mapping template and sample diff report.
  success: >-
    Every DWG ships standards‑compliant and ready to plot; fewer RFIs and
    rework; faster submittals; smooth vendor onboarding; clean xrefs/blocks;
    predictable deliverables that protect margins and reputation.
  failure: >-
    Without it: misplotted sheets, inconsistent layers, broken xrefs, unit
    errors, costly rework, QA flags, slipped deadlines, and dissatisfied
    clients.

    title: CAD Standards Cleanup & Layer Normalization
    subtitle: >-
      Automated linting and normalization of DWGs to client standards—layers,
      styles, units, blocks, xrefs, and plotting.
    ctaText: Run a Free Audit
    ctaHref: '#start'
  problem:
    - 'Drafts arrive with mixed layers, wrong linetypes, and color chaos.'
    - Styles and fonts drift; dimensions look different from sheet to sheet.
    - Units mismatch (metric/imperial) causing scale errors and rework.
    - 'Blocks are duplicated, exploded, or misnamed; attributes don’t match.'
    - 'Xrefs break, paths are absolute, and sheets won’t resolve on open.'
    - Plot setups and CTB/STB don’t match client deliverables.
    - Manual cleanup burns hours and introduces risk on every deadline.
  solution:
    - Lints each DWG against your client standards pack or DWT.
    - >-
      Auto-maps and merges layers to the correct names, colors, linetypes, and
      weights.
    - 'Harmonizes text, dim, and leader styles across the file.'
    - 'Detects units, fixes insertion scales, and rescales geometry safely.'
    - >-
      Standardizes and deduplicates blocks; aligns attributes to required
      schemas.
    - >-
      Repairs xrefs, converts paths, binds/attaches per policy, and restores
      layer states.
    - Applies the right page setups and CTB/STB; verifies plot readiness.
    - Produces a change log and pass/fail report for QA and submittals.
  features:
    - 'Client Standards Packs: per-client rules, templates, CTB/STB, layer maps.'
    - 'AI Layer Mapper: learns naming variants and merges without losing intent.'
    - 'Style Harmonizer: text/dim/ML styles normalized and locked.'
    - 'Units & Scale Guard: automatic unit detection and safe rescale.'
    - 'Block Governor: dedupe, replace exploded, enforce attribute sets.'
    - 'Xref Doctor: fix paths, recover, purge, or bind per policy.'
    - 'Plot Packager: ready-to-plot sheets, page setups, title blocks verified.'
    - 'Batch + API: process folders or integrate with your project pipeline.'
    - 'QA Reports: diff, audit trail, and stamp for deliverable records.'
    - >-
      Safe by default: backups, versioning, encrypted processing, and on‑prem
      option.
  steps:
    - Upload DWGs or connect a project folder.
    - Choose a client standards pack (or import DWT/DWS/CTB/STB).
    - 'Click Clean to lint, normalize, and stage fixes.'
    - Review the change log; accept all or tweak mappings.
    - 'Download cleaned DWGs and plot-ready sheets, or push via integration.'
    - Enable auto-runs for new files and batch jobs.
