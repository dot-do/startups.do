  problem:
    - >-
      High-quality logo design is slow (1–6 weeks) and expensive
      ($1,000–$10,000) with agencies, while gig platforms are inconsistent.
    - >-
      Most AI logo tools output generic raster images; few deliver clean,
      editable vectors (SVG/AI/EPS) and real-world usage mockups.
    - >-
      Iteration with feedback is painful and slow; clients want to say “more of
      this, less of that” and see precise changes instantly.
    - >-
      SMBs and startups need production-ready deliverables: typography choices,
      color systems, responsive lockups, and brand guideline basics.
    - >-
      Originality and trademark risks are rarely checked, leading to potential
      legal issues and rework.
    - >-
      Designers and small studios need a fast way to explore many directions and
      present polished options without burning hours on ideation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided creative brief (industry, values, style, constraints) that
      generates 12–24 diverse logo directions in minutes.
    - >-
      Interactive feedback loop: approve/reject elements, adjust style sliders,
      and request targeted edits (“simplify icon, increase contrast, try
      geometric sans”).
    - >-
      Vector-first pipeline: outputs clean, editable SVG/AI/EPS with sensible
      path counts, grid alignment, and responsive lockups.
    - >-
      Automated typography pairing and color systems (primary/secondary/mono),
      with accessibility contrast checks (WCAG AA).
    - >-
      Realistic usage mockups (website header, app icon, packaging, signage,
      social profile, business card) to validate in context.
    - >-
      Basic brand guidelines (PDF): logo usage, clear space, color codes, type
      styles, and dos/don’ts.
    - >-
      Originality: visual similarity search against public marks; trademark name
      pre-screen (USPTO/EUIPO) with risk flags (not legal advice).
    - >-
      Collaboration: shareable review links, comments, approval workflows, and
      versioning.
    - >-
      Integrations: Figma/Illustrator plugin, Shopify/Wix/WordPress apps, export
      presets for printers and merch.
    - >-
      Optional human designer QA add-on for final polish, and animated logo
      export for digital use.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Production-ready logos in hours, not weeks: multi-direction AI ideation +
    feedback-driven refinement that outputs clean vectors, brand kit assets, and
    real-world mockups—with originality and trademark pre-screening.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    (not just static images), enabling precise, editable, and original
    logos—plus deep workflow integrations and automated risk checks competitors
    lack.
