  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and advisers spend 6–12 hours per field cleaning yield data and
      drawing zones; results vary widely year-to-year, undermining trust and
      adoption.
    - >-
      Single-year imagery/yield maps produce unstable zones that swing with
      weather, leading to poor ROI on variable-rate (VR) seeding and fertility.
    - >-
      Cotton-specific agronomic constraints (water-limited environments, variety
      response, sand blowouts, salinity) are not captured by generic zoning
      tools.
    - >-
      Data lives in silos (John Deere Ops Center, Climate FieldView, CNH, Ag
      Leader) and isn’t easily converted into machine-ready Rx across brands.
    - >-
      Consultants struggle to consistently prove ROI; few systems make it easy
      to run side-by-side/strip trials at scale and quantify lift.
    - >-
      Creating and loading prescriptions is error-prone (rate caps, implement
      constraints), causing execution failures at planting or fertilizing.
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-year data fusion (3–7 years of yield, satellite, soil EC/texture,
      elevation, crop/rotation) to compute stable, agronomically interpretable
      zones.
    - >-
      Automated data cleaning (outlier detection, header/lag correction, unit
      normalization) that turns raw monitor data into analytics-grade layers.
    - >-
      Cotton-specific VR engines for seeding and fertility that respect
      implement constraints (min/max rates, section control, planter meters) and
      variety responses.
    - >-
      Machine-ready exports (ISOXML, Shapefile, Deere/Ops Center, CNH AFS, Ag
      Leader, Trimble) with field-level validation to prevent load failures.
    - >-
      In-app trial designer to place replicated strips/small plots for VR vs
      flat-rate comparisons; season-end analytics with quantified ROI.
    - >-
      Partner/white-label portal for consultants and retailers with role-based
      access, audit trails, and bulk processing across client acres.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Cotton farm managers and agronomists who want to turn multi-year field data
    into stable management zones and variable-rate seeding and fertility plans
    that raise ROI and reduce risk.
  problem: >-
    Soil variability, weather swings, and siloed datasets make uniform rates
    wasteful and VR hardware underused; guesswork leads to over or under
    seeding, nutrient inefficiency, and lost profit.
  guide: >-
    We are cotton-focused agronomists and ML engineers. Our AI fuses multi-year
    yield, soil EC and texture, imagery, and as-applied layers to build stable
    zones and agronomically sound prescriptions, compatible with common
    controllers and file formats.
  plan: >-
    1) Import multi-year data (yield, soil, imagery, as-applied). 2) We build
    stable management zones. 3) Review zones and set goals by field. 4) Generate
    variable-rate seeding and fertility prescriptions. 5) Export files (ISOXML,
    shapefile) or push via API. 6) Measure results and refine annually.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute field assessment or upload sample data to see your
    first zones and prescriptions.
  success: >-
    Confident, repeatable zones; higher input-use efficiency; more consistent
    cotton yields; clear, defensible rate decisions; smoother VR execution
    across equipment; better profitability and sustainability reporting.
  failure: >-
    Another season of flat-rate guesswork, wasted seed and fertilizer, nutrient
    loss and compliance risk, underused VR equipment, and inconsistent field
    performance.
