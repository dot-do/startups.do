leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Late detection of turnaround slippage (cleaning, fueling, catering,
      baggage, crew) leads to missed D0/D15; issues often discovered <10 minutes
      before off-block when recovery options are limited.
    - >-
      Fragmented stakeholders (airport ops, airline station ops/OCC, ground
      handlers, fueling, catering) rely on siloed systems and ad-hoc chat
      groups; actions are uncoordinated and duplicative.
    - >-
      Existing tools forecast delays but do not prescribe concrete,
      role-specific recovery actions or close the loop on execution and impact.
    - >-
      Data quality gaps (incomplete AODB milestones, inconsistent handler
      timestamps, missing GSE telematics/vision signals) reduce trust and
      adoption of analytics.
    - >-
      Ramp teams face alert fatigue; irrelevant notifications reduce
      responsiveness during peak waves.
    - >-
      No standardized, continuous measurement of minute-level savings per
      recovery action, making ROI hard to prove and sustain in budget cycles.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time data fusion from AODB/A-CDM (AIDX), handler systems,
      ADS-B/ACARS, optional CCTV/GSE telematics to track standard milestones
      (on-block, pax off, bags off, fueling start/end, cleaning complete,
      boarding start/end, doors closed).
    - >-
      ML models predict milestone timings and slippage risk with explainability
      (drivers like late catering truck ETA, GPU unavailability, boarding rate
      anomalies).
    - >-
      Prescriptive playbooks map risks to recovery actions with time/cost
      trade-offs (e.g., parallelize cleaning/boarding, dispatch spare belt
      loader, move to adjacent gate, push pre-boarding, adjust fueling plan).
    - >-
      Nudge router targets the right person/team on the right channel (ramp
      handheld, Teams/SITA Mission Control, SMS) with clear actions, deadlines,
      and acknowledgement requirements.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: capture acceptance, measure resulting time saved,
      and auto-update TOBT/TSAT where applicable.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement: A/B test actions, learn best local playbooks by
      fleet/stand/time-of-day/handler, and surface operational insights to
      leadership.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict milestone slippage 15–25 minutes before it cascades and orchestrate
    cross-stakeholder, role-specific recovery actions that measurably protect
    D0/D15. Typical results within 90 days: 15–25% reduction in turnaround
    variance, +3–7pt D0 at deployed gates, 3–6 minutes saved on 20–35% of
    risk-flagged turns.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, prescriptive orchestration with measured minute savings per
    action, built on a growing cross-airport dataset of what actually works by
    fleet, stand, handler, and time-of-day. Prebuilt connectors into major AODB
    and comms platforms reduce time-to-value; airport-grade security/compliance
    and proven pilot ROI accelerate procurement versus predictive-only or
    planning-only tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Airport operations leaders (apron control, turnaround coordinators, ground
    handlers) who need predictable, on-time turnarounds without firefighting.
  problem: >-
    Fragmented data and missed handoffs cause milestone slippage, delays, and
    blame; teams react late instead of orchestrating early. On-time performance
    should be predictable, not luck.
  guide: >-
    We understand airside pressure and A-CDM realities. Our AI leverages
    historical turnaround data and integrates with your AODB and handler systems
    to surface risks early and coordinate decisive action.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest milestones, resources, and stand data. 2) Predict: flag
    per-flight slippage risk in real time. 3) Orchestrate: nudge the right
    stakeholder with concrete recovery actions. 4) Learn: post-ops review to
    refine playbooks.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 60-day station pilot.
    Transitional: Get a free turnaround risk baseline and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Higher OTP and slot adherence, fewer overruns, clear accountability,
    coordinated teams, lower ground delay costs and penalties, smoother
    passenger flow, and audit-ready A-CDM compliance.
  failure: >-
    Without it, you stay in constant firefighting—avoidable delays, missed
    slots, overtime and equipment conflicts, frustrated partners, and eroding
    airline and passenger trust.

  problem:
    - >-
      Turnarounds slip for small reasons that snowball into missed slots and OTP
      penalties.

      constraints.
    - No clear link between actions taken and minutes saved.
  solution:
    - Live monitoring of every turnaround milestone from blocks-on to pushback.
    - Early prediction of slippage with confidence and impact on EOBT/TSAT/OTP.
    - 'Prescriptive, role-aware nudges with concrete recovery actions.'
