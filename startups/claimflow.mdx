leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone claim preparation leads to missed deadlines (30-day
      acknowledgment, 120-day resolution per 49 CFR Part 370) and low recovery
      rates.
    - >-
      Evidence gaps (undocumented exceptions, missing photos, invoices, BOL/DR
      mismatches) cause denials or partial payouts.
    - >-
      Fragmented carrier portals and inconsistent tariff rules increase cycle
      time (typical 45–120 days) and labor (30–60 min per claim).
    - >-
      Inconsistent valuation vs carrier limits of liability and NMFC rules
      reduces payout; many teams lack fast access to tariff-specific liability
      calculations.
    - >-
      Poor visibility: no standardized KPIs for claim cycle time, recovery rate,
      and evidence completeness across locations/carriers.
    - >-
      High internal handling cost ($25–$75 per claim) and variable expertise
      across receiving docks and claims staff.
  solution:
    - >-
      Evidence automation: ingest BOL/DR/PoD, invoices, packaging specs; dock
      app guides exception notation and photo capture at time of receipt.
    - >-
      Rules-driven triage: liability assessment per Carmack, NMFC, and carrier
      tariffs; flags concealed damage timelines and salvage requirements.
    - >-
      Valuation engine: computes claimable amount factoring invoice cost,
      freight charges where applicable, depreciation, salvage/resale, and
      carrier liability limits by class/service/tariff.
    - >-
      Filing automation: auto-generate claim forms with attachments; file via
      carrier APIs, email, or portal RPA with status sync.
    - >-
      Compliance tracking: monitors 30-day acknowledgment and 120-day resolution
      windows; escalations and reminders; documented audit trail.
    - >-
      Analytics: recovery rate by carrier/location/product, average cycle time,
      evidence completeness score, and dollars recovered per 100 shipments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered OS&D claims assistant that auto-triages losses/damages, compiles
    complete evidence from shipment systems and dock capture, calculates
    claimable value against carrier-specific limits, files through portals/APIs,
    and tracks regulatory deadlines—cutting cycle time by 40–60% and increasing
    recovery 10–20%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Combination of a continuously updated carrier/tariff rules engine,
    outcome-trained valuation and denial-risk models, and high-reliability
    portal/RPA connectors, plus dock-level evidence capture that materially
    improves claim success—difficult to replicate without multi-carrier
    integrations, historical outcomes data, and on-site adoption playbooks.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Mid-market shippers (manufacturing, industrial supplies, building
      materials, consumer durables) shipping 500–20,000 LTL shipments/year.
    - >-
      Primary: 3PLs managing LTL programs for SMB/mid-market shippers
      (outsourced transportation management).
    - >-

      shippers via targeted LinkedIn and email sequences (ICP: 500–20,000 LTL

      Partnerships with TMS providers (e.g., MercuryGate, Shipwell, Descartes)
      for marketplace/app store listings and revenue sharing.

      3PL channel: white-label for 3PLs offering managed claims; per-shipper
      rollout playbooks and co-marketing.
    - Freight audit & payment firms to bundle claim filing; referral fees.
    - >-
      Content-led growth: OS&D playbooks, NMFC/tariff primers, claims ROI
      calculator; SEO targeting “LTL freight claim process,” “concealed damage
      claim,” “carrier liability limits.”

      Industry events and associations: CSCMP, NASSTRAC, SMC3, FreightWaves
      events; webinars with logistics councils/regional chambers focusing on
      evidence capture best practices.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations, claims, and customer service leaders at long‑distance LTL
    shippers, 3PLs, and distributors who need fast, accurate OS&D recovery
    without drowning in paperwork.
  problem: >-
    External: Freight arrives over/short/damaged; claims demand perfect
    documentation, valuation, and carrier‑specific rules under strict deadlines.

    Internal: Teams are stretched; evidence lives in silos (BOLs, PODs, photos,
    emails); claims get deprioritized and paid short.

    Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose margin or customer trust because filing a
    claim is harder than shipping the freight.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know LTL OS&D claims are messy, fragmented, and time‑sensitive.

    Authority: Our AI standardizes evidence, values claims against common
    carrier tariffs and classes, assembles audit‑ready packets, files through
    carrier channels, and tracks every response with a clear audit trail.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Connect your TMS/WMS and drop in BOLs, PODs, photos, OS&D reports.

    2) AI triages cause, values the loss, and drafts a complete claim with
    exhibits.

    3) You approve; we file to carrier portals/email and track responses,
    reminders, and appeals.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Transparent pricing; cancel anytime.

    - You own your data; secure, permissioned access.

    - Simple onboarding; live support.

    Direct: Schedule a 15‑minute demo or start a pilot with your next 10 claims.
    Transitional: Download the OS&D Claims Playbook and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Higher recovery and approval rates; faster cycle times; fewer denials;
    reduced admin hours; consistent, audit‑ready documentation; improved cash
    flow and customer satisfaction.
  failure: >-
    Missed deadlines, incomplete packets, denials/underpayments, revenue
    leakage, long dispute cycles, wasted team time, and frustrated customers.
