leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High water costs and tightening allocations make over/under-irrigation
      financially risky; most nurseries lack reliable, zone-level runtimes tied
      to ETc and substrate behavior.
    - >-
      Existing tools are crop-agnostic or landscape-oriented, ignoring container
      substrate, container volume, canopy size, and microclimate, leading to
      10–30% water waste and higher plant loss.
    - >-
      Irrigation plans rarely connect to weekly/monthly water budgets or
      allocation permits, causing surprise overruns, fines, or forced cutbacks
      during peak demand.
    - >-
      Manual schedule setting is time-consuming (4–12 hours/week per 100 zones)
      and error-prone, with poor record-keeping for audits and buyer
      certifications.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation across weather sources, controllers, flow meters, and
      soil sensors prevents closed-loop optimization and anomaly detection
      (leaks, stuck valves, clogged emitters).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI scheduling engine computes daily runtimes per zone using
      forecast+observed ET0, crop coefficients (by species/canopy stage),
      substrate water-holding/flow-through, and irrigation system DU.
    - >-
      Weekly and monthly water budgeting aligned to allocation/permit limits;
      early overrun risk alerts and automated rebalancing suggestions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop control: integrate with controllers, flow meters, and optional
      soil moisture or weight sensors to auto-calibrate runtimes and detect
      anomalies.
    - >-
      Substrate and container library: presets for common mixes (e.g.,
      bark:peat:perlite ratios), pot sizes, and drainage characteristics; learns
      site-specific leaching fraction.
    - >-
      Compliance-ready logging and reporting (usage vs budget, ETc applied,
      variance, audit trails) for regulators and buyer certifications.
    - >-
      Multi-site, multi-block dashboards with mobile (offline-capable) workflows
      for scouting and quick runtime overrides, with guardrails to protect the
      water budget.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Daily, zone-level runtimes that fuse weather-driven ETc with substrate and
    container factors, plus a weekly water budget that keeps you compliant and
    under allocation—cut water use 15–35%, reduce plant loss, and reclaim labor
    hours, with payback in one season.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A nursery-specific AI engine trained on species/canopy/substrate
    interactions and closed-loop telemetry, plus a living library of
    substrate-container parameters and DU-aware adjustments. Controller-agnostic
    integrations and compliance-ready budgeting/reporting create high switching
    costs and defensibility through data network effects and validated M&V
    outcomes.

  character: >-
    Nursery and tree-production managers, growers, and irrigation supervisors
    who want precise, automated irrigation schedules that deliver uniform
    growth, conserve water, and simplify compliance—without constant manual
    adjustments.
  problem: >-
    External: Variable weather, diverse substrates/containers, water
    restrictions, and complex zone hydraulics make accurate runtimes hard.

    Internal: Frustration and uncertainty about over/under-watering, crop
    stress, and wasted labor.

    Philosophical: Water is a finite resource; growers shouldn’t have to guess
    to do the right thing.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand managing dozens to hundreds of zones with shifting ET
    and substrate conditions is stressful and time-consuming.

    Authority: Built by horticulture and irrigation experts; uses weather-driven
    ETc, substrate water-holding factors, and zone application rates. Integrates
    with sensors/controllers and provides audit-ready records.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Onboard zones: crop, container, substrate, application rate, constraints.

    2) Auto-ingest local weather to compute ETc; apply substrate and crop
    coefficients.

    3) Generate daily zone-level runtimes and weekly water budgets.

    4) Deliver work orders/API to controllers; monitor flow and adjust.

    5) Review budget vs. actual and refine settings.

    Agreement:

    - Transparent assumptions and editable targets.

    - Grower override at any time.

    - Data privacy and simple export—no lock-in.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo; Start a 30-day pilot on a subset of zones.

    Transitional: Download the water budget template; Run the irrigation ROI and
    water-risk calculator.
  success: |-
    - Consistent moisture and uniform growth across zones.
    - Lower water, energy, and rework costs with predictable weekly budgets.
    - Fewer crop losses and disease from over/under-watering.
    - Compliance-ready logs and easier audits.
    - Time saved for growers to focus on plant quality and shipping windows.
  failure: >-
    - Continued guessing on runtimes leading to stress, wasted water, and higher
    costs.

    - Crop variability, disease pressure, and missed ship dates from moisture
    swings.

    - Potential fines or restrictions due to overuse or runoff documentation
    gaps.
