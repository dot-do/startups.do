  problem:
    - >-
      Dealers spend 2–6 hours per quote across multiple tools (catalog PDFs,
      spreadsheets, CAD), causing long turnaround times and lost deals.
    - >-
      High configuration error rates (3–8% of orders) lead to rework, RMAs, and
      margin erosion due to invalid combinations of tops, bases, power, panels,
      and finishes.
    - >-
      SKU and option explosion in modular systems makes training slow; new reps
      take 60–90 days to become productive on complex lines.
    - >-
      Manufacturers struggle to maintain synchronized rules, pricing, and BOM
      logic across ERP, CAD/BIM, and dealer tools, creating version-control and
      audit headaches.
    - >-
      Customers expect real-time, photoreal 3D visualization and AR; current
      dealer tools are static or require expert CAD operators.
    - >-
      Discount leakage and inconsistent pricing policies occur across dealer
      networks due to manual overrides and misapplied tiers.
    - >-
      Change requests (layouts, finishes, accessories) generate time-consuming
      quote revisions and error risk.
    - >-
      Inability to rapidly configure multi-line bundles (desks + storage +
      partitions + seating) across brands reduces win rates on large projects.
    - >-
      Existing CPQ tools lack deep furniture-specific parametric rules (e.g.,
      power raceways, panel stack heights, ADA clearances) and
      cartonization/kitting logic.
    - >-
      Limited analytics on quote cycle, hit rates, and configuration trends
      hinder pricing strategy and product roadmap decisions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parametric 3D web configurator for desks, storage, partitions, and seating
      with constraint-based rules (dimensions, adjacency, power routing,
      ADA/ergonomics).
    - >-
      Real-time BOM and multi-tier pricing engine (list, dealer net, special
      pricing, project-specific terms) with margin guardrails and discount
      approvals.
    - >-
      AI-assisted guided selling: import 2D plans (PDF/DWG), Excel specs, or
      simple sketches to auto-generate valid starting configurations and
      floorplate layouts.
    - >-
      Instant photoreal WebGL rendering, materials/finish swaps, scene lighting,
      and AR viewer (USDZ/GLB) for end-customer buy-in.
    - >-
      Quote-to-order workflow: versioning, approvals, e-sign, and order export
      to ERP/PLM/PIM; supports partial releases and phased projects.
    - >-
      Multi-line bundling and cross-brand compatibility matrix to build
      mixed-manufacturer solutions while preserving each brand’s rules and
      pricing.
    - >-
      Shipping cartonization/kitting and lead-time estimator to set delivery
      expectations and optimize logistics cost on quotes.
    - >-
      CAD/BIM export (Revit families, DWG, IFC) and annotated 2D drawings from
      the configured model to streamline handoff to A&D and facility teams.
    - >-
      Analytics: quote cycle time, win/loss, margin analysis by dealer/region,
      configuration popularity, option attach rates.
    - >-
      Security/compliance: SSO, audit trails, permissions by dealer/territory,
      SOC 2 controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Dealer-facing 3D configurator + CPQ purpose-built for modular office
    systems: 10x faster quoting with 100% rule-valid configurations, instant
    photoreal 3D/AR, and live BOM/pricing synchronized to ERP—cutting rework by
    50%+ and lifting win rates and margins.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Manufacturer-verified, furniture-specific rules library and parametric
    assets for non-wood modular systems, combined with a high-performance
    browser renderer and AI layout models trained on real dealer quote
    patterns—difficult to replicate due to domain depth, data access, and
    integration breadth.
