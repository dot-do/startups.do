leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Multi-jurisdiction complexity: AAFCO (US), FDA labeling, and FEDIAF (EU)
      rules vary by market and change annually; state-level nuances (e.g., net
      content formats, calorie statement format) create inconsistency and risk.
    - >-
      Manual, error-prone reviews: Regulatory teams and designers manually check
      labels against long checklists; typical cycle 1–3 weeks with 2–4
      iterations, causing launch delays.
    - >-
      High cost of mistakes: Relabel/reprint costs $5k–$50k per SKU; regulatory
      holds or warning letters can trigger lost sales and retailer penalties;
      reputation risk from misleading claims.
    - >-
      Ingredient and GA mismatches: Frequent errors in ingredient order
      (descending by weight) and guaranteed analysis (GA) values vs formulation
      specs; claim substantiation gaps (e.g., 'natural,' 'human-grade,'
      'grain-free,' 'with/95%/25% rules').
    - >-
      Artwork issues: Noncompliant font size/contrast, missing mandatory
      statements (intended species, net quantity, nutritional adequacy, feeding
      directions, manufacturer/distributor), panel placement, and language
      localization flaws.
    - >-
      Scattered knowledge: Guidance spread across internal SOPs, consultants,
      and AAFCO OP; lack of traceable, citation-backed findings slows
      decision-making and audits.
    - >-
      Scaling SKUs/markets: Private labels and co-packers manage hundreds of
      SKUs across NA/EU; maintaining consistent compliance across variants is
      difficult.
    - >-
      Limited post-change control: Teams lack an auditable trail of what
      changed, who approved, and which regulation was satisfied after each
      revision.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven label and artwork analysis: OCR and panel detection extract
      text/structure; vision models assess mandatory panels and typography.
    - >-
      Rules + ML hybrid engine: Deterministic checks for mandatory statements;
      ML classifiers for claim risk; numeric validators for GA/calories;
      ingredient order cross-checked with formulation upload.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction selector and state variants: Apply AAFCO/FDA baseline plus
      state-specific nuances; EU/FEDIAF templates with language/decimal and
      nutrition statement requirements.
    - >-
      Redlines with citations: Inline annotations referencing AAFCO OP section,
      FDA CFR, and FEDIAF clauses; severity scoring (critical/major/minor) and
      fix suggestions.
    - >-
      Guaranteed Analysis and claim substantiation assistant: Validates GA math,
      moisture conversion, and flags claims needing substantiation; provides
      evidence templates.
    - >-
      Exportable compliance package: One-click PDF/Excel checklist, change log,
      and regulator-ready evidence pack; version diffs for sequential artwork.
    - >-
      Workflow integration: Assign tasks, approvals, and SLAs; APIs/connectors
      for PLM and artwork tools; Single Sign-On and audit logs.
    - >-
      Continuous updates: Regulatory change monitoring; models retrained on
      anonymized outcomes; dashboard flags labels affected by new rules.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Upload your dog/cat food label or artwork, choose your market (US AAFCO/FDA,
    EU FEDIAF), and receive audit-grade redlines with exact citations and a
    ready-to-file compliance checklist in minutes—not weeks—reducing relabel
    risk by 50–80% and cutting approval cycles by 60–80%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously learning, citation-backed knowledge graph purpose-built for
    pet food labeling across AAFCO/FDA/FEDIAF, trained on a large, proprietary
    corpus of real labels and regulator outcomes; deep integrations into
    PLM/artwork tools; and a human-in-the-loop network that closes gaps,
    generating feedback data competitors lack. This produces faster, more
    accurate, and auditable redlines than generic document checkers or
    manual-only workflows.
