  problem:
    - >-
      Economic nexus and apportionment rules vary by state and change
      frequently, making it hard for tax preparers to stay current and
      consistent.
    - >-
      Manual screening and apportionment workpapers consume 2–6 hours per client
      annually, limiting firm capacity and margins.
    - >-
      Inconsistent sourcing (market-based vs. cost-of-performance),
      throwback/throwout rules, and P.L. 86-272 determinations create material
      risk of missed filings or over-filing.
    - >-
      Data needed for accurate apportionment (sales, payroll, property by state)
      lives across GLs, payroll systems, and fixed-asset registers; mapping is
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Firms lack a repeatable, auditable process to defend positions during
      state audits; penalties and interest can be significant.
    - >-
      Existing enterprise solutions are costly and overbuilt for SMB-focused
      firms; spreadsheets are brittle and unscalable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion connectors unify sales, payroll, and property by state from
      GLs (QBO, Xero, NetSuite), payroll (Gusto, ADP), and fixed-asset
      registers.
    - >-
      Rules engine monitors economic nexus thresholds (e.g., sales
      dollar/transaction counts) and income/franchise tax standards per state
      with effective dates and industry nuances.
    - >-
      AI-assisted classification maps revenue to market-based or
      cost-of-performance sourcing; flags likely throwback/throwout exposure and
      P.L. 86-272 protection risk via a guided questionnaire.
    - >-
      Automated apportionment factor computation (single-sales factor, 3-factor,
      weighted factors) with state overrides and period selection
      (CY/FY/rolling).
    - >-
      Filing obligation matrix with confidence scores, “why” explanations, and
      links to authority; export to workpapers and major tax platforms.
    - >-
      Scenario analysis (e.g., new warehouse in IL, remote hires in MA) to
      forecast footprint changes and tax impact.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring: alerts when trailing-12 or calendar thresholds are
      crossed; suggested effective nexus dates.
    - >-
      Audit-ready report pack: methodology, data sources, rule citations, and
      change log for each client/entity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10-minute multi-state nexus screening and apportionment with automated data
    ingestion, state-specific rules continuously updated, and audit-ready
    workpapers—cutting prep time by 2–4 hours per entity per year while
    improving accuracy and defensibility.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Continuously updated, citation-linked state rules knowledge graph combined
    with human-in-the-loop AI that produces audit-ready workpapers and
    integrates directly with the top accounting/payroll systems—creating a
    defensible loop of accuracy, trust, and switching costs as firms standardize
    their SALT workflows on the platform.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Tax prep firms, CPA practices, and SALT teams serving multi-state business
    clients who want fast, defensible filing determinations and accurate
    apportionment.
  problem: >-
    Tracking 50-state nexus thresholds and apportionment rules by hand is slow
    and fragile—teams feel overwhelmed, and it shouldn’t require guesswork to
    stay compliant—resulting in missed registrations, over/underpayments, and
    audit risk.
  guide: >-
    We’re an AI screener trained on current state thresholds and apportionment
    methods. We understand busy-season pressure and deliver authoritative,
    explainable outputs with clear reasoning you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload or sync client sales/payroll/property by state. 2) We test
    economic and physical nexus thresholds and compute state-specific
    apportionment factors. 3) Receive filing recommendations and a
    workpaper-ready report with export options.
  callToAction: >-
    Run a free single-client screen or book a 15-minute demo; upgrade for batch
    processing, API access, and workpaper exports.
  success: >-
    Consistent, compliant multi-state returns; hours saved per engagement;
    standardized documentation; fewer notices; happier clients; scalable SALT
    revenue.
  failure: >-
    Without it, guesswork leads to missed nexus, penalties, amended returns,
    write-offs, and client churn.
