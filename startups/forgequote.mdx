  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs for forged iron/steel parts arrive as mixed formats (PDF drawings,
      STEP/IGES/CATIA files) making triage and quoting slow (1–5 days) and
      error‑prone.
    - >-
      Estimators spend 1–3 hours per RFQ extracting geometry, sizing billet,
      selecting press/hammer, approximating sequences, and calculating yield;
      knowledge is tribal and varies by estimator.
    - >-
      Inconsistent and slow quoting hurts win rates against faster shops; buyers
      increasingly expect 24–48 hour turnaround and DFM feedback up front.
    - >-
      Cost estimates often deviate 10–25% from actuals due to poor yield/cycle
      assumptions, missing draft/fillet info, and unmodeled secondary operations
      (heat treat, trim, shot blast, NDT).
    - >-
      Press/hammer capacity and die-life impacts aren’t quantified early,
      causing late re-quoting or missed capacity constraints.
    - >-
      Security/ITAR concerns limit use of generic cloud AI; many shops need
      on‑prem or controlled cloud with strict data isolation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated RFQ ingestion from email/portals; parses PDFs (OCR + GD&T), 2D
      drawings, and 3D CAD (STEP/IGES/SolidWorks/NX/CATIA) to extract features
      and material callouts.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models estimate forming force, number of
      blows/strokes, cycle time, and select feasible press/hammer based on
      tonnage, stroke, die size, and envelope.
    - >-
      Yield and buy-to-fly calculator using volume, flash allowance, draft,
      trim, and preform assumptions calibrated to historical runs.
    - >-
      Comprehensive cost model: material + energy + labor + overhead + tooling
      amortization + heat treat + machining + surface finishing + inspection/NDT
      + scrap/rework factors.
    - >-
      DFM rule engine flags issues (insufficient draft, sharp internal corners,
      thin webs, parting line conflicts, deep blind holes) and proposes
      alternatives (radii/draft changes, material substitutions, split-line
      options).
    - >-
      Quote generator with traceability: line-item breakdowns, confidence
      scores, and annotated DFM notes; exports to ERP/CPQ (Epicor, Infor, Plex,
      SAP) and CRM.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workflow for estimators to adjust assumptions,
      add vendor quotes (heat treat, machining), and lock pricing.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS (SOC 2) and on‑prem/GovCloud for ITAR/EAR
      with per-tenant data isolation.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From RFQ to a defensible, costed quote with press selection, cycle time,
    yield, and DFM notes in under 60 minutes at ±10% cost accuracy, securely
    integrated with your ERP—standardizing tribal knowledge and increasing quote
    throughput 2–3x.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
