leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Foam plants struggle to consistently hit density/ILD/rise specs due to raw
      material variability (polyols, isocyanates, catalysts, surfactants),
      ambient changes, and line drift.
    - >-
      Scrap and rework rates typically 4–10% by weight; each 1% reduction can
      save $150k–$400k per plant annually, yet many plants lack predictive tools
      beyond SPC charts and operator experience.
    - >-
      Trial-and-error recipe adjustments (e.g., water/catalyst/index) are slow,
      risky, and often exceed safe change windows, causing overcorrection and
      more scrap.
    - >-
      Quality results (ILD, density, rise) are often known hours after pour;
      late feedback leads to entire bun or batch scrap instead of early
      intervention.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal; workforce turnover undermines process capability
      (Cp/Cpk), and best practices are not systematized across shifts and
      plants.
    - >-
      Existing APC/SCADA/MES tools are generic, lack foam-specific physics and
      guardrails, and cannot propose precise, safe micro-adjustments tied to
      final part specs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Foam-specific predictive models for density/ILD/rise that use early inline
      signals to forecast final properties with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Constrained auto-recipe tuner that proposes micro-adjustments within
      validated safe envelopes (materials, index, temperatures, throughput) and
      respects EHS/QA guardrails.
    - >-
      What-if simulator that quantifies expected impact of candidate tweaks on
      Cp/Cpk and spec conformance before execution.
    - >-
      Early-warning engine: within 3–5 minutes of pour, flags likely out-of-spec
      buns and recommends immediate corrective actions (slow line, adjust
      index/water, pause).
    - >-
      Drift detection and root-cause insights (e.g., ambient humidity increase,
      polyol lot shift, pump wear) with explainability for engineers/operators.
    - >-
      Workflow with e-signoffs, audit trails (ISO 9001/IATF 16949), and
      role-based control; advisory mode and optional closed-loop setpoint API to
      PLC.
    - >-
      Pre-built connectors to common PLC/SCADA/MES/lab systems; on-prem edge
      deployment to protect proprietary formulations.
    - >-
      Commissioning playbook including DoE-based model calibration in 2–4 weeks;
      quarterly model refresh and value reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit density/ILD/rise specs the first time. FoamSpec AI predicts outcomes
    within minutes of pour and recommends safe, small formulation and process
    tweaks (e.g., ±0.5 php water, ±0.005 php catalyst, ±1 index) to reduce scrap
    20–40%, stabilize quality, and capture 3–8x ROI in under 90 days—deployed
    securely on-prem with foam-specific physics and safety guardrails.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Foam-specific, safety-guarded auto-tuning with validated micro-adjustment
    envelopes and pre-built OEM/supplier integrations, plus a growing anonymized
    benchmark dataset across lines that accelerates deployment and accuracy
    while keeping customer recipes on-prem.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Plant managers and process/quality engineers in urethane and other foam
    product manufacturing (NAICS 326150) who need every bun to hit
    density/ILD/rise specs, cut scrap, and ship on time.
  problem: >-
    External: Raw-material variability, environmental swings, and equipment
    drift cause density/ILD/rise misses, rework, and scrap. Internal: Constant
    pressure to hit spec without guesswork and avoid costly downtime or unsafe
    tweaks. Philosophical: Quality should be predictable—formulation and process
    changes must be data-driven and safe.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know foam lines—one small mis-tweak can ruin a bun and a shift.
    Authority: Field-tested AI trained on your historical runs and lab data;
    designed with safety-first guardrails, audit trails, and plant integration
    (PLC/SCADA/LIMS). Confidential by default—your data stays yours.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data: Import recent run, lab, and environment data; map
    formulations; set safe tweak bounds. 2) Calibrate: Predict density/ILD/rise;
    validate on holdout runs; enable guardrails and change-logs. 3) Run & scale:
    Start on one line/recipe family with operator-in-the-loop recommendations;
    expand after ROI review. Risk reduction: 4-week pilot, no lock-in, data
    ownership retained, rollback anytime.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot to see scrap and variance drop. Transitional: Book a
    30-minute demo; get a sample variance report and ROI calculator; use our
    data-readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    - More first-pass runs hitting density/ILD/rise. - Lower scrap and rework. -
    Stable rise profiles and consistent quality across shifts. - Faster startups
    and changeovers. - Reduced chemical waste and energy use. - Clear, auditable
    change histories for QA and customers. - Higher OEE and on-time delivery;
    confident operators.
  failure: >-
    - Ongoing spec misses and firefighting. - Guesswork tweaks that risk safety
    or quality. - Rising material costs, scrap, and rework. - Missed ship dates,
    chargebacks, and customer churn. - Operator burnout and tribal-knowledge
    fragility.
