    modelCapability: 7
    overall: 8
  risks:
    - Incorrect parameter leading to scrap

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High scrap and rework rates (5–20% typical on new/nonsteady parts) due to
      inconsistent process windows across alloys, presses, and die conditions
    - >-
      Tacit tribal knowledge concentrated in senior metallurgists and shop-floor
      leads; risk of loss with retirements and turnover
    - >-
      Slow, trial-and-error process development for new parts (2–6 weeks) and
      changeovers, tying up capacity and delaying customer delivery
    - >-
      Inconsistent or incomplete job travelers/work instructions leading to
      parameter drift and nonconformances (AS9100/NADCAP findings)
    - >-
      Poor integration between historical run data (MES/ERP), press/PLC data,
      die history, and FEA outputs; insights are siloed
    - >-
      Unplanned die wear and over/under-heating cycles shorten die life and
      increase tooling cost
    - >-
      Limited closed-loop learning: lessons from each run are rarely captured
      and generalized across families of parts
    - >-
      Difficulty proving process control and traceability during audits
      (temperature, stroke speed, lubrication, dwell times, eSign-offs)
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven parameter recommender that outputs temperature windows, press
      stroke/speed profiles, lubrication type/amount, die preheat/soak, reheats,
      and dwell times based on alloy, press capabilities, die history, and past
      runs
    - >-
      Digital traveler generator that produces operator-ready,
      AS9100/NADCAP-friendly work instructions with eSign, hold points, and
      real-time parameter checks
    - >-
      Data connectors to MES/ERP (e.g., Epicor, Infor, Plex), press PLCs
      (Rockwell/Siemens), historians (OSIsoft PI/Ignition), and FEA
      (DEFORM/QForm/Forge NxT)
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: post-run data ingestion updates models, flags drift,
      and proposes continuous improvements to process windows and travelers
    - >-
      Risk scoring and simulation-assisted validation for new parts or
      significant changes; recommends trial billets and thermocouple placements
    - >-
      Operator apps (tablet/terminal) for step-by-step guidance, digital checks,
      photos, and deviations with immediate escalation and corrective action
      prompts
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap, speed up process development, and standardize compliant work
    instructions by using AI to recommend validated forging windows and
    auto-generate digital travelers tailored to alloy, press, die condition, and
    historical performance—closed-loop and audit-ready.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific, metallurgically constrained recommendation engine trained
    on multi-plant nonferrous data plus tight integrations with press controls,
    die history, and FEA—producing audit-ready travelers. Early partnerships
    with press OEMs and FEA vendors create data scale and validation loops that
    are difficult to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Nonferrous forging engineers, planners, and supervisors who need repeatable,
    right‑first‑time parameters and clear job travelers.
  problem: >-
    External: Every alloy/press/die combo behaves differently and knowledge is
    scattered across spreadsheets and memories; mistakes cause scrap and delays.
    Internal: Teams feel pressure to hit schedule without drama. Philosophical:
    Shop expertise should be captured and shared, not gambled on.
  guide: >-
    We understand nonferrous forging. Our AI pairs metallurgical rules with your
    historical runs to recommend safe, efficient forging windows and
    auto‑generate traveler steps your crews trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect prior runs, alloy data, die/press specs, and constraints. 2)
    Calibrate recommendations and traveler templates with your SMEs. 3) Pilot on
    one part family, then roll out with QA sign‑off.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute pilot scoping. Transitional: Request a sample
    digital traveler and recommendation report.
  success: >-
    Parameters set in minutes, fewer reworks and retries, consistent travelers,
    faster onboarding, captured know‑how, higher throughput, and better on‑time
    delivery.
  failure: >-
    Without it: slow setups, parameter guesswork, inconsistent travelers,
    avoidable scrap and cracked forgings, overtime firefighting, and lost
    expertise when people leave.
