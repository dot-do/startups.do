  problem:
    - >-
      Manual, county-by-county retrieval of deeds, liens, tax and HOA documents
      is slow (1–3 business days), error-prone, and costly ($35–$120 per order
      in labor + vendor fees).
    - >-
      Fragmented data sources (county recorder, tax collector, assessor, HOA
      portals, court records) require multiple logins, variable schemas, and
      inconsistent indexing/naming conventions.
    - >-
      Production teams must re-key and normalize legal descriptions, parcel IDs
      (APNs), and grantor/grantee data into title production systems (SoftPro,
      ResWare, RamQuest), driving cycle-time delays and QC rework.
    - >-
      Turnaround time variability causes SLA misses for lenders/realtors,
      elevates cancellation risk, and contributes to revenue leakage in
      high-volume months.
    - >-
      Missing or mis-indexed instruments (e.g., subordinate liens, unreleased
      mortgages, UCCs, HOA covenants) lead to post-closing curative work, claims
      exposure, and reputational risk.
    - >-
      Carriers lack real-time coverage and confidence telemetry (Which counties
      are automated? What’s the retrieval hit-rate?) to manage operations and
      vendor spend.
    - >-
      Peak workloads and state-by-state differences force overstaffing or
      outsourcing, driving inconsistent quality and compliance challenges.
    - >-
      Security and audit demands (PII, SOC 2, ALTA Best Practices) complicate
      onboarding new vendors and add overhead to in-house automation efforts.
  solution:
    - >-
      API and no-code workflow that ingests an order (address, APN,
      borrower/seller names, legal, county/state).
    - >-
      Automated orchestration to targeted sources: recorder/land records, tax
      collector/assessor, court records, and HOA portals/directories.
    - >-
      AI-driven document discovery using adaptive search patterns, OCR, and
      record-linking to identify relevant instruments across spelling/legal
      variants and grantor/grantee chains.
    - >-
      Document classification and entity extraction (instrument type, parties,
      dates, amounts, parcel/legal, book/page, instrument numbers) with
      confidence scoring and deduplication.
    - >-
      Chain-of-title assembly (e.g., 20–40 year) with exception tagging (gaps,
      unreleased liens, mismatches) and tax/HOA status normalization.
    - >-
      Automated mapping to the title order in SoftPro/ResWare/RamQuest via
      prebuilt connectors; index fields populate the correct
      screens/requirements with attachments and naming conventions.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review only for low-confidence cases with clear
      thresholds, ensuring SLA without blanket outsourcing.
    - >-
      Dashboard and alerts: coverage heatmaps by county, SLA adherence,
      confidence distributions, manual touch rates, and exception queues.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 Type II roadmap, encrypted transit/at-rest,
      PII minimization, full audit trail of retrieval and classification
      decisions.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Make every title order file-ready in minutes: automated retrieval and
    indexing of deeds, liens, taxes, and HOA docs mapped directly to your order
    with audit-grade confidence, cutting turnaround by 60%+ and per-order cost
    by 40%+ without sacrificing compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned models trained on a large, growing corpus of labeled,
    county-diverse title instruments with verified order mappings; deep,
    prebuilt integrations into title production systems; and coverage telemetry
    that optimizes retrieval pathways per county, lowering COGS and improving
    SLA in ways generic automation cannot easily replicate.

  character: >-
    Direct title insurance underwriting and production teams who want every
    relevant property instrument in one place so they can issue accurate
    commitments and policies quickly.
  problem: >-
    - Villain: Fragmented county/tax/HOA systems and scattered PDFs slow
    everything down.

    - External: Manually finding deeds, liens, taxes, judgments, and HOA docs is
    time-consuming and error-prone.

    - Internal: Examiners worry about missing instruments and wasting hours on
    re-keying instead of underwriting.

    - Philosophical: Borrowers and lenders deserve clean, transparent title with
    no last-minute surprises.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to clear title fast without increasing risk. Our
    title-focused AI fetches and indexes relevant instruments and auto-maps them
    to each order, delivering complete, searchable files with audit trails and
    transparency.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Configure secure access and set search profiles by
    jurisdiction/order type.

    - Automate: We retrieve deeds, liens, taxes, judgments, and HOA documents,
    normalize metadata, and map instruments to the order, parties, and legal
    description.

    - Review: Examiners review flagged exceptions and export/sync the indexed
    package to your production workflow.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a 20‑minute demo or launch a limited pilot on recent
    orders.

    - Transitional: Download a sample indexed file and get a time-saved/ROI
    estimate.
  success: |-
    - Faster clear-to-close with complete, searchable files
    - Fewer misses and less post-close curative work
    - Lower manual minutes per order and overtime
    - Audit-ready traceability for each instrument
    - Scale volume without adding headcount
    - Happier lenders, agents, and borrowers
  failure: |-
    - Delayed commitments and rushed closings
    - Missed liens or unpaid taxes leading to claims exposure
    - Costly rework, overtime, and examiner burnout
    - Lost referrals and reduced confidence from lenders/borrowers
