leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Over/under-irrigation due to guesswork on ET, soil AWC, and uncertain
      rainfall, leading to yield loss (3–10 bu/ac) or wasted water/energy.
    - >-
      Center pivots and pumps have finite capacity; growers struggle to
      prioritize fields/pivots during peak ET weeks, causing stress on sandier
      zones and missed irrigation windows.
    - >-
      Rising energy costs ($40–90/ac/season for pumping) and water restrictions
      require precise scheduling and auditable records.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented (weather apps, soil surveys, pivot controllers,
      sensors). No single, farm-wide plan optimizes across fields, wells, and
      labor.
    - >-
      Existing tools are either too generic (not calibrated to soil
      AWC/capacity), too hardware-heavy (costly probes everywhere), or locked to
      one OEM ecosystem.
    - >-
      Compliance pressures from NRDs/water districts and insurers demand
      irrigation logs and water-use reports that are tedious to produce.
  solution:
    - >-
      Daily and weekly runtime recommendations per pivot/zone using soil AWC, ET
      (modeled + satellite-adjusted), observed/forecast rainfall, and
      pump/system capacity.
    - >-
      Multi-pivot optimizer that prioritizes fields under limited capacity or
      water allocation, accounting for travel times, well output, and labor
      windows.
    - >-
      Actionable outputs: pivot run hours, start/stop windows, VRI suggestions,
      and alerts when rainfall/ET forecasts shift.
    - >-
      Simple compliance reporting: per-field water use estimates, logs, and
      exportable PDFs/CSV for NRD/insurer audits.
    - >-
      Plug-and-play integrations with OEM controllers/telemetry (no probes
      required; optional sensor calibration where available).
    - >-
      ROI tracking dashboard showing water saved (ac-in), kWh/$ saved, and yield
      protection estimates validated against grower data.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Capacity-aware, field-level irrigation plans that hit ET targets while
    saving 2–5 in water/ac and $8–15/ac in energy, protecting 3–7 bu/ac
    yield—OEM-agnostic, sensor-optional, and auditable.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary, OEM-agnostic, capacity-aware irrigation optimizer trained on
    multi-million-acre seasons of pivot runtime/outcome data, integrated
    directly with major controllers, and backed by transparent accuracy metrics
    and an outcomes-based ROI guarantee.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Corn growers who want precise, hassle-free irrigation that protects yield
    and water.
  problem: >-
    Irrigation timing and amounts are guesswork—weather shifts, variable soils,
    and system limits make it easy to over/under-water, wasting energy and
    risking bushels.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to hit yield and water targets. Our AI blends ET,
    soil AWC, rainfall, and system capacity—grounded in agronomy best practices
    and on-farm validation—to deliver clear, actionable schedules.
  plan: >-
    - Connect fields: soils/AWC, pivot or drip capacity, target refill levels.

    - We run a daily water balance using ET, rainfall, and system limits.

    - Receive daily/weekly runtime and inches-per-zone recommendations with
    alerts; apply and we update the plan automatically.
  callToAction: Start a 14-day pilot or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Confident, data-driven irrigation: steadier yields, lower water and energy
    use, fewer field checks, and documented decisions for compliance and
    partners.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing—over/under-irrigate, overspend on pumping, stress crops, lose
    yield, and erode local water resources.

    title: AI Irrigation Scheduling for Corn
    subtitle: >-
      Daily and weekly irrigation recommendations using soil AWC, ET, rainfall,
      and your system’s capacity—field by field.
    ctaText: Get Started
    ctaHref: /get-started
  problem:
    - Over- or under-watering cuts yield and wastes fuel.
    - Weather swings and scattered storms make guesswork risky.
    - Soils vary across fields; one schedule doesn’t fit all.
    - Pivots and pumps have limits—capacity bottlenecks derail plans.
    - 'Manually combining ET, rainfall, and soil data is slow and error-prone.'
    - Crew coordination and recordkeeping take too much time.
  solution:
    - Actionable targets by date and depth—know when and how much to irrigate.
    - 'Field-by-field soil water balance using AWC, ET, rainfall, and root depth.'
    - Plans that respect your pivot/pipe capacity and turnaround times.
    - Daily updates plus a weekly plan to organize crews and equipment.
    - Alerts before depletion hits critical thresholds by growth stage.
    - Simple logging of applied inches keeps the plan synced and auditable.
  features:
    - Dynamic soil water balance per field/zone using AWC and crop stage.
    - ET-driven recommendations from trusted weather data and models.
    - 'System capacity modeling: gpm, set times, pivot speed, and run windows.'
    - >-
      Rainfall from gauges with radar-assisted estimates and forecast
      integration.
    - Depletion thresholds tailored to crop stage and management style.
    - Variable Rate Irrigation support with zone-level scheduling.
    - Multi-field dashboard and map with color-coded priority status.
    - SMS/email/app alerts for “Irrigate by” dates and rainfall impacts.
    - Quick import of field boundaries (CSV/Shape/GeoJSON) and equipment specs.
    - Season summaries and application reports for audits and ROI analysis.
  steps:
    - 'Add fields and irrigation systems (pivot, drip, or pipe) with capacities.'
    - Select soil profile or set custom AWC and rooting depth.
    - 'Set crop details: planting date and growth stage tracking.'
    - Choose weather source and enable forecast updates.
    - Review daily targets and the weekly schedule by field/zone.
    - 'Irrigate, log applied inches, and let the model update automatically.'
