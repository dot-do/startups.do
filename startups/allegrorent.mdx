leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual rental intake at the start of school terms overwhelms staff,
      causing long lines, errors, and lost rentals.
    - >-
      Paper contracts and standalone e-sign tools are not linked to inventory,
      so serial numbers, maintenance plans, and tax rules are misapplied.
    - >-
      Payment methods are not securely vaulted or tied to automated dunning,
      leading to late/missed payments and high DSO.
    - >-
      Fraud and identity issues (fake/invalid IDs, stolen cards) create
      chargebacks and inventory loss.
    - >-
      Retailers lack demand forecasting by school/district/instrument, causing
      stockouts on high-demand SKUs and idle inventory on others.
    - >-
      Existing POS/rental solutions are generic or rip-and-replace; music
      retailers want a layer that integrates with current POS and workflows.
    - >-
      Parents expect mobile-first, bilingual, 5-minute self-serve applications;
      retailers lose conversions without this experience.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve, mobile-first rental application with parent-friendly UX and
      bilingual flows; optimized for ‘rental night’ spikes.
    - >-
      Real-time ID capture and verification with AI-powered OCR and fraud
      scoring; optional soft credit/eligibility checks.
    - >-
      Legally compliant e-sign with auto-filled contract terms, school
      calendars, and localized tax rules.
    - >-
      Tokenized payment vault (cards/ACH), automated recurring billing, smart
      dunning, and late-fee logic.
    - >-
      Inventory assignment that links SKUs/serials to contracts; barcode/QR scan
      at handoff; swap/upgrade workflows.
    - >-
      AI insights: demand forecasting by school/district/instrument,
      fraud/chargeback risk, dunning optimization, and staffing forecasts.
    - >-
      Integrations-first approach with popular POS/accounting/payment/tax
      systems; no rip-and-replace required.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Approve and onboard student instrument rentals in minutes—not days—while
    cutting admin time in half and driving on-time payments to 97%+. AllegroRent
    AI is the only music-rental-first, integration-friendly platform that
    unifies online intake, ID verification, e-sign, inventory assignment, and
    recurring billing with AI-driven fraud detection and school-season demand
    forecasting.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Music-rental-first data network and models: seasonality and demand by
    school/district/instrument, combined with integrated billing outcomes,
    enabling precise forecasting and fraud/dunning optimization that generic
    rental or POS systems cannot match. Plus deep, certified integrations that
    let retailers keep their POS while gaining automation.
