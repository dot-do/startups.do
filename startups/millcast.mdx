leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Weekly demand is volatile at SKU/customer/region level due to seasonality
      (grow-out cycles, harvests), weather, and contract timing; spreadsheet
      forecasts yield high WAPE (25–45%) and bias (+/–10%), causing stockouts
      and obsolete inventory.
    - >-
      Production plans ignore real constraints (press/pellet line rates,
      conditioning time, mixer/packaging bottlenecks, micro-dosing limits,
      sanitation/flush requirements for medicated formulas), producing
      infeasible schedules and last-minute firefighting.
    - >-
      Changeovers and sanitation/flushes are not sequenced optimally; mills lose
      8–20% of available hours to cleanouts and retooling when formulations and
      pellet sizes are poorly batched.
    - >-
      Ingredient lead times and variability (vitamins, amino acids, premixes,
      fats) are not connected to production plans; expediting costs and rush
      freight rise 15–40% in tight markets.
    - >-
      Service levels to growers/integrators fall below 95% during seasonal
      peaks; late deliveries disrupt feeding programs and animal performance,
      damaging long-term contracts.
    - >-
      Capacity decisions (shifts, overtime, preventive maintenance timing) are
      made reactively, raising OT by 10–25% and lowering OEE by 5–10 points.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across ERP (orders/BOMs), MES/SCADA (rates, downtime),
      and spreadsheets (constraints); planners spend 6–12 hours/week wrangling
      data instead of optimizing plans.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion and harmonization: Connect to ERP (orders, BOMs, routings),
      MES/SCADA (actual rates, downtime), WMS/TMS (shipments), and external
      signals (weather, commodity trends, herd/flock cycles). Automated data
      quality checks and schema mapping in 2–4 weeks.
    - >-
      Probabilistic, hierarchical forecasting at SKU x customer x region x week
      using intermittent-demand models, hierarchical reconciliation, and
      exogenous drivers (weather, production cycles). Outputs include
      P10/P50/P90 demand and bias diagnostics.
    - >-
      Constraint-based production planning: Mixed-Integer optimization that
      models line/press rates, mixer/packaging capacities, shift calendars,
      maintenance windows, changeover matrix (pellet size/formula),
      sanitation/flush rules for medicated/allergen products,
      micro-dosing/hand-add limits, and loadout capacity.
    - >-
      Inventory and procurement alignment: Translate plans into ingredient
      requirements with projected on-hand, safety stock (service-level
      optimized), supplier lead times/MOQs, and generate reorder/expedite
      recommendations.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: What-if simulations for demand surges, downtime events,
      ingredient shortages, and shift/overtime policies; compare cost, service,
      and CO2/ton outcomes.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: Publish planned orders to ERP/MES, track schedule
      adherence, learn from deviations, and auto-tune models weekly. Role-based
      dashboards for planners, ops, and sales.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    MillCast AI delivers SKU/customer/region forecasts and a provably feasible
    weekly production schedule that respects capacity, changeovers, and
    compliance rules—achieving 97–99% service levels with 15–30% fewer
    changeover hours and payback in under 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A feed-industry-specific optimization engine with validated changeover/flush
    rules and prebuilt ERP/MES connectors enables go-live in 6–8 weeks and
    delivers feasible schedules on day one; an anonymized industry benchmark
    dataset improves cold-start accuracy and continuous learning in ways generic
    APS tools cannot match.

    Operations, supply chain, and production leaders at animal feed mills who
    want reliable SKU/customer/region forecasts and feasible weekly production
    plans that hit service levels without excess inventory or overtime.
  problem: >-
    External: Volatile demand by SKU and region, long changeovers, finite
    capacity, and ingredient constraints create constant firefighting. Internal:
    Spreadsheets and ERP exports can’t keep up—teams miss orders, run costly
    rushes, and work weekends. Philosophical: Planning feed shouldn’t be
    guesswork; mills deserve a calm, data-driven schedule they can trust.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the realities of feed manufacturing—seasonality,
    promotions, and complex changeovers. Authority: Purpose-built for mills,
    combining proven forecasting with constraint-based scheduling; integrates
    with your ERP/MES; references available.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Ingest orders/shipments, customer hierarchy, recipes/BOMs,
    routings, capacities, and changeover matrices. 2) Calibrate: Train SKU-level
    models, validate accuracy with your team, configure constraints, and
    generate trial weekly schedules. 3) Go Live: Auto-generate weekly plans, run
    what-if scenarios, track KPIs, and iterate with ongoing support—no
    rip-and-replace.

    changeovers and rushes; better schedule adherence and throughput; reduced
    overtime; aligned Sales–Ops; clear visibility from forecast to mill
    schedule.
