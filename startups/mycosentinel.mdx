  problem:
    - >-
      Early-stage contamination (Trichoderma, cobweb, bacterial blotch, dry
      bubble) is frequently missed during manual scouting—leading to 1–5%
      avoidable yield loss and higher discard rates.
    - >-
      Detection often occurs days late, after sporulation or spread to adjacent
      trays/rooms, increasing sanitation costs and downtime.
    - >-
      Inconsistent record-keeping and lack of quantified thresholds make it hard
      to standardize IPM responses and train staff across shifts and sites.
    - >-
      Existing climate-control systems don’t see biological symptoms; farms lack
      automated, room-level visual intelligence.
    - >-
      Limited skilled labor for reliable, high-frequency inspections; language
      barriers and turnover reduce scouting quality.
    - >-
      No clear, quantified feedback loop between interventions (humidity, air
      speed, sanitation) and disease outcomes to optimize SOPs.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy vision models (edge or cloud) that detect Trichoderma, cobweb,
      bacterial blotch, dry bubble, and hygiene issues from phone uploads and
      fixed cameras.
    - >-
      Room-level risk scoring and heatmaps, with severity trends and
      time-to-containment predictions.
    - >-
      Actionable playbooks: stepwise SOP recommendations tied to severity
      (isolate, adjust humidity/airflow, sanitation, harvest prioritization).
    - >-
      Alerts integrated to WhatsApp/SMS/radio/SCADA with multilingual
      instructions; task assignment and verification photos.
    - >-
      Dashboards for QA/operations: incident rates, response times, costed
      yield-at-risk, and intervention outcomes.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to climate systems (e.g., setpoint change
      suggestions), farm management software, and traceability logs.
    - >-
      Facility-specific model fine-tuning to reduce false positives/negatives as
      more local data is captured.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, AI-powered visual scouting that detects and triages
    contamination 24/7, enabling earlier interventions (1–3 days sooner),
    standardized SOP actions, and measurable yield protection (target 0.5–2.0%
    reduction in loss) with a fast ROI (<3 months in large farms).
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Facility-specific model fine-tuning powered by proprietary, longitudinal
    image datasets linked to interventions and outcomes, plus OEM partnerships
    embedding vision into climate workflows—making accuracy and integration
    improve with each season and site.

  character: >-
    Commercial mushroom growers, farm managers, and QA teams who want early,
    reliable contamination detection and clear triage to protect yield and
    standardize response.
  problem: >-
    Trichoderma, cobweb mold, and bacterial blotch spread fast; manual scouting
    is inconsistent and late—leading to room dumps, wasted substrate and labor,
    lost yield, and the stress of always playing catch-up.
  guide: >-
    We understand NAICS 111411 operations and mushroom pathogens; our computer
    vision is trained on thousands of annotated farm images and pairs agronomy
    know-how with ML for practical, biosecure, privacy-first workflows that fit
    your SOPs.
  plan: >-
    1) Snap or upload grow-room images (phone or fixed cameras). 2) Get instant
    detection with confidence, hotspot maps, and risk-ranked triage. 3) Follow
    recommended actions (isolate, treat, adjust climate, clean) and auto-log
    outcomes for audits.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot; upload your first 100 photos free;
    optional API for camera feeds.
  success: >-
    Proactive biosecurity with fewer outbreaks and dumps, higher yield and
    quality, faster turnaround, reduced chemical use, trained staff, and a clear
    audit trail across rooms and cycles.
  failure: >-
    Without early detection, contamination spreads, rooms are quarantined or
    dumped, labor and substrate are wasted, margins erode, and buyer confidence
    declines.
