  title: Double Seam QA Analyzer (Images + Measurements)
  description: >-
    Analyze seam micrometer/teardown data and cross-section images; recommend
    specific roll/chuck adjustments.
  targetUsers:
    - Quality Manager
    - Seamer Technicians
    - Process Engineers
  triggers:
    - New seam sample uploaded
    - SPC rule violation on seam height/overlap
    - Changeover/first-off verification
  inputs:
    - 'Micrometer readings (seam height, countersink)'
    - 'Seam teardown: BHL, CHL, overlap %, free space, tightness'
    - Cross-section images from saw/polisher
    - SKU-specific seam specs and tolerances
  steps:
    - 1) Parse measurements and perform spec checks
    - 2) CV on cross-sections to estimate dimensions (if provided)
    - '3) Map deviations to likely causes (e.g., 1st/2nd op roll, lifter)'
    - 4) Output actionable setup sheet and push to SPC database
  tools:
    - OpenCV/Detectron2
    - Custom rules engine
    - SPC DB (SQL)
    - Secure file storage (SharePoint/S3)
  outputs:
    - Pass/fail report with deviations
    - 'Recommended adjustments (e.g., 1st op roll +0.02 mm)'
    - Annotated cross-section images
    - SPC update and audit trail
  pricingModel:
    - Setup (model calibration per plant)
    - Per-station/month license
    - Optional per-analysis fee
  humanInLoop: true
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 9
    modelCapability: 8.5
    overall: 8.8
  risks:
    - Image quality and calibration drift
    - Spec/version control errors
    - Liability for incorrect recommendations
  dependencies:
    - Reference samples for calibration
    - Spec library by SKU
    - Upload workflow from lab/technicians

  problem:
    - >-
      Manual/semi-automated double seam inspection is slow and skills-dependent;
      interpreting micrometer/teardown data and cross-section images requires
      scarce experts, leading to inconsistent decisions across shifts and sites.
    - >-
      Root-cause to adjustment mapping (e.g., which roll/chuck/lifter to tweak
      and by how much) is tribal knowledge; new mechanics take months to reach
      proficiency, increasing downtime during changeovers and after jams.
    - >-
      Existing systems report measurements and pass/fail but rarely give
      precise, seamer-head–specific corrective actions; trend drift across
      heads/material lots often goes unnoticed until defects spike.
    - >-
      High-speed lines magnify losses: a 2,000 CPM line wastes ~20,000 cans for
      every 10 minutes of seam-related stoppage; leak/contamination risks create
      costly complaints and audits.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (paper logs, spreadsheets, standalone gauges) undermines
      SPC, audit readiness, and corporate rollups; plants struggle to compare
      performance across seamers, heads, and materials.
    - >-
      Material and tooling variability (end curl, coatings, chuck wear, roll
      geometry) requires continuous tuning; without predictive guidance,
      preventive maintenance is time-based rather than condition-based.
  solution:
    - >-
      Computer vision on cross-section images to auto-extract seam dimensions
      (body hook, cover hook, overlap, tightness, wrinkle score, seam
      thickness/length) with calibrated scale and lighting.
    - >-
      Sensor fusion: combine image-derived dimensions with micrometer/teardown
      measurements and countersink readings to boost accuracy and confidence
      scoring.
    - >-
      Actionable guidance engine: maps observed deviations to seamer-specific
      adjustments (e.g., 1st-op roll axial +/- 0.02 mm, roll-to-chuck clearance
      change, lifter pressure setting) per head and per product spec.
    - >-
      SPC and drift detection: real-time head-to-head and lot-to-lot trending
      with alerts when process capability (Cpk) degrades or when measurement
      variance indicates wear.
    - >-
      Playbooks and SOPs: guided checklists by model/material; changeover
      wizards reduce setup time; embedded knowledge base for defect signatures.
    - >-
      Integration: APIs to gauge vendors, QA systems, CMMS/ERP; optional PLC
      gateway for read/confirm adjustments; photo + measurement e-records with
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Deployment options: on-prem edge device for low-latency/air-gapped plants,
      cloud sync for fleet analytics; offline-first with batch upload.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Convert seam micrometer/teardown data and cross-section images into precise,
    head-level adjustment recommendations in minutes—standardizing best-practice
    seaming, reducing downtime, and cutting seam defects with audit-ready SPC
    across plants.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, multi-OEM dataset pairing images, measurements, and confirmed
    adjustments—difficult to replicate—combined with a guidance engine that
    translates QA findings into precise head-level actions. OEM/QA vendor
    integrations and calibration hardware create a defensible end-to-end
    workflow competitors lack.

  problem:
    - Manual checks miss early drift; defects surface after pallets are filled
    - Operators see out-of-spec numbers but not the root cause or fix

    - 'Seamer setup is trial-and-error, wasting time and product'
    - Inconsistent seams across lines drive claims and rework
    - Audit prep is painful; SPC trending is manual

    - Upload micrometer and teardown measurements plus cross-section images
    - AI correlates numbers and pixels to classify defects and severity
    - Get precise first-op and second-op roll and chuck recommendations
