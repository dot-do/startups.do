  problem:
    - >-
      High scrap/rework due to tear-out, washboarding, snipe, burn, and chatter
      when species, moisture content, and knife/blade condition vary (typical
      2–6% yield loss in planing/resawing lines).
    - >-
      Slow, inconsistent setups dependent on tribal knowledge; 15–45 minutes per
      changeover with frequent trial-and-error.
    - >-
      Premature tool wear and unplanned downtime (knife/blade costs $0.80–$2.50
      per 1,000 board feet; changeouts create 30–90 minutes of downtime).
    - >-
      Quality variability against finish targets (e.g., RA/RZ, scanner-based
      surface grade), causing secondary sanding or reprocessing.
    - >-
      Operator turnover and skill gaps leading to process drift and safety risks
      from incorrect pressure/feed settings.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated guidance across OEMs/tools; settings live in
      spreadsheets, manuals, or operator memory with poor version control.
  solution:
    - >-
      Setup recommender: feed rate, depth-of-cut per pass, knife/blade profile
      and hook/TPIs, bed/hold-down pressure, chipload, and pass count based on
      species, MC%, target thickness, and finish spec.
    - >-
      Multi-pass plan generator to meet removal targets with minimum tear-out
      and power spikes; flags unsafe or machine-limited combinations.
    - >-
      Tooling intelligence: recommends knife steel/coating, blade type, grind
      angle, and changeout threshold based on material abrasiveness and previous
      wear data.
    - >-
      Adaptive guidance: optional use of in-line sensors (moisture meters,
      spindle power, vibration/acoustic signatures, temperature) to refine
      recommendations and detect chatter/tear-out onset.
    - >-
      Digital recipe management: per machine, species, moisture band, and finish
      class; one-click recall, versioning, and traceable deviations.
    - >-
      Quality loop: capture first-pass yield, surface roughness proxies, and
      rework causes; auto-learns optimal settings by plant/tooling/state
      conditions.
    - >-
      Integrations: upload/download parameters to supported controls; APIs for
      MES/ERP/LIMS; import species/MC from scanners or manual entry.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance checks: force envelope and pressure bounds, minimum
      knife protrusion, guarding reminders; locked parameters for junior
      operators.
    - >-
      Training and SOPs: operator-facing visuals for pressure shoe placement,
      feed roll staging, and knife projection with shop-specific photos.
    - >-
      Offline-first mobile/tablet app with QR code machine selection and
      bilingual operator modes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, species- and moisture-aware setup recommendations that cut scrap
    20–40%, speed changeovers 25–50%, and lift throughput 5–15%—validated on
    your machines, tools, and finish targets. Cross-OEM, data-logging, and
    closed-loop learning turn tribal knowledge into repeatable digital recipes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-OEM, closed-loop dataset linking species, moisture, and tool geometry
    to quantified outcomes—continuously improved via on-line feedback—and the
    ability to push safe, guardrailed parameters directly to diverse
    controllers. Early partnerships and validated case studies compound
    defensibility.
