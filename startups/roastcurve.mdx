  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent roast quality (color/moisture/defects) across batches and
      shifts leads to 3–8% rework/scrap and customer complaints.
    - >-
      Manual tuning of time–temperature–airflow profiles is slow and
      tribal-knowledge driven; process drift from raw nut variability (size,
      oil, moisture) creates instability.
    - >-
      Energy consumption per kg is higher than necessary due to conservative
      setpoints and over-roasting safety margins (typical 8–20% avoidable
      gas/electric use).
    - >-
      Lab feedback on moisture/color is delayed (10–45 minutes), causing long
      correction loops and off-target production.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into which inputs (bean/nut lot, ambient conditions,
      line speed) drive defects; lack of predictive controls to prevent
      downgrades.
    - >-
      Existing OEM controls provide PID/recipes but not predictive quality or
      multi-variable optimization under constraints.
    - >-
      Scaling best-practice roast profiles across lines/sites is hard; inability
      to quantify ROI from changes stalls continuous improvement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Build a data-driven surrogate model that maps controllable variables
      (inlet/outlet temp, air velocity, drum speed, line speed, bed depth) and
      disturbances (incoming moisture, nut size, oil content, ambient
      conditions) to quality outputs (moisture %, L*a*b* color, breakage/scorch,
      oil separation risk).
    - >-
      Provide an optimizer that recommends setpoints per SKU/lot to hit target
      quality bands at minimum energy and within process constraints (safety,
      allergen, equipment limits).
    - >-
      Enable real-time predictive dashboards and alerts: predicted
      moisture/color at end of roast, probability of defects, energy per kg,
      with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Deliver an experimentation engine (small DOE) to efficiently improve the
      model with minimal disruption; A/B run compare to quantify ROI.
    - >-
      Integrate with PLC/SCADA/MES/LIMS for automatic data ingestion, advisory
      setpoint guidance, and optional closed-loop control (with
      human-in-the-loop).
    - >-
      Offer audit-ready batch records and electronic COA predictions to support
      FSMA, BRCGS, SQF documentation.
    - >-
      Provide a simulation sandbox (“digital twin”) to test new recipes, raw
      material shifts, and throughput scenarios before changing the line.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predictive, closed-loop roast optimization that links roast curves to
    moisture, color, and defect rates—reducing quality variance 30–50%, cutting
    energy 8–15%, and increasing FPY 10–20% within 8 weeks—all while integrating
    with existing roasters and QA workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-specific surrogate models and optimization workflows validated on
    nut/peanut butter lines, combined with OEM/integrator partnerships and
    benchmark datasets that enable accurate predictions with small DOEs and fast
    time-to-value; audit-ready quality records and energy ROI proofs create high
    switching costs.
