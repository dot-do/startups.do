  problem:
    - >-
      Undetected queenlessness leads to brood breaks of 7–21 days, reducing
      colony strength, honey yields, and pollination performance; manual checks
      often detect it too late.
    - >-
      Swarm preparation (queen cell building, piping/roaring acoustics) goes
      unnoticed between inspections, causing 10–30% seasonal colony splits and
      lost revenue.
    - >-
      Manual inspections are labor-intensive (5–10 min/hive) and intrusive,
      increasing stress and disease transmission and costing large operators
      100–300 labor hours per 1,000 hives per month in peak season.
    - >-
      Existing remote monitors (weight, temperature, humidity) don’t reliably
      indicate queen status or swarming prep; multi-sensor systems can be
      expensive with unclear ROI.
    - >-
      Migratory pollination contracts (e.g., almonds) penalize weak/queenless
      colonies; operators need early, objective signals to avoid penalties and
      truck rolls.
    - >-
      Data overload and false alarms from generic IoT solutions waste time;
      beekeepers need precise, actionable alerts tied to interventions (requeen,
      split management, feed/ventilation).
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge microphones in each hive capture acoustic signatures; on-device
      preprocessing reduces noise and bandwidth.
    - >-
      AI models trained on labeled hive acoustics detect queenless states,
      piping/roaring (swarm prep), ventilation stress/overheating, and agitation
      events.
    - >-
      Multi-hive mobile and web dashboards with heatmaps of risk, per-hive
      timelines, and intervention recommendations (requeen window, split timing,
      ventilation/feed prompts).
    - >-
      Connectivity via LoRaWAN (apiary gateway) or solar cellular hub for remote
      yards; offline buffering with delayed sync.
    - >-
      APIs and integrations with apiary management tools (e.g., HiveTracks) to
      auto-create tasks and logs.
    - >-
      Field-proven alerting via SMS, app push, or webhook with adjustable
      sensitivity and quiet hours.
    - >-
      Analytics: colony strength index, queenless-day counter, swarm risk index,
      intervention impact analysis.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuous, low-cost acoustic monitoring that detects queenlessness,
    swarming preparation, and stress 7–10 days earlier than manual inspections,
    reducing lost colony-days by 20–40%, cutting swarms by 15–25%, and lowering
    inspection labor by 30–50% through precise, actionable alerts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, seasonally and geographically diverse labeled acoustic dataset
    tied to verified colony states—difficult and time-consuming for new entrants
    to replicate—combined with edge-optimized models that run on ultra-low-cost
    hardware, validated through multi-season pilots with leading migratory
    operators and growers.
