leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual BOM extraction from PDFs/CAD drawings and specs is slow (1–3 weeks
      per project) and error‑prone, causing rework and delayed quotes.
    - >-
      Inconsistent part naming and lack of a marine-specific taxonomy lead to
      misbuys, duplicate items, and inventory bloat (2–5% material cost
      overruns).
    - >-
      Supply volatility and opaque lead times derail production schedules;
      procurement lacks reliable alternates when items are out of stock or long
      lead.
    - >-
      Cost roll-ups across hull, electrical, mechanical, and interiors are
      fragmented, making it hard to produce accurate, timely estimates and
      competitive bids.
    - >-
      Smaller yards often work from mixed sources (PDFs, legacy CAD,
      spreadsheets) that don’t integrate with ERP/PLM, creating data silos.
    - >-
      Compliance requirements (ABYC/USCG/ISO) and weight/space constraints
      aren’t linked to BOM choices, increasing risk of non-compliance or rework.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload PDFs, 2D drawings, 3D CAD exports (BOM tables, parts lists),
      spreadsheets; auto-extract line items with quantities, specs, and
      attributes.
    - >-
      Normalize items to a marine taxonomy (materials, fasteners, electrical,
      plumbing, paints, hardware, engines) with synonym and standards mapping
      (ABYC/USCG/ISO references).
    - >-
      Live pricing and stock/lead-time from integrated marine distributors and
      OEMs; multi-supplier quotes per item.
    - >-
      Alternate recommendations with compatibility rules (spec equivalence,
      footprint, standards) and cross-grade options.
    - >-
      Project cost roll-up with labor factors, markups, currency, and what-if
      scenarios; track by assembly/system and revision.
    - >-
      Lead-time risk scoring and schedule impact; phase-aware procurement
      recommendations.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to ERP/PLM (Dynamics 365, SAP B1, IFS), procurement
      (Ariba), and CAD/PDM (SolidWorks, Rhino/Orca3D, ShipConstructor CSV).
    - >-
      Compliance and weight metadata per line; flag items impacting stability,
      electrical loads, or standards.
    - >-
      Collaboration: review/approve workflow, change tracking, audit trail, and
      export to PO/quote formats.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From drawings/specs to a normalized, priced, lead-time BOM with approved
    alternates in hours, not weeks—purpose-built for marine with compliance- and
    weight-aware intelligence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A marine-specific data moat: proprietary synonym/compatibility graph and
    alternates library derived from thousands of BOMs and closed-loop outcomes
    (pricing, stock, lead times, and post-install success), reinforced by
    distributor/OEM partnerships and workflow integrations that are costly for
    generalist tools to replicate.
