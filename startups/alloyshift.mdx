  problem:
    - >-
      Furnace preheat and soak cycles are set conservatively to protect
      metallurgical properties, wasting 8–20% energy per ton versus what’s
      needed for the current load, alloy, and furnace condition.
    - >-
      Plants face rising peak demand charges (often 30–60% of the electric bill)
      and lack tools to shift flexible heat loads without jeopardizing
      throughput or quality.
    - >-
      Schedulers and operators don’t have real-time visibility into tariff
      windows, DR events, or the cost impact of setpoint choices; coordination
      across production, maintenance, and energy is manual and error-prone.
    - >-
      Existing EMS/SCADA systems measure energy but do not optimize cycle ramps,
      soak durations, or queue timing within metallurgical guardrails.
    - >-
      Quality and compliance constraints (Nadcap/AS9100/AMS specs) make
      engineers wary of changes; any optimization must provably stay within
      validated process windows and pass audits.
    - >-
      Furnace performance drifts with refractory condition, load patterns, and
      ambient conditions; static recipes do not adapt, increasing scrap risk and
      energy waste.
    - >-
      Utilities offer DR incentives for curtailable load, but metals facilities
      underperform or opt-out due to risk to product properties and delivery
      commitments.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI setpoint advisor that adjusts preheat/soak ramps and holds within
      validated metallurgical envelopes per alloy, load mass, and furnace
      condition.
    - >-
      Production scheduler that aligns furnace queues with TOU/RTP tariffs and
      DR events, recommending when to stage, start, or pause loads to minimize
      cost while meeting due dates.
    - >-
      Digital twin of furnaces combining thermal models with data-driven
      performance estimation to predict time-to-temp, uniformity, and property
      outcomes (e.g., grain size, hardness) with confidence intervals.
    - >-
      Tariff and DR engine that ingests day-ahead/real-time prices and DR
      dispatch signals; computes marginal cost per cycle and prescribes
      actionable curtailment or shifting plans.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration to PLC/SCADA (OPC UA/Modbus) with
      operator-in-the-loop overrides and automated M&V to prove savings and
      compliance for audits (Nadcap/AS9100).
    - >-
      Quality guardrails tied to LIMS specs and recipe management; the system
      will not recommend settings outside approved windows and logs rationale
      for every change.
    - >-
      What-if simulation for process engineers to evaluate new ramps, refractory
      changes, or maintenance plans before deploying to production.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Spec-safe AI that reduces furnace energy intensity 10–15%, cuts peak kW
    8–20%, and earns DR revenue—without compromising metallurgical properties or
    throughput—by optimizing preheat/soak ramps and scheduling loads against
    tariffs in real time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A validated, spec-safe optimization library for nonferrous alloys backed by
    QC-linked datasets and audit-ready change control, plus partnerships with
    furnace OEMs and DR aggregators that enable both safe control envelopes and
    monetized load flexibility. Competitors either lack metallurgical depth or
    lack integrated DR economics.
