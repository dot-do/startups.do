  problem:
    - >-
      Manual PLC/drive code reviews are slow (4–16 engineer-hours per machine)
      and error-prone, causing late FAT/SAT defects and rework.
    - >-
      Inconsistent naming standards and documentation make cross-team
      collaboration and troubleshooting difficult, especially across regions and
      vendors.
    - >-
      Safety interlocks and interdependencies (e.g., dry-run, overpressure,
      cavitation, CIP) are inconsistently implemented and verified, exposing
      OEMs to safety and warranty risk.
    - >-
      FAT/SAT test plans are recreated for each project from scratch, leading to
      gaps in test coverage and duplication of effort.
    - >-
      Multi-vendor ecosystems (Rockwell, Siemens, Beckhoff, Omron; ABB, Siemens,
      Rockwell, Danfoss, Yaskawa drives) hinder standardized review and
      validation.
    - >-
      Regulatory and customer audits (GAMP 5, ISO 13849, IEC 60204-1, corporate
      standards) demand traceability that most teams cannot produce quickly.
    - >-
      Late-stage defects increase project lead time (by 1–3 weeks on average)
      and cost (5–10% margin erosion on affected projects).
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest PLC projects and drive parameter sets from major vendors; perform
      static analysis for naming conventions, safety interlocks, state logic,
      alarms, and testability.
    - >-
      Map findings to industry standards and corporate guidelines (e.g., ISA-5.1
      tag naming, PackML/ISA-88, ISO 13849, IEC 60204-1) with traceable
      evidence.
    - >-
      Auto-generate structured FAT/SAT test steps and checklists
      (CSV/Excel/Word) with tag references, expected results, and coverage
      metrics.
    - >-
      Provide risk scoring highlighting critical interlock gaps (e.g., run-dry
      detection, overpressure, overtemp, motor overload, torque/speed limits).
    - >-
      Drive parameter review against templates (e.g., torque limits, accel/decel
      ramps, stall detection, safe torque off wiring) and alignment with PLC
      logic.
    - >-
      Cross-vendor project compare and change impact analysis to update test
      plans after code changes.
    - >-
      APIs and plug-ins for TIA Portal, Studio 5000, TwinCAT, Omron Sysmac, and
      popular version control tools (e.g., Auvesy-MDT/Octoplant).
    - >-
      Optional emulation hooks for test execution assist (PLCSIM Advanced, Logix
      Emulate, TwinCAT simulation) to dry-run key sequences.
    - >-
      On-premise and private cloud deployment with secure artifact handling and
      audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut FAT/SAT defects and review time by 50% with automated, standards-aware
    PLC/drive static analysis and one-click, coverage-driven FAT/SAT test plan
    generation tailored to pumping equipment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A deep, pumping-equipment-specific rules library and coverage engine trained
    on diverse vendor ecosystems, combined with one-click FAT/SAT generation and
    compliance mapping. Early partnerships and validated benchmarks create high
    switching costs and credibility versus generic code scanners or manual
    checklists.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Automation and quality leaders at pump OEMs, skid builders, and integrators
    who must ship safe, compliant PLC/drive logic on schedule.
  problem: >-
    - External: Multi-vendor PLC/drive projects create inconsistent naming,
    parameter drift, and untested safety paths.

    - Internal: Fear of missed edge cases, audit gaps, and late-stage rework;
    limited time for deep peer reviews.

    - Philosophical: Critical pumping systems should never reach the field
    without transparent, verifiable test coverage.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the pressure of FAT rooms and ship dates—you need
    confidence before power-up.

    - Authority: 10+ years in fluid-handling automation; IEC 61131-3 and safety
    interlock expertise; proven static analyzers and templates used across OEM
    programs.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload PLC projects, drive parameter exports, and URS/IO list via secure
    portal.

    2) Get a gap report: naming compliance, interlock completeness, and
    test-coverage map; review in a short workshop.

    3) Auto-generate FAT/SAT steps with traceability; export to Word/Excel/Jira
    and finalize sign-off.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a pilot review on one skid or line. Secondary: Request a
    sample gap report and test plan.
  success: >-
    - Consistent code and parameter standards across platforms.

    - Documented, verified safety interlocks (E-Stop, STO, dry-run,
    overpressure).

    - Complete, reusable FAT/SAT packs with URS traceability.

    - Fewer defects, faster commissioning, smoother audits.

    - Higher customer confidence and quicker revenue recognition.
  failure: |-
    - Missed interlocks and unsafe states surfacing during FAT/SAT.
    - Costly rework, delays, and failed audits.
    - Unplanned downtime and warranty exposure.
    - Fragmented tests and tribal knowledge persisting across teams.

    subtitle: >-
      Static PLC and drive parameter analysis with auto-generated FAT/SAT for
      metering, dosing, and pumping equipment. Catch naming, safety, and
      coverage issues before build and ship with audit-ready docs.
    ctaText: Request a demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Late logic issues found during FAT cause costly rework and delays.
    - Inconsistent tag naming across skids and lines erodes reuse.
    - Safety interlocks and safe states are hard to verify comprehensively.
    - Drive parameter sets drift from standards and create field failures.
    - Manual FAT/SAT plans miss edge cases and lack traceability.
    - Compliance documentation is slow and error-prone.
    - Expert knowledge is tribal; reviews are not repeatable.
  solution:
    - Automated static review of PLC programs and drive parameter sets.
    - >-
      Enforce naming and design standards for pumps, valves, meters, and dosing
      skids.
    - 'Verify safety interlocks, fault handling, and safe-state transitions.'
    - 'Quantify test coverage across I/O, alarms, sequences, and modes.'
    - Auto-generate FAT/SAT steps with expected results and pass/fail criteria.
    - Produce audit-ready packages and change-impact reports.
  features:
    - >-
      PLC parsing for Ladder/FBD/Structured Text; cross-project tag dictionary
      checks.

      steps.
    - >-
      Change impact: diff between program/parameter revisions and auto-update of
      affected tests.
    - >-
      Export to your templates: Word/PDF/CSV/JSON; evidence placeholders and
      sign-off fields.
    - 'Integrations: source control and ticketing via simple APIs.'
    - >-
      On-prem or private cloud; offline mode; no source code leaves your
      network.
    - >-
      Domain presets for metering, batching, dispensing, and CIP rinse/flush
      sequences.
  steps:
    - Upload PLC program and drive parameter files (or connect to your repo).
    - 'Select standards and rulesets (naming, safety, coverage targets).'
    - Run static analysis and review prioritized findings with suggested fixes.
    - Generate FAT/SAT test plans; tailor steps and acceptance criteria.
    - Export documents and issues; assign owners and due dates.
    - Re-run on revisions to track closure and maintain coverage.
