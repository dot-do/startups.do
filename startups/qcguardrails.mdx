leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual QC review of instrument outputs (chromatography, mass spec, ICP,
      PCR, ELISA, etc.) consumes 20–40% of analyst time per batch, delaying
      turnaround by 0.5–2 days.
    - >-
      Inconsistent application of QC rules (blanks, LCS/MS/MSD spikes,
      duplicates, control charts) leads to 1–3% release errors and frequent
      rework, risking client dissatisfaction and regulatory findings.
    - >-
      Heterogeneous instrument ecosystems (Agilent, Waters, Thermo, Shimadzu,
      PerkinElmer, Sciex) produce varied file formats that are hard to
      standardize and integrate into LIMS/ELN workflows.
    - >-
      QA documentation burden for ISO 17025/GxP requires auditable,
      version-controlled QC logic, but most labs rely on Excel/R scripts with
      limited traceability and change control.
    - >-
      Scaling sample volume (seasonal spikes, new contracts) is constrained by
      QA throughput, not instrument time; adding analysts is costly and
      onboarding takes months.
    - >-
      Regulated environments need 21 CFR Part 11-compliant e-signatures, audit
      trails, and validation packages; building and maintaining this in-house is
      expensive and risky.
    - >-
      Control charting and trend monitoring are reactive; labs often miss drift
      until OOS events occur, leading to CAPA investigations and potential
      invalidations.
    - >-
      Clients increasingly demand structured release packages (PDF + EDD like
      SEDD/EQuIS), but compiling them manually is error-prone and slow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse native instrument outputs and exports (CSV, XML, TXT, vendor result
      sets) into a normalized schema with method- and instrument-aware metadata.
    - >-
      Apply a configurable QC rules engine: blanks/field blanks, LCS/MS/MSD
      recoveries, RPDs, calibration/verification checks, Levey-Jennings control
      charts, and Westgard-like rules for applicable assays.
    - >-
      Layer anomaly detection to catch pattern-based issues (baseline drift,
      integration anomalies, carryover, detector saturation, retention time
      shifts) with tunable sensitivity and explainable flags.
    - >-
      Compute batch-level risk scores and determine auto-release eligibility
      under preapproved guardrails; route exceptions to human reviewers with
      prioritized queues.
    - >-
      Generate complete release packages: PDF report with QC summary, audit
      trails, raw/derived data lineage; machine-readable EDDs (e.g., SEDD 5.x,
      EQuIS EDD, XML/JSON) tailored to client/regulator requirements.
    - >-
      Integrate with LIMS/ELN (webhooks, REST APIs, file drops) to pull sample
      metadata and push pass/fail status, CoAs, and final reports; support
      e-signatures and version control for rule sets.
    - >-
      Provide continuous control charting by analyte/instrument/method; alert on
      trends (EWMA/CUSUM) and recommend preventive maintenance or recalibration
      windows.
    - >-
      Offer deployment options: validated private cloud (single-tenant VPC) or
      on-premise for air-gapped GxP/regulated sites, with full CSV/Part 11
      documentation packages.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Instrument-agnostic, auditable AI QC engine that applies standardized,
    validated guardrails to laboratory data, cutting review time 30–50%,
    reducing release errors to <0.5%, and safely auto-releasing compliant
    batches with full 21 CFR Part 11/ISO 17025 traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-instrument, cross-method labeled dataset of QC outcomes and
    anomalies (sourced via design partners) powering explainable models; a
    validated, standards-mapped QC rule library with versioned change control;
    and prebuilt, vendor-acknowledged adapters and LIMS integrations that
    compress time-to-value and reduce validation burden. Early SOC 2/Part 11
    alignment and audit-ready documentation make replacement by in-house scripts
    or generic tools unattractive.

  character: >-
    QA/QC manager at a testing laboratory who must release accurate results
    fast, prove compliance, and scale without adding headcount.
  problem: >-
    External: Disparate instrument outputs; manual QC of blanks, spikes,
    duplicates, and control charts; spreadsheet wrangling; slow, error-prone
    reviews; audit exposure. Internal: Fear of missing anomalies; burnout from
    after-hours checks; frustration with brittle scripts and inconsistent
    decisions. Philosophical: Scientists should focus on science—data quality
    should be systematic, consistent, and auditable, not dependent on heroics.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: Built by former lab analysts who know batch reviews, hold times,
    and audit pressure. Authority: Validated QC engine and rule library aligned
    with ISO 17025 and 21 CFR Part 11–ready workflows; proven instrument/LIMS
    integrations; full audit trails and e-signatures.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect instruments and LIMS; 2) Configure QC rules or
    import your SOPs (blanks, spikes, duplicates, control charts); 3) Auto-QC
    every batch—review only flagged exceptions—then generate a release package
    with audit trail. Agreement plan: Start with a secure, read-only pilot on
    your data; fixed-fee onboarding and success criteria; SOC 2, SSO, and
    role-based access.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a demo; Start a 30-day pilot on your own data. Transitional:
    Download the QC rules template and sample release package; get an ROI
    estimate.
  success: >-
    Majority of routine batches auto-release within guardrails; faster
    turnaround and higher throughput; fewer nonconformances; effortless audit
    responses with complete traceability; real-time control charts across
    instruments and methods; happier analysts who reclaim nights and weekends;
    scales as volume grows.
  failure: >-
    Manual reviews remain the bottleneck; anomalies slip through, causing
    rework, client complaints, or recalls; inconsistent QC calls and fragile
    scripts break with instrument updates; audit findings, lost trust, revenue
    leakage, and staff turnover.
