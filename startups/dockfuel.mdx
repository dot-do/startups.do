  problem:
    - >-
      Fuel stockouts during peak weekends/events cause lost sales and
      reputational damage; many marinas experience 1–4 stockouts per season.
    - >-
      Over-ordering ties up cash and risks wet-stock losses; typical safety
      stock is set arbitrarily (e.g., “half a tank”), leading to 10–25% excess
      inventory on average.
    - >-
      Delivery lead times and minimum drop sizes (2,500–8,000 gal) are hard to
      balance against tank constraints and demand spikes.
    - >-
      Staffing at fuel docks is poorly matched to demand; overtime and idle time
      can add 10–20% to labor costs and create long customer wait times.
    - >-
      Manual forecasting via spreadsheets or supplier guesswork ignores key
      local drivers (weather, tides, holidays, fishing tournaments, regattas,
      transient traffic).
    - >-
      Limited visibility of price windows (e.g., OPIS rack changes) results in
      suboptimal reorder timing and erodes gross margin by 2–6¢/gal.
    - >-
      Fragmented systems (POS, tank sensors, reservation platforms) make data
      consolidation and forecasting difficult for small operations.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI demand forecasting using POS dispenses, tank telemetry, AIS vessel
      traffic, weather/tide forecasts, holidays/events, and historical patterns
      (hourly/daily/weekly horizons).
    - >-
      Inventory and reorder optimizer that accounts for tank capacities, min/max
      drops, supplier lead times, delivery windows, and rack price signals to
      recommend “order by” dates and quantities.
    - >-
      Labor recommender that outputs hourly staffing schedules for fuel dock
      attendants based on predicted fueling transactions and service-time
      distributions.
    - >-
      Alerts and workflows: low days-of-cover, price window opportunities,
      delivery delays, and event-triggered demand spikes.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate regattas, storms, or supply delays;
      stress-test reorder plans and labor schedules.
    - >-
      Multi-site dashboard with KPIs, audit trails, and export to
      suppliers/schedulers (CSV/API).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Marina-specific AI that forecasts fuel demand, optimizes reorder
    timing/quantities, and right-sizes fuel dock staffing—reducing stockouts and
    labor waste while lifting fuel margin and customer satisfaction.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Marina-specific feature engineering that fuses AIS vessel traffic within
    local catchment, tide/visibility/wind effects, and event calendars—plus
    early distributor/POS integrations—creating a proprietary data moat and
    superior forecast accuracy vs generic inventory tools.
