leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Legacy specifications in Word/PDF/PowerPoint/Visio/DOORS modules are
      unstructured, duplicated, and inconsistent, making SysML model creation
      slow and error-prone
    - >-
      Manual conversion to an initial SysML model typically takes 4–9 months and
      $250k–$600k in engineering labor per program
    - >-
      Certification and safety standards (ARP4754A, ARP4761, DO-178C/DO-254,
      DO-160, MIL-STD-961, MIL-STD-882) require verifiable requirements
      traceability that is difficult to establish post hoc
    - >-
      Interface definitions across suppliers are fragmented, causing late
      integration defects and costly rework
    - >-
      Aging workforce and supplier churn risk knowledge loss; design intent is
      buried in documents rather than captured in models
    - >-
      MBSE tooling exists (Cameo, Capella, Rhapsody, Polarion/DOORS) but there
      is no fast, accurate bridge from legacy specs to a baseline SysML model
      with trace
    - >-
      Security and compliance (ITAR/EAR/CMMC) often preclude cloud-only AI
      solutions; teams need on-prem/air-gapped options
    - >-
      Program schedules demand digital thread artifacts early (SRR/SDR/PDR
      milestones); delays in seeding models jeopardize reviews and contract
      incentives
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted pipeline to parse legacy docs (Word, PDF, DOORS/ReqIF,
      Polarion, Excel) and produce a seed SysML model (blocks, interfaces,
      states, requirements) with source traceability
    - >-
      Hybrid NLP/LLM + domain rules and ontologies tuned for search, detection,
      navigation, guidance, aeronautical and nautical systems
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop curation workflow to review, accept, or adjust extracted
      elements with full audit logs
    - >-
      Exports to Cameo (MagicDraw), Capella, Rhapsody via XMI/MDXML and
      bidirectional ReqIF for requirements tools (DOORS/Polarion/Jama)
    - >-
      Compliance accelerators: templates and mappings for ARP4754A, ARP4761,
      DO-178C/DO-254 artifacts and DOORS trace matrices
    - >-
      Secure deployments: on-prem Kubernetes package (air-gapped) and
      FedRAMP/Azure Government options; no customer data used for model training
      by default
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Kickstart a compliant SysML model from legacy specs in weeks, not
    months—90%+ precision requirement extraction with provable trace to sources,
    deployable on-prem (air-gapped) or GovCloud, cutting initial modeling cost
    and schedule by 50–70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Aerospace-tuned extraction models and ontologies validated on real program
    corpora, combined with on-prem/air-gapped deployment and certification-ready
    trace evidence—reducing both technical and compliance risk in ways generic
    AI or manual MBSE services cannot.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Systems engineering lead at a NAICS 334511 manufacturer who must modernize
    from document-centric development to MBSE without losing traceability or
    schedule.
  problem: >-
    Legacy specs live in scattered PDFs and Word files, causing ambiguity,
    rework, and audit risk; MBSE adoption stalls because starting from a blank
    SysML model is slow, error‑prone, and hard to justify amid tight milestones.
  guide: >-
    Doc-to-SysML Extractor is your AI-assisted MBSE kickstart; we understand
    regulated aerospace/defense programs and supplier chains, and we’ve
    delivered clean extractions for radar, avionics, and navigation systems with
    secure handling and toolchain integration (Cameo/Rhapsody +
    DOORS/Polarion/Jama).
  plan: >-
    1) Assess: 60–90 min discovery and sample docs to define scope and target
    tool. 2) Extract: convert specs into SysML requirements, blocks, interfaces,
    and states with paragraph-level trace links. 3) Validate & handoff: joint
    review, corrections applied, model loaded into your repository with
    quick-start training.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a discovery call and submit a sample spec for a fixed-price pilot
    extraction.
  success: >-
    A trusted seed SysML model with end-to-end traceability: clearer
    requirements, defined interfaces and behaviors, faster flowdown, smoother
    IV&V, compliance-ready baselines, and accelerated PDR/CDR.
  failure: >-
    Remain stuck in document churn: missed or duplicated requirements, brittle
    interfaces, late integration defects, expensive change impacts, audit
    findings, and stalled MBSE adoption.

    - >-
      Manual decomposition into requirements, blocks, and interfaces takes
      weeks.

    - >-
      AI mines requirements, interfaces, states, and parameters from legacy
      documents.

      stereotypes.
    - 'State/mode machine synthesis from mode tables, sequences, and narratives.'
    - >-
      Parameter and units normalization; coordinate frames (e.g., WGS‑84,

      Auto-generated traceability matrices (Req↔Req, Req↔Block, Req↔Interface)
      with change impact.

      Generate the SysML project: packages for Requirements, Blocks, Interfaces,
      States, and diagrams.
    - >-
      Export via XMI/ReqIF or sync to your toolchain; assign owners and start
      elaboration.
    - >-
      Iterate as documents evolve—re-run extraction and preserve trace across
      versions.
