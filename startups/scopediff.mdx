  problem:
    - >-
      Change events and change orders (COs) are frequent in
      commercial/institutional projects (typically 6–12% of contract value) but
      labor-intensive to quantify and price, leading to leakage of recoverable
      costs and schedule impacts.
    - >-
      Revised drawings/specs, RFIs, ASIs, and addenda are compared manually or
      with basic overlays; quantity deltas and scope shifts are often missed or
      double-counted.
    - >-
      Pricing benchmarks are inconsistent across regions, trades, and union
      conditions, causing over/under-pricing and contentious negotiations.
    - >-
      CO language is drafted ad hoc, increasing risk of ambiguous scope, missing
      back-up, and delayed approval cycles.
    - >-
      Project teams spend 6–12 hours per CO across PE/estimator/PM roles, with
      approval cycle times of 2–6 weeks; disputes erode relationships and cash
      flow.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated document diff: ingest drawings, specs, RFIs, ASIs, addenda;
      detect text and graphical changes vs baseline (sheet-to-sheet and spec
      section deltas).
    - >-
      Quantity delta engine: compute net changes by CSI division/trade; link to
      assemblies and cost codes; produce auditable takeoff snapshots and
      citations.
    - >-
      Price check: benchmark labor/material/equipment using region- and
      union-aware indices (e.g., RSMeans/Gordian, Davis-Bacon, local wage
      agreements) and recent internal project history.
    - >-
      CO drafting: generate clear scope narratives, inclusions/exclusions, time
      impact rationale, and backup exhibits with citations to changed
      sheets/sections.
    - >-
      Negotiation package: side-by-side comparison of proposed vs benchmark
      cost, sensitivity ranges, and suggested negotiation language/clauses.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: push/pull change events, budget line items, and
      attachments to Procore Cost Management and Autodesk Build; export to
      PDF/Excel; API for ERPs (CMiC/Viewpoint).
    - >-
      Audit trail and compliance: traceability from each price line to source
      delta and cost assumption; SOC 2 and project data residency controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that diffs revised docs vs baseline, quantifies scope deltas, benchmarks
    pricing to market, and drafts legally sound CO language—cutting prep time by
    70–85%, improving capture rate by 2–5% of CO value, and reducing approval
    cycle time by 30–50%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Compound data advantage: aggregated, permissioned dataset of doc deltas,
    quantity changes, negotiated CO outcomes, and final agreed pricing by
    region/trade fuels continuously improving benchmarks and clause
    suggestions—paired with deep integrations into Procore/ACC that reduce
    switching costs and create workflow lock-in.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Construction project leads (GCs, CMs, owner reps, estimators) who need fast,
    fair, defensible change orders.
  problem: >-
    - External: Constant design/spec revisions create hidden scope deltas and
    pricing ambiguity.

    - Internal: You worry about missing scope, overpaying or underbilling, and
    losing nights reconciling markups.

    - Philosophical: Change orders should be transparent, data-driven, and
    negotiated on facts—not friction.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We’ve lived the chaos of late design changes and tense CO
    negotiations.

    - Authority: Our AI pinpoints scope deltas, benchmarks pricing, and drafts
    precise CO language with auditable backup. Private by default; your data
    stays yours; encryption and human-in-the-loop options.
  plan: >-
    - Process Plan: 1) Upload baseline and revised docs (drawings/specs/BOQs).
    2) We detect and quantify scope changes; flag risks; price-check line items.
    3) Export draft CO language, itemized backup, and negotiation points.

    - Agreement Plan: Clear pricing, secure workflow, and a pilot to prove value
    before scale.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot on your next change event.

    - Transitional: Download a sample report and CO language pack; run a free
    scope-diff on one document set.
  success: >-
    - Faster: Turn CO reviews from days into hours.

    - Financial: Capture full entitlement, avoid overpayment, and protect
    margin.

    - Risk: Auditable diffs and benchmarks reduce disputes and claims.

    - Relationships: Build trust with clear, defensible documentation.
  failure: >-
    - Without it: Scope gaps slip through, you overpay or leave money on the
    table, COs stall, schedules slip, and disputes escalate under audit.
