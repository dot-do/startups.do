leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQ intake is fragmented across email, PDFs, spreadsheets, and STEP files,
      forcing estimators to re-key specs and BOM details (1–3 hours per RFQ).
    - >-
      Critical details (diameter, kerf, tooth count/geometry, rake angles, heat
      treatment, handle materials, forgings vs. stampings) are easily missed,
      creating quote errors and rework.
    - >-
      Quote turnaround time is slow (often 2–5 days), reducing win rates when
      buyers need same-day or next-day responses.
    - >-
      Cycle-time and material estimating rely on tribal knowledge; when senior
      estimators are unavailable, throughput drops and consistency suffers.
    - >-
      ERP/PLM/CPQ systems are not purpose-built for extracting manufacturing
      features from RFQs or STEP models, causing manual bridges and duplicate
      data entry.
    - >-
      Leaders lack visibility into quoting efficiency, win-rate attribution, and
      margin leakage caused by inaccurate routing or materials pricing.
    - >-
      Seasonal spikes overwhelm quoting teams; adding headcount is costly and
      training takes months.
    - >-
      OEM and distributor customers increasingly demand structured quotes with
      traceability and faster revisions, straining current processes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified RFQ ingestion: monitored inbox, portal upload, and EDI/API
      connectors; OCR for PDFs; STEP/IGES parser for geometry.
    - >-
      Domain extraction: blade diameter, kerf, tooth count/form, rake/clearance
      angles, bore, gullet profile, set pattern; hand-tool materials, forging
      vs. stamping, heat-treatment, coatings, handle materials.
    - >-
      Routing and cycle-time estimation: parameterized rules + ML models for
      grinding, brazing, laser/waterjet, heat-treat, coating, assembly,
      packaging; adjustable by plant capability.
    - >-
      Cost roll-up: materials (HSS, carbide tips, alloy steels, polymers),
      consumables (grinding wheels, brazing alloys), machine rates, labor
      grades, scrap/yield; live material indices optional.
    - >-
      Price recommendation: configurable margin floors/targets by customer
      segment, MOQ, and lead time; flags for strategic discounts.
    - >-
      Quote draft generation: standardized templates with line items,
      rev-controlled assumptions, and alternates; export to ERP/CPQ/CRM.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: side-by-side RFQ vs extracted spec, confidence
      scores, one-click corrections that retrain models.
    - >-
      Analytics: turnaround time, estimator throughput, accuracy (MAE vs
      actual), win-rate impact, margin variance; SLA dashboards.
    - >-
      Compliance & security: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO, data residency options, PII
      redaction, audit trails.
    - >-
      Change management: playbooks, estimator training, and ROI tracking with
      quarterly business reviews.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce RFQ-to-quote time by 60–80% with domain-trained AI that extracts
    saw-blade/hand-tool specs from PDFs/emails/STEP, auto-builds routings and
    costed BOMs, and drafts margin-guarded quotes that drop into your
    ERP—human-reviewed, auditable, and secure.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-trained extraction and costing engine purpose-built for saw blades
    and hand tools: geometry feature recognition for tooth forms, kerf,
    rake/clearance angles, and heat-treat parameters; pre-built routing and cost
    libraries for grinding/brazing/heat-treat/assembly; and ERP-grade
    integrations with auditability. Human-in-the-loop corrections continuously
    retrain private, tenant-scoped models—compounding accuracy that generic
    document AI or horizontal quoting tools cannot match.
