  problem:
    - >-
      Art dealers spend 5–20 minutes per artwork to clean images, normalize
      titles/medium/dimensions, and create listings, slowing time-to-list and
      sales velocity.
    - >-
      Inconsistent metadata (artist name variants, mixed units, missing
      provenance/condition) causes errors, returns, and platform rejections
      (e.g., Artsy, 1stDibs).
    - >-
      Backlogs build after fairs/consignments; small teams can’t scale
      cataloging throughput without adding headcount or interns.
    - >-
      Existing DAM/IMS tools store data but don’t automate intake from raw
      images/notes or produce marketplace-ready assets.
    - >-
      Copy/paste between inventory systems and marketplaces leads to duplicate
      work and data drift.
    - >-
      Quality issues (color fidelity, crops, glare, frames vs. image) reduce
      buyer confidence and CTR on listings.
    - >-
      Pricing and categorization are inconsistent; lack of authority control and
      structured vocabularies degrades search and discoverability.
    - >-
      Outsourcing is slow, variable-quality, and lacks integrations back to
      gallery systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or email-drop raw images, notes, PDFs, or screenshots; auto-ingest
      from watch folders and cloud drives.
    - >-
      AI pipeline extracts and standardizes title, artist, date, medium,
      support, dimensions, editioning, signatures/inscriptions, condition notes,
      provenance, literature, and exhibition history using OCR + vision + NLP
      tuned for art.
    - >-
      Authority control: normalize artist names via ULAN/Wikidata;
      medium/technique terms via AAT; locations via TGN; auto-flag ambiguities.
    - >-
      Image processing for listings: crop, background cleanup, de-skew, glare
      reduction suggestions, color-check guidance, multi-view set creation,
      watermarking, and size-optimized derivatives (web, marketplace, print
      sheet).
    - >-
      Schema mapping to IMS (Artlogic, Artwork Archive, GalleryManager,
      ArtBinder) and marketplaces (Artsy, 1stDibs, Artnet, LiveAuctioneers,
      Shopify/Woo) with field-level validation; one-click publish or export
      (CSV/JSON/XML).
    - >-
      Confidence scoring and exceptions queue for human review; optional pooled
      expert QC for critical fields.
    - >-
      Comps-assisted pricing suggestions (opt-in) using historical public
      results and marketplace norms; flags unrealistic asks.
    - >-
      Batch operations: deduplicate variants, merge notes, auto-translate
      listings (EN/FR/DE/ES/ZH/JP).
    - >-
      Turnaround SLA: under 4 hours standard, 30-minute rush for priority
      queues; detailed audit trail per record.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut artwork cataloging and listing prep from 10 minutes to under 60 seconds
    with AI that understands art metadata, delivers platform-compliant entries,
    and pushes them directly into your IMS and marketplaces with
    human-in-the-loop quality when needed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, art-specific AI trained on authority-controlled
    vocabularies and real dealer workflows, combined with deep integrations to
    IMS and marketplaces and a vetted registrar QC network—resulting in
    measurable listing acceptance and conversion improvements competitors can’t
    easily replicate.

    Art dealers, gallery managers, and secondary‑market brokers who need to turn
    raw images and scattered notes into consistent, listing‑ready catalog
    entries—fast, accurately, and at scale.
  problem: >-
    External: Intake chaos, inconsistent metadata, slow listing cycles, and
    error‑prone manual entry. Internal: Overwhelmed by backlog and worried about
    credibility and missed windows. Philosophical: Important works deserve
    accurate, professional presentation at market speed.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know intake days are messy and deadlines unforgiving. Authority:
    Our AI workflow aligns with cataloging best practices (CCO, Getty AAT, IPTC)
    and common marketplace schemas (e.g., Artsy, Artnet, 1stDibs, Shopify), with
    optional human‑in‑the‑loop QC.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Upload images/notes/COAs/invoices. 2) AI parses and normalizes
    data (artist, title, medium, dimensions, year, edition, provenance,
    condition), dedupes variants, standardizes filenames. 3) Enrich with alt
    text, keywords, classifications, unit conversions, captions; optional
    comparable listings summary. 4) Review/approve via a quick checklist. 5)
    Export listing‑ready packets (image variants, CSV/JSON, captions/SEO) and
    presets for chosen platforms or inventory systems. Agreement:
    Non‑destructive processing, privacy‑minded handling, clear SLAs, and a small
    pilot to prove fit. Starter Pack: Intake schema + taxonomy, export presets,
    caption/style guide, and SOP templates.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a 10‑piece Starter Pack or schedule a 20‑minute demo.
    Transitional: Download the free intake checklist and sample exports to see
    the output quality.
  success: >-
    A clean, searchable catalog; listings go live in hours, not weeks; fewer
    relists and metadata fixes; confident consignors; audit‑ready records;
    reclaimed team time; scalable intake capacity across seasons and shows.
  failure: >-
    Without this, the backlog grows, key details go missing, duplicates creep
    in, listings stay inconsistent, credibility erodes, deadlines slip, and
    prime sales windows are missed.
