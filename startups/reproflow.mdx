  problem:
    - >-
      Dual-purpose (milk + beef) herds struggle to balance year-round milk flow
      with steady beef calf/cull sales due to irregular breeding and calving
      patterns.
    - >-
      Manual calendars and spreadsheets don’t optimize constrained resources (AI
      tech availability, vet visit days, calving pen capacity, pasture
      seasonality, labor windows).
    - >-
      Unplanned seasonality (heat stress, forage dips, holidays) creates milk
      delivery shortfalls and revenue volatility for both milk and beef
      channels.
    - >-
      Repro KPIs (days open, calving interval, service/conception/pregnancy
      rates) are often not tracked or linked to scheduling decisions, leading to
      missed pregnancy checks and suboptimal dry-off timing.
    - >-
      Existing herd software records events but rarely optimizes multi-objective
      schedules (milk-flow smoothing + beef sales targets) tailored for
      dual-purpose operations.
    - >-
      Connectivity and language barriers limit adoption of complex tools,
      especially in Latin America and East Africa where dual-purpose herds are
      prevalent.
  solution:
    - >-
      Optimization engine builds rolling 12–18 month breeding, preg-check,
      dry-off, and calving calendars to hit milk delivery targets (e.g., ±8%
      variance) and monthly beef sales goals.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: simulate changes (semen strategy, culling, forage
      seasonality, labor constraints, heat stress forecasts) and see KPI/margin
      impacts before committing.
    - >-
      Task automation: generates weekly actionable lists (breed X cows on dates
      A–C, preg check Y, dry-off Z) with WhatsApp/SMS/mobile reminders and
      printable checklists.
    - >-
      Data integrations: import events from existing herd software, parlor
      systems, and activity/rumination sensors to update status and refine
      scheduling.
    - >-
      Localization: Spanish/Portuguese/English interfaces; offline-first mobile
      with automatic sync; regional breed defaults and climate-adjusted
      parameters.
    - >-
      ROI dashboards: track milk-flow variance, beef-calf weight/delivery
      cadence, service/conception rates, days open, calving interval, on-time
      task rate, and cash flow stability.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI planner that turns reproduction events into a single, constraint-aware
    schedule that smooths milk flow, stabilizes beef sales, and lifts
    reproductive performance—delivered offline-first and localized for
    dual-purpose herds.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built optimization for dual-purpose herds that jointly targets
    milk-flow smoothing and beef sales cadence, localized for LATAM/East Africa
