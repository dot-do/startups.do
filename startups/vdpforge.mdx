leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual VDP template setup consumes 2–8 hours per job, tying up senior
      prepress operators and delaying press time.
    - >-
      High error rates from manual rules (conditionals, imposition, postal
      marks) cause reprints and waste; typical reprint costs are 1–3% of VDP
      revenue.
    - >-
      Skilled labor shortage: onboarding a new VDP-capable operator takes 3–6
      months; turnover disrupts throughput.
    - >-
      Proof cycles are slow and fragmented (email PDFs, screenshots, markups),
      adding 1–3 days to job turnaround.
    - >-
      Device/RIP fragmentation (HP SmartStream, EFI Fiery, Canon PRISMAsync,
      Ricoh TotalFlow, Xerox FreeFlow, etc.) forces rework and duplicated
      templates.
    - >-
      Postal compliance is brittle: incorrect IMb placement, clear zones,
      endorsements, and tray/sack info risk surcharges or rejects.
    - >-
      Data validation and mapping from client files (CSV/Excel/CRM exports) is
      inconsistent; undeliverable or malformed records increase costs and erode
      client trust.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized, reusable templates across clients/products results
      in repetitive setup and tribal knowledge silos.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven ingestion of PDFs/INDD artwork plus CSV/Excel/JSON data to
      auto-detect variable fields, fonts, imagery, and conditional logic.
    - >-
      One-click generation of production-ready templates compatible with leading
      RIPs/workflows (PDF/VT, PPML, VPS; export packs for HP SmartStream, EFI
      Fiery FreeForm/FreeForm Fusion, XMPie, Quadient, FusionPro, Pageflex).
    - >-
      Automated placement and validation of postal elements (IMb, FIM,
      endorsements, address blocks, clear zones) with region-specific rules
      (USPS, Canada Post, Royal Mail).
    - >-
      Interactive rules builder to define conditions (if/then, versioning,
      graphics swaps), data validation, fallback logic, and imposition patterns
      without scripting.
    - >-
      Instant, shareable web proofs with versioned samples (n records), barcode
      tests, and approval tracking; proof history auditable per job.
    - >-
      Data mapping assistant for messy client files (header inference,
      normalization, deduping); checks for address completeness and
      personalization tokens.
    - >-
      Template library and reuse across clients/products (postcards, letters,
      self-mailers, envelopes, labels) to standardize best practices.
    - >-
      API/Connectors to print MIS/ERP (Avanti, PrintVis, ePS Pace, Tharstern),
      RIP queues, DAM, and mailing software (BCC, Quadient Bulk Mailer,
      Melissa).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn static artwork and data into press-ready VDP templates and sample
    proofs with postal marks in minutes—not days. 10x faster setup, 50–80% fewer
    errors, and guaranteed outputs for major RIPs (PDF/VT, PPML, VPS, JDF) with
    built-in postal compliance for USPS/Canada Post/Royal Mail.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Cross-RIP certified export packs, a proprietary labeled dataset of
    real-world artwork-to-data mappings, and a postal compliance engine embedded
    in the template workflow—reducing both setup time and mailing risk. Early
    OEM partnerships and prepress SME team create high switching costs and
    defensibility.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Mid-market commercial printers (20–200 FTE) operating digital presses (HP
      Indigo, Xerox iGen/Versant, Ricoh Pro, Canon imagePRESS) with recurring

    - >-
      Mail service providers/lettershops producing postcards, self-mailers,
      letters, and flats at scale.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Prepress and production teams at commercial printers (NAICS 323111) who want
    fast, accurate, mail‑ready VDP templates and proofs from static client art
    and data.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual VDP templating, data mapping, imposition, and postal marks
    are slow and error‑prone. Internal: Teams worry about rework, overruns, and
    missed SLAs. Philosophical: Printers shouldn’t spend hours wiring data to
    art when automation can do it safely and consistently.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We know the press‑check stress and mail‑date pressure. Authority:
    Built by print engineers and mailing specialists; validated in high‑volume
    CMYK/PDF workflows; exports to industry standards (PDF/VT, PPML, JDF) and
    drops into existing RIP/DFE pipelines.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload static artwork (PDF/AI) and data (CSV/Excel/JSON). 2) AI maps
    fields, builds rules, adds postal marks, and preflights. 3) Review sample
    proofs, edit rules if needed, and approve. 4) Download production‑ready
    templates, imposition, and mail‑ready assets. Assurances: Data encrypted,
    approvals controlled by you, simple month‑to‑month billing.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a free pilot with your files. Transitional: Request a
    no‑obligation sample proof and VDP readiness checklist.
  success: >-
    Setup time drops from hours to minutes; proofs match production; postal
    compliance built‑in; fewer reruns; on‑time mailings; higher throughput; more
    profitable VDP wins; predictable prepress for confident sales estimates.
  failure: >-
    Manual setups continue to cause bottlenecks, data mismatches, rejected mail
    pieces, missed mail dates, expensive reruns, overtime, and lost bids.
