leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned process drifts in steeping, germination, and kilning cause COA
      deviations (e.g., moisture, friability, color, beta-glucan), leading to
      downgrades or rework in 3–8% of batches at many sites.
    - >-
      Operators face alarm fatigue from generic SCADA thresholds (>300
      alarms/shift at large plants), missing subtle multivariate drifts that
      precede hot spots, uneven germination, airflow blockage, or
      over/under-steep events.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis is slow and tribal-knowledge based; mean time to
      detect (MTTD) early-stage anomalies is often >2 hours, and mean time to
      resolve (MTTR) exceeds 6–12 hours, increasing energy use and risk to
      quality.
    - >-
      Existing historian/SPC tools require manual tagging and expert
      configuration; they underperform on non-linear interactions among
      temperature, airflow, CO2, moisture, and bed depth across vessels.
    - >-
      Cost impact per medium/large plant: $250k–$1.2M/year from yield loss,
      quality downgrades, overtime, and energy waste (1–3% extra energy per ton
      on off-nominal kilning).
    - >-
      Compliance and audit gaps: HACCP/FSMA and customer audits require
      traceable actions tied to deviations; current logs are fragmented across
      SCADA, email, and shift notes.
    - >-
      Data is underutilized: plants collect thousands of tags via OSIsoft
      PI/AVEVA, Ignition, and PLCs, but lack real-time, process-aware anomaly
      ranking and actionable checks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-connected AI monitors key tags (e.g., bed temp profiles, grain
      moisture, CO2, airflow static pressure, fan speed, wet/dry steep timing,
      water temp, pH) and learns normal patterns per vessel and malt type.
    - >-
      Ranks anomalies by risk to COA attributes (friability, color, DP,
      beta-glucan) using a process knowledge graph and historical incident
      library.
    - >-
      Pushes actionable checks for operators (e.g., inspect fan VFD and filters,
      confirm air plenum differential pressure, verify moisture probe
      calibration, adjust steep water temp) with one-click acknowledgment and
      audit trail.
    - >-
      Integrates with OSIsoft PI/AF, Ignition, OPC UA, SAP QM/LIMS; exports
      deviations to shift handover and quality non-conformance workflows.
    - >-
      Hybrid deployment: on-prem edge for inference (<250 ms latency) with
      cloud/single-tenant or on-prem server for model training, governance, and
      fleet benchmarking.
    - >-
      8–12 week implementation: data audit and tag mapping (2 weeks), baseline
      modeling on 90 days of data (3–4 weeks), validation with SMEs (2 weeks),
      pilot run on 1–2 vessels and a kiln (4 weeks) with agreed success criteria
      (precision/recall, MTTA/MTTR, COA deviations).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Prevent COA deviations and energy waste by detecting and ranking
    multivariate drifts in steep/germ/kiln in real time—paired with actionable,
    process-specific checks—integrated to your historian and deployable in
    weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, cross-site incident and resolution dataset for malting operations
    plus a malting-specific knowledge graph that ties multivariate tag patterns
    to COA risk and prescriptive checks. This domain asset yields superior alert
    ranking and low false positives versus generic anomaly tools. Partnerships
    with OEMs and SI networks further reduce time-to-value and switching
    likelihood.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ops leaders, head maltsters, and process engineers in malt houses who want
    predictable, audit-ready quality without constant firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Process drifts in steep/germ/kiln hide in thousands of tags;
    alarms are noisy and late, risking color, modification, friability, and DMS
    precursors. Internal: Teams feel blind and reactive, worried they’ll miss a
    drift on nights/weekends. Philosophical: You shouldn’t need a data scientist
    to know when your malt is going off-track.
  guide: >-
    We specialize in malt manufacturing analytics. Our AI learns normal behavior
    per vessel and campaign, ranks anomalies by quality risk, and suggests
    targeted checks (e.g., probe calibration, damper/fan/VFD positions, airflow
    paths, spray rate, CO₂ scrubber, bed turning). Built by process engineers +
    data scientists; secure, historian-integrated, and production-proven.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: Read tags from PI/Ignition/OPC; map to steep/germ/kiln assets.
    2) Calibrate: Learn from good runs and SOP limits; align alerts to CQAs. 3)
    Run: Real-time scoring with ranked alerts, suggested checks, and weekly
    tuning. Optional 30-day pilot on one line.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Book a 30-minute process review. Secondary: Start a 30-day pilot on
    one line.
  success: >-
    Minutes-to-detection instead of hours; 30–60% fewer quality excursions;
    steadier moisture/temperature profiles; less rework and energy waste;
    audit-ready traceability; calmer shifts and higher throughput.
  failure: >-
    Without it, hidden drifts become off-spec malt, rework, wasted energy,
    missed delivery windows, alarm fatigue, and eroded customer trust.

  problem:
    - >-
      Quality drift hides in small changes to temp, airflow, spray flow, and bed
      DP.
    - >-
      Static alarm limits miss multivariable interactions and shift with
      barley/lots.
    - Alarm floods create fatigue—critical issues get buried.
    - Root-cause hunts slow response and increase rework risk.
    - Batch-to-batch variability makes thresholds hard to tune.
    - Deviations inflate energy use and threaten yield and color targets.

      Continuously models steep, germ, and kiln tags to spot abnormal patterns
      in real time.
    - >-
