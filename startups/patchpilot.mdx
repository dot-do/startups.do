leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Security alert overload from SCA/SAST/DAST/NVD/OSV feeds results in >1,000
      alerts/month for mid-sized publishers; 70–90% are low-risk or duplicates.
    - >-
      Manual triage lacks exploitability context (EPSS/KEV/reachability),
      leading to slow MTTR and misprioritization.
    - >-
      Engineering teams lose 10–20% of capacity to chasing and coordinating
      fixes across repos/versions; patch drift and backporting are error-prone.
    - >-
      Auto-remediation from existing tools is narrow (dependency bumps) and
      often breaks builds due to missing tests and rollout plans.
    - >-
      Audit/compliance pressure (SOC2/PCI/ISO/FedRAMP) requires evidence of
      timely remediation and SLAs; collecting proof is manual and inconsistent.
    - >-
      Multi-language, polyrepo/monorepo codebases make consistent remediation
      and version support (LTS) difficult.
    - >-
      Fear of regressions and lack of canary strategies cause teams to defer
      patches, increasing exposure window.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest alerts and SBOMs from
      NVD/OSV/Snyk/GHAS/Dependabot/Jira and normalize into a unified graph.
    - >-
      Prioritize with exploitability context: EPSS, CISA KEV, Exploit DB, social
      signals, and repo-specific reachability (static call-graph + dynamic
      traces) to produce a Patch Readiness Score per alert.
    - >-
      Generate human-reviewable fix PRs: code changes + dependency bumps +
      config hardening + migration notes; include unit/integration tests and
      build fixes where needed.
    - >-
      Propose rollout plans: feature flags, canary cohorts, staged rollouts, and
      backports to supported versions; generate change logs and release notes.
    - >-
      Integrate with CI/CD (GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps/Bitbucket) to run tests
      and policy checks; block/allow by risk and SLA policies.
    - >-
      Provide an executive and team dashboard: MTTR by severity, SLA adherence,
      auto-fix rate, backlog burn-down, and audit-ready evidence (who approved,
      when deployed).
    - >-
      Offer deployment options: secure SaaS with customer-managed keys or
      private cloud/on-prem; full audit logs, data residency, and SSO/SCIM.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: reviewers see diffs, test plans, blast radius
      analysis, and rollback steps; one-click accept/modify/decline.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut vulnerability MTTR by 50–80% by ranking alerts on true exploitability
    and shipping safe, tested, auto-generated fix PRs with a rollout plan—so
    your teams remediate faster with fewer regressions and better audit
    evidence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Exploitability-first remediation graph that fuses EPSS/KEV, static
    reachability, dynamic traces, and business criticality—paired with a guarded
    LLM+AST code-mod system trained on a growing corpus of successful, tested
    vulnerability fixes and rollout outcomes across languages and versions. Deep
    CI/CD and release orchestration plus audit-grade evidence make the solution
    hard to replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:

    Software publishers (NAICS 513210) — CTOs, engineering leaders, and
    DevSecOps teams who must ship fast without compromising security.
  problem: >-
    Drowning in CVEs and noisy alerts; unclear exploitability and impact; manual
    patching slows releases and risks regressions; missed SLAs threaten trust
    and compliance — security should accelerate shipping, not block it.
  guide: >-
    We understand alert fatigue and release pressure; our AI prioritizes by real
    exploitability/impact and drafts fix PRs with tests and a rollout plan,
    integrating with your repos and ticketing to fit how you ship.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect repos, SBOM, and alert feeds; 2) Get a prioritized queue plus
    ready-to-review PRs with tests and staged rollout guidance; 3) Review,
    merge, and monitor canary rollout with automated checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a demo or start a pilot — connect GitHub/GitLab and your tracker to
    activate triage and patch suggestions.
  success: >-
    Clear signal over noise, faster MTTR, fewer sev-1s, compliant patch SLAs,
    quieter on-call, and confident, faster releases.
  failure: >-
    Breaches from known vulns, exploit-driven outages, SLA penalties, audit
    findings, and lost customer trust and churn.

      We dedupe and score each finding by exploitability, reachability, and
      impact.
    - 'We generate a ready-to-merge PR with patch, tests, and notes.'
    - A rollout plan is attached with canary stages and rollback conditions.
