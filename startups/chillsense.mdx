  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned compressor/evaporator failures during peak summer lead to lost
      production and missed retailer deliveries; downtime can cost
      $3,000–$10,000 per hour including labor, product loss, and penalties.
    - >-
      Parts lead times (compressors, bearings, valves, fan motors, contactors)
      range from 3–21 days; plants lack data-driven spare stock planning,
      causing prolonged outages.
    - >-
      Time-based preventive maintenance misses hidden issues (bearing wear,
      refrigerant leaks, condenser fouling, short-cycling); SCADA/PLC alarms are
      threshold-based and reactive, not predictive.
    - >-
      Fragmented visibility across multi-brand equipment and plants; limited
      data capture on older assets without modern controllers; reliance on
      contractors’ periodic rounds.
    - >-
      Seasonality amplifies risk (May–September). Failures during peak demand
      have outsized revenue impact; managers lack early warning to schedule
      downtime off-peak.
  solution:
    - >-
      Non-invasive sensor kit for compressors, motors, evaporators, condensers,
      and gearboxes: 3-axis vibration + current clamp + surface temp + optional
      pressure taps; edge gateway with LTE/Ethernet.
    - >-
      AI/ML models tuned to ice manufacturing duty cycles detect bearing wear,
      imbalance/misalignment, refrigerant leaks/undercharge, condenser fouling,
      cavitation, valve issues, short-cycling, icing events.
    - >-
      Parts readiness engine: maps predicted failures to BOM and lead times;
      recommends on-hand spares and auto-creates purchase requisitions in
      CMMS/ERP.
    - >-
      Actionable alerts and workflows: severity-scored alerts with root-cause
      hypotheses, recommended checks, and estimated time-to-failure; integrates
      with CMMS tickets.
    - >-
      Seasonal load forecasting and energy optimization: cleaning schedules for
      condensers/evaporators, defrost optimization, and setpoint drift
      detection.
    - >-
      Fleet dashboards: plant/asset health, risk heatmaps, trend analytics, and
      post-mortems to improve PM plans.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Stop peak-season ice machine and compressor failures. Predict issues 1–3
    weeks early, roll a tech with the right parts, and cut unplanned downtime
    30–50% while reducing energy 3–8%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific failure models and parts-readiness mapping built from ice
    manufacturing datasets; ability to predict not just failure but required
    parts and scheduling windows. Multi-brand, retrofit-friendly solution that
    augments existing SCADA/PM programs, plus seasonal load forecasting tied to
    real demand patterns. Early partnerships with contractors and OEMs create
    data network effects and distribution advantages.

  character: >-
    Ops and maintenance leaders at ice manufacturing plants (NAICS 312113) who
    must keep compressors and ice makers running, hit delivery windows, and
    control maintenance spend.
  problem: >-
    External: surprise compressor/ice-maker failures cause downtime, scrap/melt,
    rush repairs, and parts delays. Internal: teams are tired of firefighting
    and guessing when equipment will fail. Philosophical: uptime shouldn’t rely
    on luck—data should warn you before breakdowns.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of a stopped bin and missed routes. Our OEM-agnostic
    AI monitors vibration, amps, temps, and pressures across refrigeration and
    ice assets, turning anomalies into clear actions. Backed by ice-plant
    references, secure deployments, HACCP-ready reporting, and 24/7 support.
  plan: >-
    1) Instrument and connect: clip-on sensors or SCADA/API—no shutdown.

    2) Learn and predict: AI builds baselines per asset, flags drifts, and
    estimates time-to-failure.

    3) Act with parts ready: auto work orders, parts kits, and scheduled
    maintenance windows.

    Assurance: your data stays yours; cyber-hardened; 60-day pilot with clear
    success criteria.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute assessment and start a 60-day pilot on one line.
    Transitional: Download the ROI calculator and sample alert/playbook.
  success: >-
    Predictable production with 30–50% fewer breakdowns, higher OEE, lower
    energy and maintenance costs, right-sized spares, audit-ready
    temperature/compliance logs, and a calmer team that hits every delivery.
  failure: >-
    Keep reacting to failures: emergency outages, melted inventory and scrap,
    overtime and expediting, missed contracts, safety/compliance risk, and
    reputational damage.
