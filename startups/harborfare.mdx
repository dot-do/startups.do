leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Large demand swings by season, day-of-week, and weather cause low off-peak
      load factors (often <40%) and peak sell-outs that leave revenue on the
      table.
    - >-
      Most operators use fixed or seasonal tariffs; price and promo changes
      require manual board or management approvals, leading to slow reactions
      and missed opportunities.
    - >-
      Public-agency fare equity and regulatory constraints (caps, discount
      entitlements, advance posting) make airline-style dynamic pricing unusable
      without a compliant rules engine.
    - >-
      Capacity disruptions (vessel OOS, crew limits, fog/wind) and short booking
      windows make forecasting difficult; no-shows and spoilage (empty seats)
      remain high.
    - >-
      Marketing spends are broad and untargeted; promos don’t shift demand to
      underutilized sailings or are launched too late to matter.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated analytics: operators can’t quantify elasticity, promo
      ROI, or the revenue–load factor tradeoff at a sailing/route level.
  solution:
    - >-
      Forecast demand at sailing level using historical bookings, weather/tides,
      events, and competitor substitutes; produce 2–8 week rolling forecasts.
    - >-
      Estimate route-specific price elasticity and no-show rates; compute
      revenue/load factor frontiers under policy constraints.
    - >-
      Constraint-aware optimizer recommends fare buckets, discounts, and promo
      spend by sailing within caps, entitlements, and advance-notice rules.
    - >-
      Automated promo engine triggers targeted offers (time-shift, bundle,
      resident/commuter specials) across owned and partner channels to fill
      low-load sailings.
    - >-
      What-if simulator for planners to test policy changes (e.g., cap from ±10%
      to ±15%) and seasonal schedules before board approval.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: explainable recommendations, audit trails, and
      one-click deployment with rollback; nightly or intra-day update cadence as
      allowed.
    - >-
      Weather/capacity-aware guardrails that freeze or roll back pricing during
      disruptions and protect mandatory discounts (e.g., ADA, resident passes).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI pricing and promotion agent that safely raises revenue 3–8% and boosts
    off-peak load factor 10–20 points by making constraint-aware fare and promo
    adjustments—fully compliant with public policy, equity rules, and maritime
    regulations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A constraint-aware pricing engine specialized for public ferry and regulated
    maritime contexts, with equity guardrails and explainability baked in;
    route-level elasticity priors and weather-aware demand models trained on
    coastal and Great Lakes patterns; integrations and compliance artifacts that
    reduce procurement and board-approval friction.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ferry and passenger-service operators on coastal and Great Lakes routes
    (GMs, revenue managers, planners) who must fill boats and hit revenue
    targets while honoring tariffs, caps, and public oversight.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile, seasonal demand and fixed capacity create empty seats
    one day and turn-aways the next; static fares and blanket promos miss the
    mark. Internal: teams juggle spreadsheets and politics, unsure which levers
    to pull without breaching rules. Philosophical: essential transport should
    be priced fairly and transparently—not by guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the scrutiny regulated operators face; our AI agent learns
    from your ridership, weather, events, and policy rules to recommend
    compliant fare and promotion adjustments.
  plan: >-
    3 steps: 1) Connect data (ridership, schedules, tariffs/caps, POS). 2) Set
    guardrails (policy, regulatory, equity, customer promises). 3) Launch
    recommendations with human-in-the-loop approvals and continuous monitoring.
    Includes audit trail, rollback, and a pilot on one route.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30-day pilot on a priority route. Transitional: Request a
    free demand-and-yield diagnostic from last season.
  success: >-
    Balanced load factors and higher yield by departure, fewer stock-outs and
    cancellations, compliant and auditable decisions, fair targeted promotions,
    and confident updates to boards and regulators.
  failure: >-
    Persisting status quo: empty seats in shoulder periods, oversold peak
    sailings, revenue leakage, policy breaches and fines, public backlash over
    perceived unfairness, and teams buried in manual re-pricing.
