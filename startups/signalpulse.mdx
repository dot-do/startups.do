leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      PR teams waste 6–10 hours/week/AE triaging noisy mentions across news,
      social, podcasts, and blogs; 60–80% are duplicates or off‑topic.
    - >-
      High risk of late crisis detection; issues often trend for 2–6 hours
      before being noticed during off‑hours or weekends, leading to costly
      escalations.
    - >-
      Existing tools focus on dashboards, not action; alerts are either too
      frequent (alert fatigue) or too slow (digest delays).
    - >-
      Routing is manual; the right client lead or crisis pod often sees critical
      mentions late due to channel chaos (email, spreadsheets, multiple tools).
    - >-
      Measuring impact is hard; agencies struggle to quantify response time,
      media quality, and share of voice in real time for clients.
    - >-
      Tool sprawl (Brandwatch, Meltwater, Talkwalker, manual searches) increases
      costs and creates fragmented signals.
    - >-
      Non‑English and regional coverage are weak or expensive; multi‑language
      classification and deduplication are inconsistent.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trails for what was seen/when are missing, creating
      liability during crises.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified ingestion from news, web, forums, podcasts, and supported social
      APIs with near‑real‑time crawling and de‑duplication.
    - >-
      LLM‑powered classification tuned for PR use cases: relevance to
      brand/execs, sentiment/emotion, issue category, outlet quality, likely
      reach, and risk scoring.
    - >-
      Statistical spike/novelty detection with guardrails to suppress common
      false positives (e.g., wire reposts, syndication).
    - >-
      Priority scoring that blends content signals (sentiment, outlet authority,
      virality potential) with client‑specific rules and watchlists.
    - >-
      Smart routing to Slack/Teams channels or DMs with quiet hours,
      escalations, and on‑call rotations; email/SMS failover for P0 alerts.
    - >-
      Digest modes (hourly/daily) by client with top mentions, trends, and
      anomalies; one‑click client‑ready summaries.
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑loop feedback to continuously reduce noise; per‑client models
      improve over time.
    - >-
      Audit trail and SLA reporting: who saw what, when, and how fast the team
      responded.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Always‑on, low‑noise media and social monitoring that flags what truly
    matters and routes it to exactly the right people in Slack/Teams within
    minutes—so agencies respond faster, miss less, and prove value to clients.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    PR‑tuned alert quality loop: proprietary labeled datasets from partner
    agencies + in‑workflow feedback signals; latency‑optimized pipeline that
    beats dashboard‑first incumbents on time‑to‑signal and noise suppression.
    Deep Slack/Teams routing with SLAs and audit trails makes switching away
    costly.

    PR agency account leads and communications teams who must protect client
    reputations, surface opportunities fast, and prove impact in real time.
  problem: >-
    - External: Mentions flood in 24/7 across news, podcasts, social, and
    forums; critical signals get buried.

    noisy tools; manual triage eats time.

    - Philosophical: You should hear about your client from your alerts—not from
    a journalist or trending thread.

    - Empathy: We know the war‑room pressure and the “did we miss anything?”
    feeling.

    - Authority: LLM‑powered listening that classifies
    entities/topics/sentiment, detects spikes/anomalies, and routes prioritized
    alerts to Slack/Teams—purpose‑built for PR agency workflows with tuning and
    auditability.
