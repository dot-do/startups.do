  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and integrators must hit temperature/humidity/air quality curves
      to meet live production targets, but setpoints are tuned manually and
      inconsistently by house, shift, and weather.
    - >-
      Energy is the second-largest controllable cost in broiler grow-out;
      propane/natural gas and ventilation fans are often run inefficiently,
      causing 10–30% avoidable energy spend.
    - >-
      Out-of-range conditions (RH > 70%, NH3 > 25 ppm, CO2 > 3,000 ppm, temp
      ±3°F from curve) increase mortality, worsen FCR, and risk welfare audit
      findings and settlement penalties.
    - >-
      Existing controllers automate basic curves but don’t optimize across
      external weather, bird age, litter moisture, energy prices, and equipment
      performance—nor do they learn house-level behavior.
    - >-
      Complex managers lack a unified, auditable way to ensure hundreds of
      houses adhere to integrator setpoints while minimizing energy and
      maintaining welfare.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across controller OEMs; service techs and growers lack an
      actionable, verified “daily plan” with guardrails and M&V of savings.
  solution:
    - >-
      House-level digital twin that learns thermal response, litter moisture
      dynamics, and equipment behavior (fans, inlets, heaters, pads) per barn
      and season.
    - >-
      Continuous optimization of setpoints (target temp, RH window, minimum
      ventilation rate, static pressure, heater staging, pad usage,
      variable-speed fan bands) against integrator curves, weather forecasts,
      energy prices, and house constraints.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: daily plan sent to grower/service tech;
      single-tap confirm/apply on compatible controllers; exceptions require
      confirmation; instant rollback and safe modes.
    - >-
      Welfare and safety guardrails: hard limits on temp, RH, NH3, CO2, and
      static pressure; automatic fail-safe to OEM controller curve on
      sensor/controller fault.
    - >-
      Cross-OEM integration via gateway/API (e.g., Rotem/Munters, Cumberland
      EDGE, Chore-Time, Big Dutchman, AP). Adds CO2/NH3/RH sensors if absent.
    - >-
      Enterprise cockpit for complex managers: adherence dashboards, alerts,
      audit trails, and benchmarking across farms/houses.
    - >-
      M&V module: baseline modeling (pre/post and matched-weather cohorts)
      producing verified energy and welfare KPIs for settlements, rebates, and
      sustainability reporting.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit your integrator’s environment curves with fewer clicks and lower energy.
    AviSet Optimize delivers AI-recommended setpoints/schedules with welfare
    guardrails and human confirmation—cutting energy 10–20% per lb while
    reducing out-of-range time by 40–60%, with auditable M&V and enterprise
    oversight.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    House-specific digital twins trained across diverse geographies and
    equipment, combined with cross-OEM integrations and welfare guardrails that
    produce auditable, M&V-backed savings. Early utility rebate alignments and
    university-validated trials create defensible credibility and switching
    costs.

    Broiler growers and integrator field techs (NAICS 112320) who want to hit
    the integrator’s environment curve, protect welfare, and control energy
    costs.
  problem: >-
    External: Weather swings, volatile fuel prices, and complex equipment make
    setpoints hard to manage across flocks and hours.

    Internal: Stress about missing the curve, chargebacks, and overnight alarms.

    Philosophical: Good bird welfare shouldn’t require wasteful energy or
    constant manual tweaking.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve managed and audited broiler barns—every degree matters and
    alarms don’t wait.

    Authority: Built with poultry science, HVAC, and data engineering; validated
    against historical flock outcomes and integrator targets. Includes
    guardrails, audit trails, and human-in-the-loop approvals.
  plan: >-
    Process plan:

    1) Connect barn sensors/controllers and import integrator curves.

    2) AI proposes setpoints and schedules for ventilation, heating, and
    humidity within welfare and safety limits.

    3) You review/confirm; the system monitors outcomes, auto-adjusts, and
    alerts on exceptions.

    Agreement plan:

    - You approve every change.

    - Guardrails prevent welfare or equipment-risk moves.

    - Data remains yours; roles and permissions are clear.

    - No-risk pilot; cancel anytime.
