  problem:
    - >-
      Brokers spend 10–20 hours per week manually hunting buyers/suppliers
      across directories, trade shows, and marketplaces, yielding inconsistent
      pipeline.
    - >-
      Contact data is stale or incomplete; email bounce rates often exceed 10%
      and phone connect rates are <5%, wasting time and hurting sender
      reputation.
    - >-
      Compliance complexity (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL, TCPA, UK PECR, Do-Not-Call)
      creates risk and slows outreach; teams lack practical guardrails to
      operate safely across regions.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain (data provider + enrichment + verifier + sequencer +
      CRM) increases cost and ops friction; small teams lack RevOps expertise to
      stitch it together.
    - >-
      Lead prioritization is guesswork; reps waste 30–50% of time on low-intent
      or mismatched accounts (wrong HS codes, regions, order volumes).
    - >-
      Trade-specific intent (recent shipments, HS codes, supplier switches) is
      hard to access/operationalize; general B2B tools miss wholesale signals.
    - >-
      Message personalization is shallow; reps struggle to reference product
      specs, compliance, MOQs, or Incoterms at scale, leading to low reply and
      meeting rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Trade-intent sourcing: unify shipment records, product taxonomies
      (HS/NAICS), and directory data to surface recent importers/exporters by
      category, volume, and lanes.
    - >-
      Contact enrichment: auto-append decision-makers with validated
      emails/phones, roles, and region; verify deliverability and DNC status
      in-line.
    - >-
      Lead scoring: model propensity using shipment recency/volume, supplier
      churn, geography match, and historical reply/meeting outcomes.
    - >-
      Compliance-first sequencer: email, phone, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp with
      jurisdiction-aware throttles, quiet hours, and automated opt-out/DNC
      suppression.
    - >-
      AI copy tailored to wholesale: references HS codes, MOQs, certifications,
      Incoterms, and product specs; A/B tests and learns from outcomes.
    - >-
      CRM-native workflows: bi-directional sync with Salesforce, HubSpot,
      Pipedrive; de-duplication; activity logging; owner routing.
    - >-
      Inbox and domain management: warm-up, rotation, and reputation monitoring
      to keep bounce rates <3% and inbox placement high.
    - >-
      Playbooks and lists: prebuilt buyer/supplier lists by category/region and
      proven outreach scripts for brokers; 1-click deploy.
    - >-
      Analytics and ROI: track net-new verified accounts, reply rates by
      channel, meeting rate, cost per meeting, and pipeline generated.
    - >-
      API/CSV ops: import your SKUs/HS codes or customer lists to find
      lookalikes and run targeted campaigns.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that finds high-intent buyers/suppliers using trade signals, enriches and
    scores them, and runs compliant multi-channel outreach—so wholesale brokers
    create predictable pipeline 2–3x faster with 50–80% less manual work.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific trade-intent graph (shipments, HS codes, supplier changes)
    fused with contact and compliance data, enabling precise buyer/supplier
    matching and higher-intent outreach than generalist tools; reinforced by
    proprietary outcome-labeled datasets from wholesale campaigns and a
    compliance engine purpose-built for multi-jurisdiction B2B outreach.
