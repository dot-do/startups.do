  problem:
    - >-
      Agents and teams spend 5–10 hours/week manually scanning MLS feeds and
      setting up saved searches, causing missed hot listings and slower client
      response times.
    - >-
      Coordinating multi-stop buyer tours is time-consuming (30–60 minutes/tour)
      and error-prone due to showing windows, traffic, and dispersed listings.
    - >-
      Existing MLS auto-emails are noisy and generic; clients ignore them
      (typical open rates 15–25%), reducing engagement and agent perceived
      value.
    - >-
      Teams lack a centralized, cross-agent view of active buyers, criteria,
      activity, and next steps, leading to duplicated work and poor handoffs.
    - >-
      Agents often learn of new listings after their clients do (via portals),
      hurting agent authority and conversion.
    - >-
      Compliance and data fragmentation across MLSs make it difficult to
      standardize alerts, dedupe listings across overlapping MLSs, and include
      agent-only fields for better screening.
  solution:
    - >-
      Direct MLS/VOW ingestion via RESO Web API + marketplace partners for near
      real-time listing updates; dedupe across overlapping MLSs.
    - >-
      Buyer Profile Builder that captures explicit criteria (price, beds,
      commute, schools) and implicit preferences from client feedback and agent
      notes.
    - >-
      Curated Digests: branded, mobile-friendly emails/SMS with top-N picks,
      urgency highlights (price drops, back-on-market), and one-tap client
      feedback.
    - >-
      Ranking & Relevance: AI scores listings by buyer-specific signals
      (micro-location, floorplan text, amenities) to cut noise and raise
      precision.
    - >-
      Tour Planner: auto-optimizes multi-stop routes with showing windows,
      travel times, contingencies, and printed/Shareable itineraries.
    - >-
      Integrations: Showing management (e.g., ShowingTime), calendars
      (Google/Microsoft), CRM (Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, Chime), and map providers
      (Google/Mapbox).
    - >-
      Team Dashboard: centralized view of all active buyers, match health, tour
      status, and SLA alerts; permissions for assistants and TCs.
    - >-
      Compliance & Audit: MLS/VOW rules enforcement, agent-only remark handling,
      branding and disclaimers, activity logs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Never miss a match, never waste a mile. BuyerMatch Concierge continuously
    scans MLS data, ranks new listings to each buyer’s real preferences, sends
    branded digests clients actually read, and auto-builds optimized multi-stop
    tours with showing windows and live traffic—reducing search and planning
    time by 70%+ and helping agents respond to hot listings in minutes, not
    hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Operational telemetry across many offices (buyer feedback, route outcomes,
    response times) continuously trains our ranking and routing models,
    producing measurably better matches and faster tours than generic MLS alerts
    or static tools. Combined with direct MLS marketplace relationships and
    compliance tooling, we deliver faster alerts, higher-quality digests, and
    one-click tours that competitors without deep MLS access and learning loops
    struggle to match.
