leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High SKU/channel proliferation (flavors, pack sizes, formats) drives
      volatile demand and planning complexity, causing frequent stockouts and
      overstocks
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheet-based forecasting and MPS processes consume 10–30
      hours/week per planner and are error-prone
    - >-
      Retailer OTIF penalties and service-level agreements (e.g., 97–99% fill
      rates) penalize late/short shipments
    - >-
      Promotions and seasonal effects (tax season, holidays, weather) are not
      systematically captured, creating demand spikes and write-offs
    - >-
      Lead time variability for proteins, vitamins/minerals, and packaging
      causes safety-stock miscalculation
    - >-
      Finite capacity constraints (line speeds, can/bag sizes, changeovers,
      retort/oven availability) are ignored by most generic planning tools
    - >-
      Shelf-life and lot-expiry constraints (especially for wet/canned) are not
      incorporated into the MPS, causing scrap and margin erosion
    - >-
      Siloed data across ERP, WMS, retailer portals, and e-commerce creates
      lagging and inconsistent signals
    - Co-manufacturing adds visibility gaps and unreliable promise dates
    - >-
      Lack of actionable risk alerts (service-risk hotspots, component
      shortages) delays decisions
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from ERP/WMS (orders, shipments, on-hand), retailer
      portals/EDI, e-commerce, promotions, and external signals (weather, macro,
      pet adoption)
    - >-
      ML-based hierarchical forecasting at SKU x channel x week with demand
      sensing for near-term windows
    - >-
      Automated safety-stock optimization by SKU/channel using service targets,
      forecast error, and lead-time variability
    - >-
      Finite-capacity MPS engine with line speeds, batch sizes,
      setup/changeovers, retort/oven constraints, and campaign logic
    - >-
      BOM explosion from finished goods to raw/pack materials with component
      coverage and supply-risk flags
    - >-
      Exception-driven workflows and service-risk heatmaps (e.g., stockout in
      2–3 weeks, expiring inventory)
    - >-
      Scenario planning: promotions, price changes, new SKUs, lead-time shocks,
      and co-man capacity changes
    - >-
      Collaborative planning with audit trail of overrides and forecast adoption
      metrics
    - >-
      Fast deployment with prebuilt connectors for NetSuite, SAP B1, Microsoft
      Dynamics, SPS Commerce/retailer portals
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce SKU-level forecast error by 20–40% and cut planning time by 50% while
    hitting 98.5%+ service levels. PawCast turns multi-source demand signals
    into weekly, finite-capacity MPS that respects shelf-life, changeovers, and
    BOM constraints—deployed in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pretrained pet-food-specific models and MPS templates (wet/dry/treats), plus
    a connector library to major ERPs and retailer portals enable deployment in
    weeks. Anonymized cross-customer patterns (subject to contracts) improve
    accuracy, and the finite-capacity engine encodes pet-food-specific
    constraints (retort/oven time, changeovers, FEFO) that generalist tools
    lack.
  customerSegments:

  character: >-
    Operations and supply planning leaders at dog and cat food manufacturers who
    need reliable SKU/channel forecasts and a feasible weekly MPS.
  problem: >-
    External: volatile demand by channel, promos/seasonality, long ingredient
    lead times, changeover/allergen constraints, short shelf-life. Internal:
    planners stuck in fragile spreadsheets and firefighting, unsure which SKUs
    to build. Philosophical: teams shouldn’t have to guess—pets should never
    wait for food.
  guide: >-
    We understand pet-food complexity—multi-SKU recipes, extrusion and retort
    lines, allergens, and retailer calendars—and we speak planner, not buzzword.
    Our AI assistant integrates with your ERP/MES and turns history plus
    constraints into transparent forecasts and schedules you can trust.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect: ingest orders, POS, promos, BOMs, routings, capacities, and
    inventory. 2) Calibrate: tune SKU/channel models, safety-stock targets, and
    constraints. 3) Operate: generate rolling forecasts and a weekly MPS with
    risk flags, scenarios, and planner approval.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: start a 4–6 week pilot on priority SKUs. Transitional: request a
    sample forecast and MPS from your last 24 months of data.
  success: >-
    Higher service levels and OTIF, right-sized inventory, fewer changeovers and
    expedites, lower write-offs, aligned procurement and production, confident
    S&OP decisions.
  failure: >-
    Stockouts and lost sales, rush orders and penalties, overtime or idle lines,
    expired inventory, missed launches, and constant re-planning.
