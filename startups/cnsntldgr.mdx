leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Publishers and list brokers lack verifiable consent provenance for a large
      portion of contacts (often 20–40%), exposing them to fines and
      deliverability risk.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction tagging is inconsistent; the same list may include EU,
      Canadian, and US contacts without clear, enforceable lawful-basis rules
      per record.
    - >-
      Suppression data is fragmented across ESPs, CRMs, and data warehouses;
      accidental sends to unsubscribed/complaining users occur (1–3% leakage),
      harming sender reputation and risking penalties.
    - >-
      Regulator- or client-ready compliance evidence is time-consuming to
      compile (2–6 weeks), manual, and non-repeatable across audits.
    - >-
      Regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR lawful basis, CASL express vs implied
      consent, CAN-SPAM opt-out windows) evolve; in-house teams struggle to keep
      rules current and operationalized across systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated data connectors ingest contacts, consent logs, and suppression
      lists from ESPs, CRMs, CDPs, and data lakes; normalize to a unified
      consent schema.
    - >-
      AI-assisted consent provenance extraction: parse signup forms, contracts,
      UTM parameters, timestamps, IP geolocation, and evidence artifacts; score
      confidence and highlight gaps.
    - >-
      Jurisdiction tagging engine: per-record determination of applicable
      regimes (GDPR/ePrivacy, CASL, CAN-SPAM) using multi-signal inference
      (country fields, IP, mailing address, phone country code, domain TLD, user
      self-attest).
    - >-
      Unified suppression management: deduplicate and reconcile unsubscribes,
      complaints, bounces, and third-party opt-out registries; publish a
      canonical suppression service to all send systems via API/webhooks.
    - >-
      Real-time enforcement: a low-latency decision endpoint to allow/deny
      campaigns at send-time based on jurisdiction rules and suppression status.
    - >-
      Auditable compliance pack: regulator/client-ready bundle with immutable
      evidence (hashes, timestamps), policy mappings to specific
      articles/sections, coverage metrics, and remediation plan.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring: alerts on rule changes, consent expiry/implied
      consent windows (CASL), and sudden drops in provenance confidence.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Single pane for consent provenance, jurisdiction-aware policy enforcement,
    and cross-system suppression—delivering a regulator-ready compliance pack in
    48 hours and reducing accidental non-compliant sends by 90%+.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Auditable Compliance Pack with cryptographic evidence (hash-chained
    artifacts and time-stamped rule versions) plus a cross-system suppression
    hub integrated at send-time—features competitors either don’t offer or
    cannot easily replicate due to required labeled data, connectors depth, and
    legal-rule traceability.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Directory and Mailing List Publishers (NAICS 513140) who need to legally
    mail and monetize data without fines, blocks, or partner friction.
  problem: >-
    External: fragmented consent provenance, inconsistent jurisdiction tagging,
    gaps in suppression coverage create CAN-SPAM/GDPR/CASL risk. Internal:
    uncertainty about what’s compliant and fear of audits/blocks. Philosophical:
    legitimate publishers shouldn’t be punished for inherited, opaque data.
  guide: >-
    An independent AI compliance auditor that understands publisher workflows
    and privacy law. We speak both legal and deliverability, and bring proven
    frameworks, checklists, and audit templates to make compliance practical and
    defensible.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Ingest lists and consent evidence; 2) AI maps consent provenance
    and jurisdiction (CAN-SPAM/GDPR/CASL); 3) Gap analysis of suppression rules
    and coverage; 4) Remediate with global/per-law suppressions and rules; 5)
    Deliver an auditable compliance pack and monitoring. Agreement: DPA in
    place, read-only scoped access, encryption end-to-end, no data resale.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a compliance audit or start a one-list pilot. Transitional:
    Download the compliance checklist, request a sample audit pack, or schedule
    a 15‑minute scoping call.
  success: >-
    Clean, jurisdiction-tagged lists; provable consent provenance; synchronized
    suppression across ESP/CRM; fewer complaints/blocks; faster partner
    approvals; audit-ready pack that stands up to counsel and regulator
    scrutiny.
  failure: >-
    Regulatory fines, deliverability collapse, brand and partner damage,
    stop-sell orders, and costly emergency list rebuilds.

  problem:
    - >-
      Consent evidence is scattered across brokers, forms, contracts, and ESP
      logs.
    - 'Cross-border rules shift by recipient and campaign, increasing risk.'
    - >-
      Suppression lists live in silos—causing violations or costly
      over-suppression.
    - Manual audits drain time and miss details.

      terms.
