leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or spreadsheet-based shift planning leads to 10–20% overstaffing on
      low-demand days and understaffing during peaks (airport surges, events).
    - >-
      Complex, fragmented HOS rules for passenger carriers (federal FMCSA
      passenger-carrier limits, state/local rules, union/overtime policies)
      create high violation risk and admin load.
    - >-
      Last-minute disruptions (flight delays, VIP itinerary changes, traffic)
      cause cascading reassignments that increase overtime costs 8–15% and erode
      on-time performance.
    - >-
      Maintenance windows and inspections are poorly aligned with demand,
      reducing vehicle availability by 5–10% and causing avoidable
      out-of-service conflicts.
    - >-
      Existing limo dispatch tools focus on reservations/dispatch, not
      AI-driven, constraint-based rostering across HOS, maintenance, driver
      preferences, and cost objectives.
  solution:
    - >-
      Direct integrations pull reservations, driver rosters, vehicle status, and
      maintenance plans into a single planning workspace.
    - >-
      Forecast demand at 15–30 minute intervals using bookings, historical ride
      patterns, flight feeds, events calendars, and weather; generate required
      coverage by vehicle class and chauffeur certification.
    - >-
      Compliance engine encodes FMCSA passenger-carrier HOS, state/local rules,
      union contracts, and company policies; flags/blocks noncompliant
      assignments pre-publication.
    - >-
      Constraint optimizer creates cost-minimal rosters respecting HOS, breaks,
      split shifts, vehicle class matching, maintenance windows, driver
      skills/preferences, and geographic constraints.
    - >-
      Real-time replanning reacts to delays/cancellations; proposes swaps that
      avoid violations and control overtime exposure.
    - >-
      Driver app for timekeeping, break prompts, shift bidding, and
      acknowledgement; audit trail for regulators/insurers.
    - >-
      Analytics quantify savings, utilization, forecast accuracy, and compliance
      status; scenario planning to test schedules before publishing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that converts bookings, flight/event data, and maintenance plans into
    HOS-compliant, cost-optimized rosters—cutting overtime 12–18%, preventing
    90%+ violations, and increasing vehicle availability 5–10%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific compliance and rostering engine for passenger-carrier
    operations that unifies HOS rules, flight/event-driven demand, and
    maintenance constraints—trained on cross-operator patterns. The combination
    of specialized rule packs, integrations with industry systems, and
    optimization IP creates switching costs and defensible performance gains not
    matched by generic workforce tools.
