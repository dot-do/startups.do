  problem:
    - >-
      Invoice data for fresh meat is trapped in PDFs/paper; manual keying and AP
      coding causes 2–6% line-item errors and 1–3 day delays in cost updates.
    - >-
      Catch-weight, unit-of-measure, and primal-to-retail conversions are
      complex; costs often fail to sync to POS/ERP SKUs, creating 0.5–1.5%
      margin leakage.
    - >-
      Suppliers substitute items or change pack sizes without notice; stores
      miss price updates and underprice items.
    - >-
      Meat departments lack SKU-level cost and shrink visibility; managers can’t
      quantify yield losses or price creep in time.
    - >-
      Existing OCR/AP tools aren’t meat-specific; they don’t map supplier items
      to PLUs, handle yield, or push real-time price changes to POS/scale
      systems.
  solution:
    - >-
      Meat-optimized OCR and EDI ingestion for invoices, pack lists, and credits
      (PDF/email/photo).
    - >-
      Automated supplier-item to SKU/PLU mapping with learned equivalences,
      pack-size and unit conversions, and catch-weight handling.
    - >-
      Real-time cost sync to POS/ERP and scale systems; auto-recalculate retails
      based on target margins and rules.
    - >-
      Margin leak detection: price change not reflected in retail, supplier
      substitution, variance vs expected yield, shrink anomalies, promo margin
      erosion.
    - >-
      Workflows: AP coding/approvals, exceptions queue, and one-click vendor
      disputes with evidence.
    - >-
      Dashboards: gross margin, cost change history, yield/shrink benchmarks by
      cut/store/period; export to accounting/BI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Digitize meat invoices, auto-map supplier items to store SKUs, sync true
    costs to POS/ERP within minutes, and proactively flag every margin
    leak—catch weight, yield loss, substitutions, and price creep—so fresh
    departments protect 50–150 bps of gross margin without extra headcount.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A meat-specific invoice-to-SKU mapping graph and yield library accumulated
    across suppliers and regions, combined with certified real-time cost push to
    POS/scale systems. This closed-loop dataset improves with each store, raises
    auto-match rates, and is hard for generic OCR/AP tools to replicate.
    Partnerships with POS/scale vendors embed the workflow and increase
    switching costs.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Independent butcher shops (1–5 locations) needing AP automation and margin
      control.
    - >-
      Regional/small-chain grocers (5–100 stores) with in-house meat departments
      and scale labels (primary ICP).
    - >-
      Specialty grocers and food co-ops with high fresh mix and complex vendor
      base.
    - >-
      Central finance/AP teams and category managers controlling meat pricing
      and COGS.
    - Distributors/wholesalers serving independents (as channel partners).
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to regional grocers and butcher chains: outbound to
      CFO/Controller, VP Fresh, Meat Director; ROI-led demos using sample
      invoices.
    - >-
      Partnerships with POS/ERP vendors (ECRS, BRdata, Itasca, NCR) to be listed
      in marketplaces and co-sell to installed bases.
    - >-
      Distributor/wholesaler partnerships (e.g., regional meat distributors)
      offering onboarding to their retail customers; co-marketing and volume
      discounts.
    - >-
      Industry associations and events: NGA Show, Annual Meat Conference
      (NAMI/AFI), provincial/state grocer associations; speaking slots and
      workshops on margin leakage.
    - >-
      Content-led growth: meat margin benchmarks, price creep reports, and
      calculator tools; gated case studies; targeted LinkedIn ads to
      fresh/finance roles.
    - >-
      Referral programs for consultants/integrators serving independent grocers;
      spiffs for successful pilots.
