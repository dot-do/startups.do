  title: Interaction & Contraindication Tagging (Precomputed PDP Warnings)
  description: >-
    Precompute ingredient-level interaction and condition tags so PDPs and cart
    guardrails can display context-sensitive warnings.
  targetUsers:
    - Stores selling condition-adjacent supplements
    - Brands with high-ingredient variability
  triggers:
    - Catalog change
    - Quarterly knowledge refresh
  inputs:
    - Ingredient lists per SKU
    - List of common meds/conditions of interest
    - Severity taxonomy and display rules
  steps:
    - Map ingredients to canonical entities
    - Query knowledge bases for interactions/contraindications
    - Assign severity (info/caution/avoid) with sources
    - Write tags/metafields; expose PDP/widget JSON
    - Monitor for knowledge updates
  tools:
    - RxNorm/MedlinePlus/API
    - 'Optional: DrugBank/Natural Medicines (licensed)'
    - LLM for evidence summarization
    - Shopify metafields/GraphQL
  outputs:
    - Per-SKU interaction tags + sources
    - Display-ready warning snippets
  pricingModel:
    - Setup + per-SKU tagging fee
    - Annual refresh fee

  risks:
    - Source licensing/coverage gaps
    - False positives/negatives causing liability
    - Customer over-reliance on warnings

  problem:
    - >-
      Supplement retailers struggle to reliably map SKUs to accurate ingredient
      lists, dosages, and synonyms, making interaction/contraindication
      detection unreliable.
    - >-
      Customers often lack context on interactions with medications (e.g., blood
      thinners), conditions (e.g., pregnancy, hypertension), allergies, or
      age-related risks at point of purchase.
    - >-
      Existing medical interaction databases are not optimized for retail
      PDPs/cart flows (latency, consumer language, explainability, ecommerce
      integrations), leading to poor adoption.
    - >-
      Legal and compliance risk from insufficient warnings create potential
      liability and brand damage; manual rule maintenance doesn’t scale across
      tens of thousands of SKUs and frequent reformulations.
    - >-
      Retailers lack measurable, controlled ways to balance safety warnings with
      conversion, leading to either over-warning (conversion loss) or
      under-warning (safety gaps).
  solution:
    - >-
      Build and maintain a supplement-focused knowledge graph linking SKUs to
      standardized ingredients, doses, synonyms, and evidence-backed
      interactions/contraindications.
    - >-
      Batch precompute risk tags per SKU (and per typical consumer profiles) to
      enable sub-200ms PDP rendering; provide low-latency API for cart-level
      checks and alternative recommendations.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop pharmacist QA and escalation workflow for edge cases and
      new ingredients; evidence grading and explainable summaries.
    - >-
      SDK/widgets for PDP and cart: context-sensitive warnings, pill
      identifiers, pregnancy/lactation flags, allergy highlights, and
      alternative-safe suggestions.
    - >-
      Integrations with PIMs, ecommerce platforms, and CDPs to ingest product
      data, push tags, and optionally incorporate user-declared conditions/meds
      (privacy-safe).
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard to A/B test warning levels, monitor prevented risky
      carts, and quantify impact on conversion, returns, and CS tickets.
    - >-
      Audit logging, consent and disclaimers, jurisdictional rulepacks
      (US/EU/CA), and legal/compliance templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Precomputed, pharmacist-validated interaction and contraindication tags at
    the ingredient level, delivered as fast PDP widgets and cart guardrails that
    increase consumer trust, reduce safety risk, and require minimal engineering
    effort.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A supplement-specific knowledge graph with pharmacist-curated rules and
    SKU-level mappings continuously refreshed from real retailer catalogs,
    coupled with precomputation for sub-200ms PDP experiences and tight
    ecommerce/PIM integrations. Over time, feedback loops from override logs and
    A/B results create defensible precision and conversion tuning unmatched by
    generic medical databases.
