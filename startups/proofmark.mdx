leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Ammunition manufacturers face a high volume of recurring filings (e.g.,
      Tier II/EPCRA, TRI/Form R, RCRA Biennial, stormwater MSGP, air permits,
      OSHA 300/300A, hazard training logs, ATF explosives storage records) with
      overlapping data requirements and short windows.
    - >-
      Data lives in silos (ERP/MES, lab results, emission monitors, waste
      manifests, training LMS, spreadsheets), requiring 40–120 person-hours per
      filing to consolidate, normalize, validate, and draft forms.
    - >-
      Regulations change frequently (state and federal), creating risk of
      outdated templates and missed new thresholds or reporting categories.
    - >-
      Skilled EHS/compliance labor is scarce; overtime and consultant fees drive
      annual reporting costs into the five–six figures per facility.
    - >-
      Audit prep is reactive; evidence chains, QA trail, and version control are
      fragmented, leading to corrective actions and penalties during third-party
      or regulator audits.
    - >-
      Management lacks visibility into compliance posture (on-time rates, data
      gaps, upcoming deadlines), impeding resource allocation and risk
      management.
    - >-
      Penalties, production interruptions, and brand damage from non-compliance
      or incomplete records can exceed the cost of prevention by multiples.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to systems of record (ERP/MES, HRIS/LMS, LIMS, CEMS/stack data,
      hazardous waste and shipping portals) and ingest historical
      filings/evidence.
    - >-
      Map data to a maintained ammunition-sector regulatory library (federal,
      state, and local) to auto-populate drafts for recurring filings (e.g.,
      TRI, Tier II, RCRA Biennial, stormwater, air, OSHA logs) and assemble
      evidence binders.
    - >-
      Run automated validations (threshold checks, unit conversions,
      mass-balance, cross-form consistency) and flag anomalies or missing
      evidence with suggested remediation steps.
    - >-
      Provide human-in-the-loop workflows: reviewer assignments, redlines,
      approval gates, e-signatures, and auditable change logs.
    - >-
      Package submissions in regulator-ready formats (where e-file is supported)
      and produce audit-ready workpapers, citations, and a defensible QA trail.
    - >-
      Maintain a live calendar of deadlines, permit conditions, training
      expirations, and regulatory change alerts tailored to each site.
    - >-
      After-action analytics quantify time saved, error rates, and audit
      findings to drive continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, ammo-specific regulatory reporting and audit-prep that cuts
    preparation time 60–80%, increases first-pass accuracy, and keeps plants
    continuously audit-ready—while ensuring human review before any submission.
