  problem:
    - >-
      Scrap and regrind rates in EPS/XPS lines commonly run 5–12%, but plants
      lack a consistent, data-driven view of top loss drivers by line, shift,
      and SKU.
    - >-
      Operator notes contain root-cause clues but are unstructured and
      inconsistently captured; valuable tribal knowledge is lost with turnover
      and shift changes.
    - >-
      Root-cause analysis is slow (days/weeks) and reactive; process engineers
      struggle to correlate bead lot, steam/vacuum profiles, mold temperature,
      density targets, and tooling with quality outcomes.
    - >-
      Action follow-through is inconsistent; plants can’t quantify whether
      corrective actions (e.g., steam ramp changes, vent cleaning, bead
      pre-expansion tweaks) actually reduce scrap.
    - >-
      Existing MES/SCADA dashboards show alarms and trends, but not ranked
      causal drivers or impact forecasts; manual Pareto charts miss multivariate
      interactions.
    - >-
      High variability across shifts/crews for identical SKUs; no simple way to
      attribute variance to training, SOP adherence, or upstream conditions.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into regrind mix ratios’ impact on fusion, density
      variation, and compressive strength; quality risks cause rework and
      customer complaints.
    - >-
      Management needs a defensible ROI on CI projects; savings attribution for
      scrap reduction is disputed without controlled experiments or solid
      baselines.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data integration: Connect to PLC/SCADA/MES/ERP (OPC UA, Kepware,
      Wonderware, FactoryTalk, Proficy), historians, SQL/CSV, and lab QA
      systems; ingest bead lot, pre-expansion parameters, mold temperature,
      steam/vacuum curves, density, moisture, line speed, tooling, and regrind
      ratios.
    - >-
      Driver ranking: Multivariate loss decomposition ranks top contributors to
      scrap/regrind by line/shift/SKU using SHAP-based feature attribution and
      time-aligned context (materials, maintenance, ambient humidity).
    - >-
      Operator note intelligence: Cluster and summarize unstructured notes
      (multilingual) to surface recurring themes (e.g., "steam valve sticking
      L3," "vacuum leak M2"), linking to quantified impact.
    - >-
      Recommendations library: Physics-informed playbooks (e.g., pre-expansion
      moisture targets, steam ramp tuning, vent and ejector maintenance
      intervals, regrind mix limits by SKU) mapped to probable causes.
    - >-
      Impact monitoring: Closed-loop experiments (A/B, pre/post with synthetic
      controls) to attribute savings; automatic SPC charts and alerts when KPIs
      drift.
    - >-
      Shift benchmarking: Compare shifts for the same SKU/line; quantify
      training/SOP adherence gaps and suggest targeted coaching.
    - >-
      Quality-risk early warning: Predict out-of-spec density/fusion risk and
      recommend parameter adjustments before scrap occurs.
    - >-
      Executive reporting: Weekly savings report (scrap $, energy $, uptime) and
      payback tracker; audit trail of actions and outcomes for CI governance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut scrap and regrind 10–30% within 90 days by pinpointing top loss drivers
    by line/shift/SKU, turning operator notes into actionable clusters, and
    closing the loop with recommended actions whose impact is automatically
    measured and reported.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Foam-specific data models and action playbooks co-developed with OEMs and
    bead suppliers, a growing cross-plant labeled dataset, prebuilt connectors
    to common EPS/XPS equipment, and a closed-loop savings attribution engine
    that turns actions into auditable ROI—difficult for generic analytics or MES
    vendors to replicate quickly.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Medium–large EPS (expanded polystyrene) block, shape molding, and
      packaging converters (3–10 lines/plant), and XPS (extruded polystyrene)
      insulation board producers.
    - >-
      Buyer roles: VP Operations, Plant Manager, Director of Quality, CI/Lean
      Leader, Process Engineering Manager.
    - >-
      Users: Process engineers, quality engineers, shift supervisors,

    - >-
      Secondary: OEM machinery providers (molders, pre-expanders) seeking
      analytics add-ons; bead suppliers wanting application performance
      visibility for technical service.
  channels:

      Direct sales to VP Ops/Plant Managers via targeted account-based outreach
      to top EPS/XPS converters in NA/EU.

      steam/vacuum tuning for EPS, and regrind risk whitepapers; SEO for “reduce
      EPS scrap,” “XPS quality analytics.”

  character: >-
    Plant managers, process engineers, and CI leaders in polystyrene foam
    manufacturing who need to cut scrap/regrind and protect margins.
  problem: >-
    Scrap and regrind losses hide across lines, shifts, and SKUs; operator notes
    are unstructured; root causes are slow to find; improvement impact isn’t
    measured—resulting in wasted resin, missed OEE, and margin erosion.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam variability. Our AI pinpoints top scrap drivers by
    line/shift/SKU, clusters operator notes into actionable themes, recommends
    proven countermeasures, and monitors impact so teams learn what works.
  plan: >-
    Start simple: 1) Connect production data and operator notes 2) Validate
    insights on a pilot line 3) Act on prioritized recommendations and standard
    work 4) Monitor impact in dashboards and scale plant‑wide.
  callToAction: Book a 30‑minute demo or launch a 4‑week pilot; connect your data in days.
  success: >-
    Lower scrap and regrind, recover resin costs, faster root‑cause cycles,
    standardized playbooks, engaged operators, audited ROI, and steadier quality
    and throughput.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing from spreadsheets, keep firefighting, keep losing resin
    dollars, miss targets, and fall behind competitors.

      Integrations: OPC UA/Modbus, SQL/MES, CSV/S3, REST APIs; on‑prem or VPC
      deployment.
    - 'Security: SSO, RBAC, audit trails, data encryption in transit and at rest.'
  steps:
    - Connect data from MES/SCADA/quality logs and import operator notes.
    - Auto‑baseline 4–6 weeks of history to learn patterns and seasonality.
