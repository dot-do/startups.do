  problem:
    - >-
      Late-stage surprises from Engineering Change Orders (ECOs) propagate
      across multi-level BOMs, suppliers, routings, and service literature,
      driving expedite costs, scrap, and delays.
    - >-
      Impact analysis is manual and siloed across PLM/ERP/MES/SCM/Service
      systems, taking days to weeks and often missing effectivity,
      options/variants, or supplier capacity constraints.
    - >-
      Cost and lead-time impacts of changes are poorly predicted; finance and
      supply chain get notified too late to hedge materials or re-source parts.
    - >-
      Manufacturing work instructions and technical publications lag behind
      approved changes by weeks, increasing rework and service errors.
    - >-
      Regulatory/safety compliance checks (e.g., EU Machinery Regulation, ISO
      4254, emissions) are not consistently embedded in change workflows,
      creating risk of non-compliance.
    - >-
      Fielded installed-base impact by serial number isn’t quantified early,
      leading to unplanned service campaigns and warranty exposure.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to PLM/ERP/MES/SCM/Service systems, build a digital thread
      knowledge graph (EBOM↔MBOM↔routings↔suppliers↔service content) with
      effectivity, options/variants, and serialization.
    - >-
      Run pre-approval AI impact simulations per ECO: cost roll-ups (material,
      labor, overhead), lead-time changes, capacity constraints, tool/fixture
      needs, inventory/WIP disposition, and installed-base effects.
    - >-
      Produce a heatmap and risk score for each ECO (0–100) with drivers:
      long-lead parts, single/sole-sourced components, compliance touchpoints,
      tooling changes, training impact, and service exposure.
    - >-
      Auto-draft and redline manufacturing work instructions, routings, and
      operator training materials; propose updates to service manuals, parts
      catalogs, and bulletins using retrieval-augmented generation tied to
      source PLM objects.
    - >-
      Generate “what-if” scenarios (e.g., supplier re-source, alternate parts,
      design variant) and compare cost/lead-time/quality trade-offs; recommend
      actions with quantified ROI.
    - >-
      Embed rule packs for ag-equipment safety and regulatory checks (ISO 4254,
      ISO 12100, EU Machinery Regulation 2023/1230, CE marking, EPA Tier 4/Stage
      V) into the change workflow.
    - >-
      Push structured impact summaries back to PLM change objects and route
      stakeholders; log decisions and evidence for audit and compliance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven, multi-system impact simulation that predicts and quantifies the
    downstream cost, lead time, supplier, manufacturing, and service
    implications of ECOs across multi-level BOMs—then auto-generates the
    required work instruction and service documentation updates with full
    traceability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A farm-machinery-specific digital thread knowledge graph and compliance rule
    packs, trained on historical ECO outcomes and variant/effectivity patterns,
    combined with deep PLM/ERP/MES integrations and auto-generated
    manufacturing/service documentation with traceable citations—reducing change
    risk faster than horizontal PLM modules can replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Engineering and operations leaders at farm machinery OEMs and Tier‑1s (VP
    Engineering, Change Manager, PLM/ERP Lead) who need to implement engineering
    changes fast without downstream surprises—protecting build schedules,
    compliance, and dealer/customer uptime.
  problem: >-
    ECOs ripple across multi‑level BOMs, suppliers, routings, work instructions,
    and service docs while data sits in PLM/ERP/MES/DMS silos; manual impact
    analysis is slow and error‑prone, creating anxiety about shortages, rework,
    cost creep, and field issues—changes shouldn’t jeopardize farmers’ critical
    uptime.
  guide: >-
    ECO/BOM Impact Analyzer is an AI co‑pilot built by manufacturing data and
    PLM practitioners; it understands complex ag equipment structures and change
    control, integrating with major PLM/ERP systems to provide practical,
    credible guidance instead of more dashboards.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect PLM/ERP/document sources; 2) AI maps cross‑BOM relationships and
    predicts impacts to cost, supply, manufacturing, and service; 3) Review the
    auto‑generated impact brief with mitigation options; 4) Approve with
    confidence and sync updates back to systems. Start with a 2–4 week pilot;
    enterprise security and access controls; no write‑back until approved.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a pilot on your next high‑impact ECO.
    Transitional: Download a sample impact brief and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Right‑first‑time changes: faster ECO cycle time, no surprise line stops,
    controlled costs, supplier readiness at release, auto‑updated work
    instructions and service docs, audit‑ready traceability—resulting in
    smoother launches and happier dealers and farmers.
  failure: >-
    Keep gambling with changes: blind spots cause shortages, expedite costs,
    scrap/rework, missed ship dates, audit gaps, and confused field service
    during critical harvest and planting windows.
