leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Yield loss and customer returns: Undetected or late-detected defects
      (mottle, streaks, gels, pinholes, scratches) commonly cause 1–3% yield
      loss and chargebacks, equating to $0.5–5M per plant per year for
      medium-to-large production volumes.
    - >-
      Manual/legacy inspection gaps: Human or threshold-based systems struggle
      at web speeds of 300–1,200 m/min and miss subtle/low-contrast defects;
      changeovers and new products require manual retuning.
    - >-
      High false positive rates: Generic web inspection systems often generate
      5–20% false alarms, overwhelming operators and reducing trust, causing
      real issues to be ignored.
    - >-
      Slow root-cause analysis: Quality excursions can take 2–6 hours MTTR to
      diagnose without automated correlation to process data (e.g., dryer temps,
      viscosity, tension), prolonging scrap runs.
    - >-
      Poor traceability: Incomplete defect maps to winder/slitter and MES make
      it hard to isolate bad material, increasing rework and risk of shipping
      defects.
    - >-
      Vendor lock-in and retrofit friction: Proprietary WIS stacks make upgrades
      expensive; manufacturers need hardware-agnostic software that leverages
      existing line-scan cameras and PLC/MES.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time, edge-deployed computer vision that detects and classifies
      coating/finishing defects on roll/web images at line speed.
    - >-
      Root-cause analytics engine: correlates defect events with process
      historian tags (e.g., dryer zones, slot-die gap, solution viscosity, web
      tension, pump pulsation, filter ΔP) and recipe parameters to suggest
      likely causes and corrective actions.
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration: streams defect maps to PLC/MES and winder/slitter
      for automated isolation, regrade, and downstream routing (OPC
      UA/Modbus/MQTT/REST).
    - >-
      Continuous learning: operator feedback loop and active learning workflows
      to adapt models per product, coating weight, substrate, and lighting, with
      drift detection and safe model promotion.
    - >-
      Hardware-agnostic deployment: supports common line-scan/camera vendors;
      optional ruggedized edge appliance for plants without sufficient on-prem
      compute.
    - >-
      Services: rapid onboarding (data capture, labeling, calibration), model
      customization, and validation aligned to plant MSA and quality protocols.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    CoatSight AI delivers high-precision, real-time defect detection and
    classification tailored to coating/finishing, plus automated root-cause
    suggestions by correlating images with process historians—reducing scrap
    10–30%, false alarms below 2%, and time-to-diagnosis from hours to minutes,
    all on your existing cameras.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary dataset linking defect images to verified root causes
    across multiple coating chemistries and substrates, combined with

    Documented case studies with measurable scrap reduction and FP rates build
    trust and create a data network effect competitors can’t easily replicate.

  problem:
    - >-
      Defects escape manual inspection and surface late, driving scrap, rework,
      and returns.
    - >-
      Legacy cameras flag anomalies but flood operators with false alarms and no

      dryers, and substrates.
    - High-speed webs and variable lighting break simple thresholding methods.
