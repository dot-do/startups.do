  problem:
    - >-
      Biotech R&D teams without dedicated bioinformatics staff struggle to
      convert raw bulk RNA‑seq and proteomics data into validated, reproducible
      insights quickly.
    - >-
      Current analyses are often non‑reproducible (ad‑hoc scripts, undocumented
      parameters, opaque consultants), risking irreproducible results and
      regulatory/audit challenges.
    - >-
      Turnaround times are unpredictable (days–weeks), delaying project
      milestones and consuming scientist time in coordination and rework.
    - >-
      Pathway enrichment results are inconsistent across tools and databases;
      parameter choices and gene set versions are rarely tracked, reducing
      trust.
    - >-
      Data governance and security requirements (PHI/PII, IP, audit logs,
      chain‑of‑custody) are not met by many point tools or freelancers.
    - >-
      Biotech startups need interpretation support (biological narratives,
      hypotheses) alongside statistics; internal teams lack capacity to generate
      explainable summaries for non‑bioinformatics stakeholders.
    - >-
      Costs are opaque; per‑project quotes vary widely with hidden compute and
      reanalysis charges.
    - >-
      Proteomics pipelines (MaxQuant/FragPipe) and RNA‑seq pipelines are siloed,
      making cross‑omics interpretation cumbersome.
  solution:
    - >-
      End‑to‑end, containerized pipelines (Nextflow/CWL) for bulk RNA‑seq
      (STAR/Salmon + DESeq2/edgeR/limma) and proteomics (MaxQuant/FragPipe +
      MSstats/limma) with fully captured parameters and environment hashes.
    - >-
      Automated QC (FastQC/MultiQC for RNA‑seq; LFQ QC metrics for proteomics)
      and covariate modeling (batch effects, confounders) with pre‑registered
      analysis plans.
    - >-
      Standardized differential expression and enrichment (ORA, GSEA, ssGSEA)
      using curated, version‑locked gene sets (MSigDB, Reactome, KEGG; licensed
      as needed) with provenance and timestamps.
    - >-
      Interactive, shareable Jupyter/Quarto notebooks that regenerate results on
      rerun (deterministic, seed‑locked), accompanied by PDF and HTML exports
      for reports/boards.
    - >-
      AI‑assisted interpretation: evidence‑linked summaries, key pathways,
      upstream regulators, and candidate biomarkers with citations and caveats;
      human‑in‑the‑loop sign‑off.
    - >-
      APIs and secure portals for data upload (FASTQ/mzML/counts), job
      orchestration, and delivery; SSO, RBAC, audit trails, WORM exports for
      compliance.
    - >-
      SLA‑backed delivery: e.g., RNA‑seq (≤48 samples; 50M reads/sample) in 48
      hours from upload; proteomics (≤24 samples) in 72 hours; expedited tiers
      available.
    - >-
      Cross‑omics concordance layer to align RNA‑seq and proteomics signals at
      gene/pathway level with consistent QC and confidence scoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reproducible, audited bulk RNA‑seq and proteomics analysis delivered in
    hours—not weeks—via transparent, versioned notebooks and validated
    pipelines, with explainable AI interpretations and enterprise‑grade
    security.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A rigorously validated, audit‑ready stack that couples deterministic
    pipelines with transparent notebooks and an explainable AI interpretation
    layer, plus CRO and cloud marketplace distribution that embeds ODEA at the
    point of sequencing purchase.

  character: >-
    Biotech R&D scientists, bioinformaticians, and PI-led teams who need
    trustworthy, reproducible bulk RNA-seq/proteomics differential expression
    and pathway enrichment to make decisions fast.
  problem: >-
    External: Fragmented pipelines, inconsistent QC/DE, opaque parameters, and
    slow turnarounds stall R&D. Internal: Teams worry results won’t replicate,
    won’t withstand peer review/audit, and deadlines slip. Philosophical:
    High-stakes science should be transparent, reproducible, and explainable—not
    a black box.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve lived the pain of count matrices, batch effects, and reviewer
    #2. Authority: Validated DE/enrichment methods (e.g., DESeq2/edgeR, limma,
    GSEA/ORA), standardized QC, version-locked containers, and transparent
    Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks with full provenance; references and case
    studies available; built for NAICS 541714 R&D environments.
  plan: >-
    1) Discovery call and data/privacy agreement. 2) Securely upload counts +
    metadata or connect S3/GCS; define contrasts, covariates, and batch factors.
    3) We run a reproducible pipeline (QC, normalization, DE, pathway
    enrichment) and deliver a transparent notebook, HTML report, and
    machine-readable outputs; review and iterate. Optional: set up CI/CD and
    hand off templates to your team.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a pilot analysis (1 dataset, ~2-week turnaround). Transitional:
    Download a sample notebook/report, request the QC/DE checklist, or get
    pricing.
  success: >-
    Clear, defensible results with full provenance; reviewer-ready figures;
    faster go/no-go decisions; reduced analysis time and rework; cross-study
    comparability; FAIR-friendly outputs; stronger grant/manuscript acceptance;
    better target/biomarker prioritization.
  failure: >-
    Without this: wasted sequencing budgets, irreproducible findings, missed
    mechanisms/targets, delayed submissions and trials, audit exposure, and
    teams stuck babysitting brittle scripts.
