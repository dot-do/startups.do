leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers rely on spreadsheets/ERP heuristics that ignore finite
      capacity, causing unrealistic daily/weekly plans and late orders.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent setups (yarn type, color/dye lot, needle/gauge, fabric
      width, cut-plan nesting, seam operations) create excessive changeovers and
      lost runtime.
    - >-
      Frequent rush orders, rework, and machine unplanned downtime break plans;
      re-scheduling is slow and manual (hours instead of minutes).
    - >-
      Due-date promises are made without realistic capacity checks (no
      capable-to-promise), driving penalties and expediting costs.
    - >-
      Labor and skill constraints (operator qualifications, sewing team
      balancing) are not modeled, leading to bottlenecks and overtime.
    - >-
      Disconnected ERP/MES/BOM/routing data and poor data hygiene impede usable
      schedules and KPI tracking.
    - >-
      High WIP, long queues, and material shortages (yarn/trim/elastic/zippers)
      cause underutilization and poor OTD performance.
    - >-
      Industrial customers demand schedule adherence and traceability; failure
      affects renewals and brand reputation.
  solution:
    - >-
      Textile-specific finite-capacity optimization engine modeling machines,
      tools, labor skills, shifts, maintenance, and sequence-dependent
      setups/changeovers.
    - >-
      Rapid re-scheduling in minutes when rush orders or breakdowns occur;
      preserves stability with minimal necessary changes.
    - >-
      Capable-to-promise (order-slotting) that checks true
      capacity/material/skill availability before confirming due dates.
    - >-
      What-if scenarios: compare schedule alternatives (e.g., color-batching vs
      delivery date) with KPI deltas (OTD, WIP, setups, overtime).
    - >-
      Closed-loop integration with ERP/MES (Datatex, SAP, Infor, Microsoft
      Dynamics) for orders, routings, BOMs, inventories, and completion
      feedback.
    - >-
      Dashboards: OTD forecast, schedule adherence, utilization, setup hours,
      lateness risk by order, planner workload.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly dispatch lists by line/machine, with digital
      acknowledgments and exception alerts.
    - >-
      Data quality assistant: flags missing routings, incorrect cycle times, or
      outdated setup matrices; learns setup durations from history.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-powered finite-capacity scheduler tailored to textile mills that
    generates feasible, shop-floor-ready daily/weekly plans in minutes—reducing
    changeovers, increasing OTD, and unlocking fast, reliable
    capable-to-promise.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Textile-first APS with pre-built sequence and skill models (yarn/dye
    lot/needle gauge/cut nesting/SMV) and connectors to Datatex/Infor/SAP,
    enabling a 4–6 week pilot and measurable KPI lift. Proprietary setup-time
    prediction and batching policies trained on textile datasets deliver lower
    changeovers than generic APS tools—validated via benchmark cases.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Production planner or operations manager at an All Other Miscellaneous
    Textile Product Mill who needs a finite‑capacity schedule across looms,
    knitting, cutting, and sewing that ships on time without constant
    firefighting.
  problem: >-
    External: Tight due dates, sequence‑dependent setups/changeovers, limited
    machines and crews, rush orders, and mix changes make schedules infeasible.
    Internal: Spreadsheets and tribal knowledge leave planners reactive and
    unsure what to run next. Philosophical: People doing quality work shouldn’t
    be punished by chaotic, opaque schedules.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the daily reality of re‑sequencing looms and sewing
    lines to chase dates while minimizing changeovers. Authority: Our AI
    scheduler models textile‑specific constraints (machine capabilities,
    calendars, setup matrices) and delivers explainable, audit‑ready plans that
    integrate with your ERP/MES.
  plan: >-
    Process plan: 1) Connect—import orders, routings, machines, setup matrices,
    calendars, and due dates. 2) Schedule—run finite‑capacity optimization;
    compare scenarios; lock priorities and constraints. 3) Execute—publish to
    the floor; track progress; one‑click reschedule when things change.
    Agreement plan: start with a pilot line; transparent logic and data
    ownership; simple, cancel‑anytime subscription after proof of value.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo or start a 14‑day pilot using your real
    orders. Transitional: Download the Textile Scheduling Playbook and try the
    ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Reliable daily/weekly plans; higher on‑time delivery; increased machine
    utilization; fewer changeovers and overtime; clear operator priorities;
    credible promise dates for sales; calmer planners and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Missed due dates, expedited freight, idle or bottlenecked machines, excess
    overtime, long changeovers, floor chaos, margin erosion, and lost customers.
