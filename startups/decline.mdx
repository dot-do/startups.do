  problem:
    - >-
      Engineers spend 40–60% of their time on manual DCA fitting and rollups; a
      typical engineer processes 15–30 wells/day by hand. Large operators manage
      5,000–50,000 wells, making current workflows slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Forecast quality varies by engineer; deterministic fits with inconsistent
      constraints lead to 5–15% MAPE vs next-month actuals and frequent rework
      during reserves and budget cycles.
    - >-
      Rollups for areas/DSUs/assets take 1–3 weeks per cycle due to fragmented
      data (ARIES/PHDWin, Spotfire/Excel, SCADA/PI) and lack of automated
      lineage and audit trails.
    - >-
      Scenario analysis (price, downtime, choke/pressure, refrac/LOE changes) is
      limited; teams typically evaluate <5 scenarios/asset per cycle due to time
      constraints, missing optionality in planning.
    - >-
      Uncertainty quantification is underused; many teams report single
      deterministic cases (one curve/one price deck) and cannot produce
      P10/P50/P90 distributions with traceable assumptions on demand.
    - >-
      Reserves auditors and RBL lenders require reproducibility, yet current
      toolchains lack versioned forecasts, constraint transparency, and change
      logs, causing 10–20% cycle time in back-and-forth.
    - >-
      Data QC is laborious; misallocated volumes, completions changes, shut-ins,
      meter swaps, and workover flags are not automatically detected, causing
      biased decline parameters.
    - >-
      IT and Security require SOC 2/ISO alignment and SSO; many forecasting
      tools are desktop or siloed, creating governance and data egress risks.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated DCA engine using physics-informed ML that fits Arps/Modified
      Arps/SEPD with constraint libraries (b, Di, Dmin, terminal decline) tuned
      by reservoir/landing zone and choke/pressure regimes.
    - >-
      Bulk forecasting and rollups that process 10,000+ wells/hour on cloud,
      producing PDP/PDNP/PUD cases with P10/P50/P90; lineage and change logs
      preserved for audit.
    - >-
      Scenario manager to evaluate price decks, LOE, downtime, choke schedules,
      refracs/COMBO completions, and CAPEX timing across assets with batch
      compare and delta economics.
    - >-
      Type curve generation by clustering (completion design, geology, landing
      zone, machine-learned ‘families’) with automatic outlier detection and
      re-fitting rules.
    - >-
      QC automation: detects shut-ins, allocation anomalies, meter changes, frac
      hits, artificial lift changes; flags segments for human-in-the-loop
      approval via a guided review queue.
    - >-
      One-click exports and bi-directional integrations with ARIES, PHDWin,
      ComboCurve, and Power BI/Spotfire; REST and Python SDK for data
      scientists.
    - >-
      Governance: versioned models, locked price decks, approval workflows, SSO,
      RBAC, SOC 2 controls, and immutable audit logs aligned to SEC/PRMS
      reporting expectations.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS (VPC isolation) or private cloud/on-prem
      for data-sensitive operators; cloud marketplace procurement for simplified
      vendor onboarding.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Audit-ready, physics-informed AI that auto-fits decline curves, generates
    uncertainty-aware forecasts, and delivers traceable rollups in hours instead
    of weeks—integrated with ARIES/PHDWin and accepted by reserves workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Combination of physics-informed ML tuned by basin with a curated QC
    heuristics library, audit-grade governance (versioning, approvals, immutable
    logs), and early partnerships with reserves auditors that accelerate
    acceptance and reduce audit friction. The result is automation at scale with
    traceability trusted by engineering managers and auditors.
