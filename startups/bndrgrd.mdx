  problem:
    - >-
      Operators risk fines, permit suspensions, and lawsuits from unintentional
      mining activity outside permitted boundaries or within sensitive buffers
      (wetlands, streams, property setbacks).
    - >-
      Manual monitoring (periodic field inspections, ad‑hoc drone flights)
      misses fast changes and is costly for remote/multi‑site portfolios.
    - >-
      Current satellite monitoring tools are generic; they do not ingest permit
      polygons/buffers or produce regulator‑ready evidence, leading to high
      false positives and low usability for compliance teams.
    - >-
      Cloud cover and seasonal changes (vegetation cycles, flooding) create
      noisy signals and overwhelm small compliance teams with false alerts.
    - >-
      Regulators struggle to prioritize inspections across thousands of sites;
      they need triage signals to focus on likely violations.
    - >-
      Boundary datasets (permits, parcels) live in disparate systems (PDFs, GIS)
      and are hard to maintain, causing misalignment between field reality and
      approved limits.
    - >-
      Stakeholders (landowners, insurers, ESG auditors) require standardized,
      auditable monitoring records; most operators lack a consistent, defensible
      process.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI change detection on Sentinel‑2/Landsat and optional commercial imagery
      to identify bare‑earth expansion, new haul roads, stockpile growth, and
      vegetation removal.
    - >-
      Permit-aware analytics: ingest permit polygons (Shapefile/GeoJSON) and
      auto-generate buffer zones for wetlands/streams/property lines; compute
      overstep area and nearest sensitive feature distance.
    - >-
      Alerting with severity scores and evidence packs (before/after imagery,
      detection polygons, measurements, timestamps) suitable for regulator
      communication.
    - >-
      Cloud/SAR fallback (Sentinel‑1, optional commercial SAR) to reduce
      cloud‑related blind spots and shorten mean time to alert.
    - >-
      Esri ArcGIS Online/Pro integration, webhooks, and APIs for embedding into
      existing GIS/EMS workflows.
    - >-
      Monthly compliance reports plus on-demand incident investigations with
      task tracking and audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Catch boundary and buffer violations within days, not months—automated,
    regulator‑ready monitoring for sand & gravel pits that turns satellite

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and compliance leaders at sand and gravel pits who must keep
    extraction inside permits and protect sensitive buffers while hitting
    production targets.
  problem: >-
    Earthmoving changes fast—stakes move, crews rotate, and small overruns go
    unnoticed. Encroachment beyond permitted boundaries or into buffers risks
    fines, stop-work orders, and reputational damage.
  guide: >-
    We understand how hard it is to oversee multiple pits with lean teams. Our
    remote-sensing and compliance experts pair recent satellite imagery with AI
    change detection to watch your permit lines and buffers continuously.
  plan: >-
    1) Provide permit polygons and buffer distances (or we digitize them). 2) We
    monitor new satellite scenes and run AI change detection near boundaries. 3)
    You get clear alerts and a live risk map to verify. 4) Take action and
    export time-stamped reports for auditors and regulators.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 15-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot with your sites (free risk
    snapshot for one permit).
  success: >-
    Early warnings prevent violations, audits are clean, buffers stay protected,
    reporting is fast, legal and reclamation costs drop, community trust grows,
    and permits remain in good standing while meeting production goals.
  failure: >-
    Without proactive monitoring, overruns are caught late—triggering fines,
    stop-work orders, costly remediation, litigation, bond claims, and lasting
    damage to reputation and permit viability.

    title: Permit Boundary & Encroachment Monitoring for Sand & Gravel Mines
    subtitle: >-
      AI change‑detection on recent satellite imagery flags activity outside
      permits and near sensitive buffers—built for Construction Sand & Gravel
      (NAICS 212321).

    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Boundary creep goes unnoticed until it becomes a violation or shutdown.
    - Manual site checks and drones miss changes between visits.
    - 'Permit maps, buffers, and active operations fall out of sync.'
    - Multi‑site oversight overwhelms lean compliance teams.
    - Evidence for auditors and regulators is scattered and hard to verify.
  solution:
    - Continuously monitor all permitted sites with fresh satellite imagery.
    - AI pinpoints new disturbances outside boundaries and within buffer zones.
    - 'Instant alerts with coordinates, snapshots, and acreage deltas.'
    - Audit‑ready timelines show exactly when and where changes occurred.
    - >-
      Seamless integration of permit polygons and buffer layers for one source
      of truth.
  features:
    - 'Near‑real‑time imagery ingestion (daily to weekly, region‑dependent).'
    - >-
      Change detection tuned for sand & gravel signatures (pits, stockpiles,
      haul roads).
    - >-
      Configurable buffers: wetlands, riparian zones, setbacks,
      cultural/cultural resources.
    - Permit polygon management with version control and history.
    - 'Portfolio dashboard with risk scoring, trend lines, and heat maps.'
    - 'Alerts via email, SMS, and webhooks; API for GIS/EHS/ERP systems.'
    - >-
      On‑map evidence: before/after imagery, outlines, and measurable
      footprints.
    - >-
      False‑positive reduction using ML plus rules for clouds, vegetation, and
      shadows.
    - >-
      One‑click export of audit packets (PDF/GeoJSON) with timestamps and
      coordinates.
    - 'User roles, SSO support, and encrypted data in transit/at rest.'
    - Data retention policies aligned to regulatory record‑keeping needs.
    - Global coverage with localized parameters for state and county rules.
  steps:
    - Upload or sync permit boundaries and buffer layers from your GIS.
    - Set monitoring frequency and customizable alert thresholds.
    - System scans new imagery and detects out‑of‑bounds or near‑buffer changes.
    - 'Receive alerts with map links, snapshots, and measured impact areas.'
    - 'Review findings, annotate, and assign corrective actions to site teams.'
    - Export an audit report or push events to your compliance systems.
