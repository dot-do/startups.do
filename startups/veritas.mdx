  title: Transaction Monitoring Alert Triage & Case Summaries
  description: >-
    Prioritizes alerts, clusters similar activity, recommends dispositions, and
    drafts case narratives for investigators.
  targetUsers:
    - AML investigators
    - FCC/FinCrime ops
    - TM model owners

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High false-positive rates (90–98%) in TM systems drive excessive manual
      alert handling and overtime costs.
    - >-
      Investigators spend 30–60 minutes per alert; narratives are inconsistent,
      error-prone, and difficult to audit against FFIEC/FinCEN expectations.
    - >-
      Backlogs cause SLA breaches and increase regulatory risk (Matters
      Requiring Attention, consent orders).
    - >-
      Duplicate/similar alerts across accounts/branches are handled separately,
      wasting 20–35% of investigator time.
    - >-
      Existing systems lack explainability, robust audit trails, and
      documentation required by SR 11-7/OCC 2011-12 for model governance.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (core banking, KYC, watchlists, TM cases) hinders
      contextual analysis and consistent dispositions.
    - >-
      Banks face hiring and retention challenges; scaling teams linearly with
      alert volume is cost-prohibitive.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI triage scoring to prioritize alerts by risk and investigative value,
      with reason codes and confidence scores.
    - >-
      Similarity clustering across alerts, accounts, and entities to eliminate
      duplicate work; bulk actions with human-in-the-loop review.
    - >-
      Disposition recommendations (close, escalate, investigate further) with
      transparent evidence and policy-aligned rationales.
    - >-
      Auto-drafted case narratives mapped to FFIEC and FinCEN SAR guidance;
      editable templates per bank policy.
    - >-
      Full auditability: versioned models, features, prompts, reviewer
      overrides, and explainability artifacts for MRM.
    - >-
      Plug-in connectors to major TM/case management tools and data sources
      (KYC, watchlists, core banking).
    - >-
      Deployment in bank VPC/on-prem with BYO key management; data never used
      for model training without explicit approval.
    - >-
      Real-time dashboards and SLA monitors for backlog, productivity, and model
      performance; continuous learning with guardrails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut AML alert handling time by 40–60% and reduce backlogs by clustering,
    prioritizing, and auto-drafting regulator-ready case narratives—backed by
    bank-grade explainability, audit trails, and SR 11-7-compliant model
    documentation.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Bank-grade model governance and auditability (SR 11-7-compliant
    documentation pack) combined with pre-built integrations to leading TM
    systems and a proprietary corpus of high-quality, policy-aligned AML
    narratives—enabling faster approvals from MRM and regulators and materially
    shorter time-to-value than generic AI vendors.

  character: >-
    Commercial bank BSA/AML operations leaders and investigators (NAICS 522110)
    who need to triage transaction monitoring alerts faster, more consistently,
    and with audit‑ready narratives.
  problem: >-
    - External: Bursts of alerts, high false positives, fragmented data, and
    tight SAR deadlines.

    - Internal: Investigator fatigue and fear of missing risk or failing an
    exam.

    - Philosophical: Time should be spent assessing risk—not copying data and
    writing boilerplate.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve sat in AML ops and through exams; we know the pressure and
    scrutiny. Authority: Built with ex‑bank AML leaders and model risk experts;
    explainable AI with full audit trails; secure deployment (cloud or on‑prem)
    aligned to BSA/AML expectations.
  plan: >-
    Process:

    1) Connect TM, KYC, and case data via secure adapters.

    2) Configure policies and risk signals; calibrate on historical cases.

    3) AI prioritizes alerts, clusters similar activity, recommends
    dispositions, and drafts case narratives.

    4) Investigators review/approve in your case manager; feedback continuously
    improves models.

    Agreement:

    - Human‑in‑the‑loop; you stay in control.

    - Explainable recommendations; every decision traceable.

    - Security, privacy, and model documentation provided upfront.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30‑minute demo; start a 4‑week pilot on real alerts.
    Transitional: Get the capabilities brief and sample narratives; request
    security and model risk documentation.
  success: >-
    - Reduced alert backlog and stable handling of surges without adding
    headcount.

    - Higher investigator throughput and consistent, examiner‑ready narratives.

    - Faster SAR decisions and improved risk coverage.

    - Lower cost per case and stronger analyst morale.
  failure: |-
    - Growing backlogs, missed risk, and inconsistent narratives.
    - Examiner findings, MRAs/consent‑order risk, and rising operating costs.
    - Burnout and turnover across AML operations.
