leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High-mix/low-volume jobs with long, variable cycle times lead to chronic
      schedule slippage and late deliveries.
    - >-
      Manual whiteboards/Excel or generic ERP schedulers fail to model real
      constraints: shared cranes/fixtures, sequence-dependent setups, WPS/WPQ
      labor qualifications, NDE availability, paint booth cure and environmental
      limits.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime, rework, engineering changes, material delays, and rush
      orders cause firefighting and unstable schedules.
    - >-
      Bottlenecks shift between weld, NDE, and paint, driving overtime, WIP
      buildup, expediting, and margin erosion.
    - >-
      Lack of forward visibility into resource conflicts (e.g., crane time,
      fit-up bays) creates idle time and unbalanced utilization.
    - >-
      Estimating/sales lack reliable promise dates, creating credibility issues
      with customers and penalties on late deliveries.
    - >-
      Existing APS/ERP tools are either too generic, expensive to implement, or
      require heavy manual maintenance to stay accurate.
  solution:
    - >-
      Finite-capacity, constraint-based Gantt across rolling, fit-up, weld, NDE,
      paint, blast, cure, hydrotest, and ship, with shared-resources (overhead
      cranes, fixtures, bays, inspectors).
    - >-
      Domain constraints: sequence-dependent setup (material thickness, process,
      wire change), welder qualifications (WPS/WPQ), joint type, PWHT/external
      services, queue and lot-splitting rules, paint/coat cure times with
      environmental windows.
    - >-
      What-if scenario sandbox: simulate rush orders, breakdowns, overtime/shift
      changes, inspector vacation, material slippage; compare KPIs before/after.
    - >-
      Rapid rescheduling on disruption with schedule stability controls
      (minimize churn) and lock/soft-lock options for released jobs.
    - >-
      Predictive KPIs: forecast OTD, bottlenecks, WIP, crane utilization,
      inspector loading; early warnings for conflicts and missed milestones
      (e.g., hydrotest dates).
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box ERP/MES connectors (Epicor, Infor CSI/SyteLine,
      JobBOSS/ECI, Global Shop Solutions, SAP B1), plus CSV/API imports for
      routings, BOM, labor, and inventory.
    - >-
      Mobile-friendly dispatch lists and traveler visibility for supervisors;
      color-coded Gantt by constraint and status.
    - >-
      AI-assisted time standards calibration using historical actuals (e.g.,
      weld inches/hrs, NDE methods) with human-in-the-loop approvals.
    - >-
      Automated promise-date engine (CTP/ATP) for estimating and order-entry
      with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Audit trail and quality tie-ins: ensure required NDE hold points and
      documentation intervals are respected in the schedule.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific, constraint-based scheduling that understands
    Rolling–Fit-Up–Weld–NDE–Paint. Improve on-time delivery by 10–25%, cut
    planner time 50–70%, and raise throughput 5–12% by modeling real shop
    constraints (cranes, WPS/WPQ, NDE, paint cure) and providing fast, credible
    what-if scenarios.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific constraints engine and dataset tailored to heavy-gauge
    tanks—covering WPS/WPQ, crane/fixture contention, NDE/paint realities—plus
    prebuilt ERP connectors and proven playbooks that deliver measurable OTD and
    throughput gains within 30–45 days. Early customer case studies and
    association partnerships create defensible credibility and switching costs.

  character: >-
    Production schedulers and operations leaders in heavy-gauge metal tank
    manufacturing (NAICS 332420) coordinating Rolling-Fit-Up-Weld-NDE-Paint
    across bays, cranes, fixtures, inspectors, and crews.
  problem: >-
    Firefighting and missed dates: crane/bay conflicts, bottlenecks at
    weld/NDE/paint, stalled WIP, unreliable promise dates, and overtime—because
    spreadsheets and basic ERP dispatching can’t model real constraints or run
    what-if scenarios.
  guide: >-
    Production Schedule Optimizer—an AI scheduling service built for tank
    fabrication—creates a living, constraint-based Gantt with shop-floor
    feedback. We understand WPS, NDE availability, cure times, and crane/fixture
    logic.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect ERP/MRP and routings; 2) Map resources, calendars, and
    constraints (bays, cranes, fixtures, crews, inspectors, booths); 3) Build
    the constraint-based master schedule; 4) Run what-if scenarios (rush jobs,
    downtime, staffing); 5) Publish the live Gantt to planners/cells; 6) Review
    KPIs and refine weekly.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 30-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot to see your plant scheduled
    end-to-end within days.
  success: >-
    Predictable, on-time delivery; 10–20% more throughput without extra shifts;
    shorter lead times; fewer hot jobs; clear promise dates; synchronized
    Rolling-Fit-Up-Weld-NDE-Paint; confident what-if decisions.
  failure: >-
    Missed ship dates, expediting and overtime burn, stalled WIP,
    inspector/booth bottlenecks, rework from poor sequencing, and ongoing blame
    cycles.
