leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Mixed-OEM fleets create data silos (CAT, Komatsu, Volvo, Deere, Liebherr,
      Sandvik, Metso). Operations lack a single source of truth to act on idle,
      maintenance, and utilization.
    - >-
      Idle time commonly exceeds 30–45% of engine hours in sand/gravel pits,
      driving unnecessary fuel burn, DPF issues, and warranty risk.
    - >-
      Maintenance is largely time-based or reactive; unplanned downtime halts
      crushing/screening trains and loaders, causing missed production targets
      and rush part orders.
    - >-
      Superintendents and maintenance managers struggle to convert telematics
      alerts into scheduled work orders and shift-specific actions.
    - >-
      Fuel and emissions reporting for ESG/customer audits is manual,
      error-prone, and disconnected from production (tons).
    - >-
      Low/no cellular coverage at pits delays data sync and reduces trust in
      telematics.
    - >-
      Operator behavior variance (shift to shift, seasonal) is high and training
      is untargeted.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified telematics ingestion from major OEM APIs with automatic asset
      matching and normalization.
    - >-
      AI-driven predictive maintenance (engines, hydraulics, powertrain) using
      operating context (load, temps, pressure proxies, duty cycle) to forecast
      failures 7–30 days out.
    - >-
      Idle reduction playbooks: asset- and shift-specific goals, operator
      coaching cues, and automatic shut-down policy suggestions based on
      production windows.
    - >-
      Work-order automation: push recommendations into CMMS (Fiix, UpKeep,
      eMaint, Maintenance Connection) with estimated labor hours, parts lists,
      and latest OEM service intervals.
    - >-
      Fuel and emissions analytics: fuel/ton, idle gallons, CO2e by pit/shift;
      PDF/CSV exports for audits and bids.
    - >-
      Offline-first edge collector (optional) to cache data where coverage is
      poor and sync when connected.
    - Parts lead-time integration to sequence PMs and reduce wait-time downtime.
    - >-
      ROI tracking dashboard tying interventions to dollar savings and
      production outcomes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce idle fuel burn 15–30% and unplanned downtime 10–20% in 90 days by
    unifying OEM telematics into actionable maintenance predictions and

    hardware.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Aggregates-specific datasets and models that account for load–haul–dump

  character: >-
    Quarry and pit operations leaders who need to keep mixed fleets productive,
    cut idle/fuel, and control maintenance costs.
  problem: >-
    Villain: avoidable idle and hidden machine health issues. External:
    fragmented OEM telematics and reactive maintenance cause downtime and fuel
    waste. Internal: teams feel blind and overwhelmed by alarms. Philosophical:
    heavy iron should work smart, not sit burning diesel.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: we understand the pressure of keeping loaders, haulers, and
    crushers running safely and on budget. Authority: AI built for heavy
    equipment; integrates with OEM telematics (AEMP 2.0/ISO 15143-3); proven
    analytics aligned to PM best practices.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect OEM feeds; 2) Baseline idle and health; 3) Predict
    failures and set right-time PMs; 4) Auto-schedule tasks and operator prompts
    (optional CMMS sync); 5) Review weekly results. Agreement: transparent data
    use, security-first, month-to-month, start with a pilot.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo or launch a 60-day pilot. Transitional:
    Download the Idle Reduction Playbook and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Predictable uptime, measurable idle reduction, lower fuel and maintenance
    cost per ton, on-time PM compliance, fewer breakdowns, engaged operators,
    and confident bids backed by data.
  failure: >-
    Unplanned downtime, wasted fuel, missed PMs, rushed repairs, excess
    emissions and noise, frustrated crews, and uncompetitive cost per ton.
