leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High cost-to-serve: average live-agent interaction $7–$15; truck roll
      $120–$200. 25–40% of tickets are simple setup/misuse issues that could be
      resolved remotely.
    - >-
      Unnecessary RMAs/returns: 10–15% of returned items are “no fault found,”
      creating reverse logistics and refurbishment costs and reducing resale
      value.
    - >-
      Fragmented device ecosystem: rental fleets span 30+ brands and dozens of
      models with inconsistent telemetry and diagnostic tools; agents lack a
      unified view.
    - >-
      Long time-to-resolution (TTR): baseline 12–48 hours; first contact
      resolution (FCR) inconsistent due to agent turnover and limited product
      training.
    - >-
      SLA and churn risk: missed repair windows cause NPS drops and early
      cancellations; lack of proactive alerts reduces chances to fix issues
      before failure.
    - >-
      Limited data feedback loop: troubleshooting steps, telemetry, and outcomes
      aren’t systematically captured to improve future triage accuracy.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified telemetry ingestion across brands/models via SDKs, APIs, and edge
      connectors; fallbacks for non-connected devices using guided symptom
      capture.
    - >-
      LLM-powered chat/voice assistant for customers and agents that diagnoses
      issues, runs safe remote actions (reboot, firmware check), and generates
      step-by-step guidance with visual aids.
    - >-
      Automated decisioning to schedule field service, create RMAs, or ship
      swap/loaner devices when remote fix fails; integrates with dispatch and
      logistics partners.
    - >-
      Proactive monitoring and anomaly detection to flag likely failures (e.g.,
      overheat patterns, battery degradation) and push preventative steps or
      parts pre-ordering.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: capture telemetry, steps taken, outcomes, and parts
      used to continuously tune triage accuracy and parts predictions.
    - >-
      Agent co-pilot inside CRM to summarize history, recommend fixes, estimate
      RMA likelihood, and draft customer communications.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI triage that combines device telemetry with guided chat/voice to resolve
    30–50% of issues remotely, reduce truck rolls by 20–35%, cut average handle
    time by 25–40%, and automate next steps (parts, dispatch, or RMA) — all in a
    single, rental-focused workflow.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, cross-OEM dataset of telemetry + troubleshooting steps +
    outcomes specific to rental workflows (swap, loaner, chargeback), enabling
    higher triage accuracy and parts prediction than generic CX chatbots or
    single-OEM tools. Prebuilt connectors and device ontologies accelerate
    time-to-value and create a defensible data network effect.
