    modelCapability: 9
    overall: 9
  risks:
    - Incorrect depth/clearance data causing incidents
    - 'Unmodeled constraints (e.g., windage)'

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Event and peak-weekend slip assignments are done with
      spreadsheets/whiteboards, causing conflicts (overdraft, over-beam, power
      mismatch) and last‑minute reshuffles
    - >-
      High inbound call/ radio traffic from captains during arrivals because
      instructions change, leading to congestion and safety risk
    - >-
      Under-utilization of inventory on peak days (empty/blocked slips,
      double-booking buffers) reduces revenue by 3–10%
    - >-
      Complex constraints (LOA, beam, draft, tide windows, power/amp, side-to
      tie, group proximity, yacht club priority, ADA access, fuel dock
      restrictions) are hard to manage manually at scale
    - >-
      Last‑minute changes (no‑shows, late arrivals, weather shifts) require
      rapid re-optimization that staff can’t do in real time
    - >-
      Lack of auditability for why a vessel was assigned to a slip (disputes
      with VIPs, member priority)
    - >-
      Existing marina software focuses on reservations, not high-density,
      constraint-based allocation for spikes like regattas/rallies
  solution:
    - >-
      AI/OR constraint solver that ingests marina layout, slip attributes, and
      vessel manifests to auto‑assign conflict‑free berths
    - >-
      Scenario planning: run multiple what‑if plans (weather, staggered ETAs,
      VIP priority) and pick the best
    - >-
      Fast replanning: adjust for late arrivals/no‑shows in under 30 seconds
      with minimal ripple effects
    - >-
      Communication hub: push SMS/email/app instructions, dock diagrams, and QR
      codes to captains and dockhands; live map for arrivals
    - >-
      Rule library for marinas: saved constraint templates (draft by fairway,
      power draw limits, side-to tie by finger length, noise curfew zones)
    - >-
      Integrations with leading marina PMS/reservation tools and regatta
      management systems for vessel manifests and status updates
    - >-
      Audit trail and reporting: who moved where and why; utilization, conflict
      rate, staff effort saved
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn chaotic event and peak‑day dock plans into conflict‑free,
    high‑utilization assignments in minutes, with one‑click re‑plans when things
    change. Increase peak‑day revenue and safety while cutting staff hours.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

    Marina managers and dockmasters coordinating regattas, rallies, and
    peak-weekend traffic.
  problem: >-
    External: hundreds of arrivals with different LOA/beam/draft/power, group
    requests, tides, and no-shows. Internal: spreadsheets, radio chaos, and
    manual maps create stress and overtime. Philosophical: guest safety and
    experience shouldn’t depend on guesswork.

    We understand peak-day pressure. Built with marina operators and
    optimization engineers, our AI respects real constraints—depth, power,
    reserved docks, approach limits, groups, and security zones.
  plan: >-
    1) Import vessels, constraints, and marina layout. 2) Generate an optimal,
    conflict-free slip plan with live what-if and overrides. 3) Publish
    assignments to staff and skippers; adjust in real time.

    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot for your next event.
    Transitional: Download the Event Docking Checklist.
  success: >-
    Full docks with zero conflicts, faster turnarounds, safer tie-ups, calmer
    staff, happy skippers, clear audit trails, and higher event revenue.
  failure: >-
    Last-minute reshuffles, unsafe placements, angry VHF traffic, staff burnout,
    empty slips, and lost sponsor or transient revenue.
