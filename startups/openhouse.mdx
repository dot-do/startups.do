storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Real estate offices and brokerages that want every open house to reliably
    produce qualified leads, faster follow-up, and happier sellers—without
    adding work for agents.
  problem: >-
    Paper sign-ins and manual follow-up lose hot prospects; managers lack
    visibility; sellers want proof of effort. It shouldn’t be this hard to
    capture, qualify, and convert open-house traffic.
  guide: >-
    We understand open-house chaos and office-wide inconsistency. Built for
    brokerages, our AI-led workflow standardizes capture and follow-up,
    integrates with your CRM, and proves ROI to sellers.
  plan: >-
    1) Set up your office account and branded QR sign-in. 2) Agents run open
    houses—visitors scan and log in. 3) AI sends instant follow-up, scores
    leads, and produces seller feedback reports with a manager dashboard.
  callToAction: Start a 14-day pilot or book a 15-minute demo.
  success: >-
    Every open house captured, instant and consistent follow-up, prioritized
    leads for agents, transparent seller reports, stronger listings and
    recruiting, and a measurable pipeline lift at the office level.
  failure: >-
    Leads slip away, follow-up is slow or missed, sellers question your effort,
    marketing spend is wasted, and management stays in the dark about what’s
    working.
