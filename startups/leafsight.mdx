  problem:
    - >-
      Stockouts on high-velocity frontlist titles and top magazines cause 3–7%
      lost sales during peak windows (new releases, holidays, author tours)
    - >-
      Overstock on slow-moving backlist and niche magazines ties up 10–20%
      excess working capital and reduces GMROI
    - >-
      Manual buying based on intuition and generic POS reorder points struggles
      with long-tail SKUs, variable lead times, and street/on-sale dates
    - >-
      Returns in trade books average 20–30%; newsstand sell-through often
      25–40%, creating waste and labor cost
    - >-
      Fragmented supplier ecosystem (Ingram, PRH, Baker & Taylor, independent
      distros; TNG, Comag, Menzies, Frontline) increases complexity for POs,
      ASNs, returns, and compliance
    - >-
      Small and mid-sized retailers lack data science capability to leverage
      external signals (preorders, BookScan, social buzz, local events) for
      demand planning
  solution:
    - >-
      Demand forecasting engine combining POS, supplier lead times, preorders,
      BookScan/Nielsen, and local signals to predict title-level weekly demand
    - >-
      Dynamic safety stock and allocation optimized for shelf capacity,
      street/on-sale windows, and draw rules (magazines)
    - >-
      Auto-replenishment that generates EDI-compliant, supplier-ready POs with
      vendor pack/price validation and exception handling
    - >-
      Launch planner for frontlist and magazine issues to set initial
      allocations and adjust mid-cycle based on early reads
    - >-
      Returns optimization to identify non-productive stock and propose
      return/markdown actions that improve GMROI
    - >-
      Multi-location optimization to rebalance between stores/DCs and unify buys
      with vendor MOQs and freight breaks
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Category-tuned AI that predicts title-level demand and automatically creates
    supplier-ready POs, reducing stockouts 20–40% while cutting on-hand
    inventory 10–15% and returns 10–20%. Purpose-built for books/news: frontlist
    vs. backlist, street/on-sale dates, returns/consignment, and long-tail
    dynamics.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specialized models and data assets (ISBN/ISSN knowledge graph,
    BookScan integrations, on-sale/street-date handling) combined with certified
    EDI connections to major book and news distributors. Accumulating network
    effects from cross-retailer early-read signals enable superior new-title and
    issue forecasts that generic retail tools cannot match.
