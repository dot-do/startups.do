  title: Stockpile Volume and Inventory Reconciliation
  description: >-
    AI measures stockpile volumes from uploaded phone/drone imagery and
    reconciles against scale-house shipments/receipts.
  targetUsers:
    - Plant manager
    - Inventory controller
    - Finance
  triggers:
    - Month-end close
    - Post-blast inventory change
    - Audit prep
  inputs:
    - Phone/drone images or short videos of each pile with a known scale
    - Site map with pile IDs/material type
    - 'Optional: ground control points/RTK tags'
    - Scale-house tickets/ERP movements
  steps:
    - Provide quick capture guide; client records and uploads imagery
    - Run photogrammetry (SfM) to create orthomosaic/DSM/3D mesh
    - Compute pile extents and volumes vs last baseline
    - Reconcile volumes to tickets; flag variances and probable causes
    - 'Publish 3D viewer, report, and GL-ready adjustments'
  tools:
    - OpenDroneMap/OpenSfM/COLMAP
    - QGIS/GDAL/PDAL
    - Cloud storage (S3/Drive/SharePoint)
    - 'Optional: Pix4D/DroneDeploy ingestion'
  outputs:
    - Per-pile volumes by material
    - 3D map/orthomosaic
    - Variance report vs tickets
    - Shapefiles/COGs for GIS
  pricingModel:
    - Per-survey fee
    - or Site subscription (monthly) with included surveys
    - One-time setup for templates

  problem:
    - >-
      Inventory counts at quarries are infrequent and costly (outsourced
      drone/survey crews can cost $2,000–$8,000 per event), leading to quarterly
      or annual counts and month-to-month blind spots.
    - >-
      Measured vs. book inventory variances of 2–10% are common due to
      measurement error, moisture/density assumptions, wind loss, spillage, and
      mis-ticketed loads, resulting in write-offs and financial statement noise.
    - >-
      Manual measurement methods (walk-around GPS, tape, or loader-bucket
      heuristics) produce highly variable accuracy (±5–15%), creating disputes
      between operations and finance.
    - >-
      Scale-house systems capture shipments/receipts but are rarely reconciled
      to actual pile changes, so theft, misloads, and accounting errors go
      undetected for months.
    - >-
      Safety exposure: climbing piles and operating near stockpiles increases
      risk; site managers want fewer people on foot in active yards (MSHA
      recordables risk).
    - >-
      Operational latency: turning images into volumes takes hours to days with
      general photogrammetry tools; plant managers need same-day answers tied to
      specific materials and tickets.
    - >-
      Fragmented data: densities, moisture adjustments, and material IDs live in
      spreadsheets, leading to inconsistent assumptions and audit challenges.
    - >-
      Multi-site operators lack a standardized, auditable inventory workflow
      across locations, complicating consolidation and lender/insurer reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI photogrammetry from phone/drone images converts irregular piles into
      volumes with ±2–3% MAPE under typical quarry conditions.
    - >-
      Automated pile boundary detection and material identification, with
      configurable density and moisture libraries per material.
    - >-
      Reconciliation engine ingests shipments/receipts (CSV/API from
      scale-house) and compares expected pile deltas vs. measured change to
      surface discrepancies and anomalies.
    - >-
      Variance diagnostics attribute differences to moisture, density
      assumptions, unrecorded movements, and suspected mis-ticketing; alerting
      thresholds configurable by site/material.
    - >-
      Audit-ready reports: time-stamped 3D models, images, change maps, and
      ticket-matched variance tables for monthly close and external auditors.
    - >-
      Offline-capable mobile capture with safe standoff distances and automated
      flight/capture guidance; syncs when connectivity returns.
    - >-
      Multi-site dashboard for regional operators with user roles, approval
      workflows, and SLA-backed processing times (<2 hours typical).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Quantified stockpile volumes from ordinary phone or drone imagery,
    reconciled automatically against scale-house ticket data—delivering
    auditable, same-day inventory you can close the books on.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Purpose-built reconciliation between measured pile change and ticketed
    movements, trained on heterogeneous 212319 materials and real-world

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quarry and aggregate operations and finance leaders (NAICS 212319) who need
    accurate, auditable stockpile inventory without stopping production.
  problem: >-
    Manual surveys and infrequent flyovers create inventory drift and
    write-downs. Reconciling piles to scale-house shipments is slow,
    error-prone, and risky. You shouldn’t have to guess what’s on the ground.
  guide: >-
    We understand month-end pressure and MSHA safety realities. Our
    aggregates-focused AI turns phone or drone photos into accurate 3D volumes
    and reconciles them with your scale-house data for an audit-ready close.
  plan: >-
    Step 1: Capture each pile with a quick phone or drone walk-around. Step 2:
    Upload imagery and connect your scale-house exports or API. Step 3: Get
    reconciled volumes, variances, and reports you can sign off and share.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot: upload your first pile and connect your scale-house
    today.
  success: >-
    Close on time, see variances by pile and product, cut write-offs, reduce
    yard climbs, keep production moving, and hand auditors clear, defensible
    reports.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing at inventory, lose margin to shrink and rehandles, risk safety
    incidents on piles, and erode trust with finance, customers, and auditors.
