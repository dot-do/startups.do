  problem:
    - >-
      Creative briefs and brand guidelines are inconsistent and time-consuming
      to translate into actionable shot plans (often 2–6 hours per project).
    - >-
      Manual shot lists in Google Docs/Sheets miss critical details (lens
      choice, lighting ratios, props, timing), leading to on-set improvisation
      and reshoots.
    - >-
      Brand consistency suffers when multiple shooters or crews interpret the
      same guidelines differently.
    - >-
      Estimating time/cost and scheduling is error-prone, causing overages,
      overtime, and missed deliverables.
    - >-
      Version control and approvals across clients, producers, and shooters are
      fragmented (email chains, PDFs), slowing pre-production by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Freelancers and small studios lack producer resources to turn briefs into
      production-ready documents.
    - >-
      E-commerce and catalog teams need high-volume, repeatable shot systems
      across SKUs, but current tools aren’t built for stills-focused commercial
      workflows.
    - >-
      Existing tools (film-focused shot listers, generic project management)
      don’t connect creative intent to camera/lens/lighting specifics.
  solution:
    - >-
      Brief intake: Upload PDFs, brand guidelines, mood boards, or paste a
      client brief/URL. AI parses objectives, target audience, channels,
      deliverables, formats, constraints.
    - >-
      Brand style parsing: Extracts typography, color palette, visual
      do’s/don’ts, framing conventions; auto-checks proposed shots for
      compliance.
    - >-
      Shot plan generation: Creates a structured shot list with compositions,
      focal lengths, apertures, angles, lighting setup notes (key/fill/rim,
      modifiers, ratios), background, props, and alt shots.
    - >-
      Timing and schedule: Estimates setup and per-shot timing, builds a day
      plan (Gantt-style), flags overtime risk and setup conflicts.
    - >-
      Gear-aware suggestions: Recommends lenses, lights, modifiers based on
      user’s kit inventory or rental availability; offers substitutes if
      unavailable.
    - >-
      Prop and asset checklist: Auto-builds props/wardrobe/backdrop list with
      quantities, links to purchase/rent, and responsibilities.
    - >-
      Budget/time estimator: Converts schedule into time/cost ranges; highlights
      risk items (e.g., reflective products, liquids) that affect timing.
    - >-
      Collaboration & approvals: Comment threads, versioning, client review
      links, change tracking, e-sign approvals; audit trail.
    - >-
      Exports & integrations: PDF/CSV shot lists, call sheets; push tasks to
      Asana/Monday; sync to Google Drive/Dropbox; Capture One/Lightroom
      companion notes.
    - >-
      Visual references: Pulls brand-approved references or generates reference
      frames/mood boards to align composition and lighting intention.
    - >-
      Repeatability: Save “Shot Systems” templates for recurring SKUs (angles,
      crop, lighting map) with automated variations (colorways, sizes).
    - >-
      Analytics: Tracks actuals vs plan to improve future estimates; surfaces
      bottlenecks and on-set overruns.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From brief to production-ready shot plan in minutes. ShotCraft AI converts
    client briefs and brand guidelines into detailed shot lists with
    compositions, lenses, lighting notes, props, and timing—reducing
    pre-production time by 60–80%, improving brand consistency, and cutting
    reshoots by 20–40%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A verticalized, brand-aware AI trained on proprietary commercial photography
    shot plans and time/cost actuals, integrated directly into photographers’
    and studios’ daily tools (Capture One/Lightroom/Asana). Network effects from
    a curated template marketplace and brand-specific style packs make outputs
    measurably more accurate and consistent than generic AI or spreadsheets.
