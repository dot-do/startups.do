  problem:
    - >-
      High and variable startup scrap during job changeovers (commonly 200–1,000
      kg per changeover for film/lamination) due to trial-and-error setpoints
      for temps, die bolts, nip, line speed, tension, corona, and chill rolls.
    - >-
      Long time-to-spec (often 30–90 minutes) reduces available capacity and
      increases energy/adhesive consumption.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge concentrated in a few experts; operator turnover and
      shift-to-shift variability cause inconsistent results.
    - >-
      Recipe/run books are static and don’t account for resin lot variation,
      ambient conditions, adhesive age, or machine drift.
    - >-
      Existing APC/MPC systems optimize steady-state but do not recommend
      initial/transition setpoints tailored to job history and materials.
    - >-
      Limited closed-loop traceability and auditability of changes; difficult to
      meet brand-owner quality and compliance requirements.
    - >-
      Complex multilayer and lamination stacks increase risk of delamination,
      curl, COF variance, and gauge bands without data-driven starting
      conditions.
  solution:
    - >-
      Line- and job-aware initial setpoint recommender for temps, die bolts
      profile, nip pressure, line speed, tensions by zone, corona watt density,
      and chill roll temps.
    - >-
      Adaptive online adjustment suggestions within guardrails based on live
      feedback (gauge, web temperatures, coat weight, COF proxies, tension
      loads, film width, defect counts).
    - >-
      Job similarity search to retrieve best historical runs by material family,
      layer stack, target thickness/coat weight, order specs, resin/adhesive
      lots, and ambient conditions.
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML blending first-principles (heat transfer, rheology,
      winding, nip mechanics) with historical data for robust cold-start
      behavior.
    - >-
      Operator-in-the-loop HMI with confidence scores, expected outcomes (e.g.,
      predicted scrap/time), and one-click apply with MOC/audit trail.
    - >-
      Recipe governance: automatic versioning, change approvals, and rollbacks;
      ISA-95/ISA-88 alignment.

      Rockwell/Siemens PLCs, SCADA/MES connectors (e.g., Ignition, FactoryTalk,
      AVEVA).
    - >-
      Edge compute for real-time inference; cloud for model training, fleet
      learning, benchmarking, and secure data sharing across plants.

  character: >-
    Plant managers, process engineers, and line leads at plastics packaging film
    & sheet manufacturers (NAICS 326112) who need every
    extrusion/coating/lamination run to hit spec fast with minimal scrap.
  problem: >-
    - External: Too many variables (barrel/die temps, die bolts, nip load, line
    speed, web tension, corona power, chill roll temps) and job-to-job
    variability force trial-and-error and waste.

    - Internal: Pressure to meet schedule and quality with fewer veteran
    operators and rising resin costs.

    - Philosophical: Past data should make the next run right the first time—no
    one should burn resin to find setpoints.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pain of dial-ins that bleed minutes and pellets. Our AI is
    trained on your run history, resin data, specs, and asset limits—validated
    with process SMEs—to recommend safe, explainable setpoints and adjustments.
    Secure, traceable, and designed for operator trust.
  plan: >-
    - Process: (1) Connect job specs, run history, and asset limits. (2)
    Calibrate models per line/die/structure. (3) For each job, receive
    recommended initial setpoints (temps, die bolts, nip, speed, tension,
    corona, chill rolls) with guardrails and rationale. (4) Apply, log results,
    and get live adjustment guidance that learns over time.

    - Agreement: Human-in-the-loop; hard limits enforced; your data stays yours;
    change history is auditable.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Start a 4-week pilot on one line.

    - Transitional: Book a 30-minute demo; download the ROI calculator and a
    case study.
  success: |-
    - On-spec faster (fewer pulls to target)
    - Lower startup and changeover scrap
    - Higher OEE and more stable runs
    - Faster operator onboarding and knowledge capture
    - Fewer customer complaints and rework
    - Better schedule adherence and margin protection
  failure: |-
    - Continued trial-and-error, high scrap, and overtime
    - Missed ship dates and customer claims
    - Vulnerability when key experts are unavailable
    - Eroding margins from resin, energy, and downtime
