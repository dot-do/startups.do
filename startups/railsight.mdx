leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High alert volume and noise: Class I/II railroads receive tens of
      thousands of HBD/WILD/Acoustic alerts annually with 30–60%
      noise/duplicates, driving unnecessary set-outs, crew delays, and yard
      congestion.
    - >-
      Fragmented data prevents fast action: AEI reads, detector events, train
      consists, dispatch data, and maintenance history live in separate systems;
      mechanical desks spend 5–15 minutes per alert stitching context, delaying
      stop/continue decisions.
    - >-
      Inconsistent triage and missed trends: Threshold-only rules miss context
      (ambient temp, speed, prior readings) leading to both false negatives
      (missed hot bearings) and false positives (unnecessary set-outs).
    - >-
      Limited auditability and compliance: Manual notes and screenshots
      complicate post-incident investigations, AAR claims, and FRA audits; no
      standardized evidence trail or KPIs.
    - >-
      Work order friction: Drafting set-out/work orders and routing to the
      correct shop or contractor adds 10–30 minutes per incident and is
      error-prone.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time correlation engine that stitches HBD/WILD/Acoustic alerts with
      AEI tag reads, train consist/speed, prior detector history, environment
      (ambient temp/wind), grade/curvature, and maintenance records.
    - >-
      Risk scoring and recommended actions: stop now, set-out at next
      siding/yard, slow/monitor to next detector, or continue—each with
      confidence and rationale.
    - >-
      Automated drafting of set-out/work orders with AAR codes, part likelihood
      (e.g., bearing vs. wheel), nearest capable repair location, and estimated
      time/cost impact.
    - >-
      Noise suppression and de-duplication across detectors on the same
      line-of-road to minimize repeat calls on the same asset.
    - >-
      Ops workflow: one-click notification to dispatcher/mechanical,
      mobile-friendly view for crews, and escalation if unacknowledged within
      SLA.
    - >-
      Full audit trail and analytics: per-alert evidence pack, decisions,
      outcomes, and KPIs for FRA/AAR reporting and continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn noisy wayside alerts into prioritized, explainable actions in under 60
    seconds by fusing detector events with AEI/train/maintenance data—reducing
    unnecessary set-outs by 25–45%, cutting response time by 50–70%, and
    creating auditable, auto-drafted work orders that keep trains moving and
    assets safe.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-railroad, multi-sensor labeled dataset and correlation engine
    centered on AEI identity gives superior context and trend modeling;
    pre-built connectors to major EAM/TMS systems enable true closed-loop
    automation; explainable, policy-driven recommendations satisfy
    safety/compliance teams, reducing approval friction versus OEM-specific,
    black-box analytics.

  character: >-
    Rail operations and mechanical teams (dispatch/NOC, mechanical desk,
    trainmasters, car owners) who must act on HBD/WILD/acoustic alerts in real
    time without disrupting trains.
  problem: >-
    - External: High volumes of uncorrelated HBD/WILD/acoustic alerts; limited
    context from AEI/consist; manual triage is slow and inconsistent.

    - Internal: Alarm fatigue and uncertainty about severity, location, and next
    best action.

    - Philosophical: Safety‑critical defects shouldn’t be buried in noise or
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand late‑night alarms, set‑out decisions under pressure, and
    regulatory scrutiny. Our rail ops + ML team integrates detector, AEI, and
    train data to rank severity, pinpoint car/wheel, and recommend
    actions—validated in pilots to reduce noise and speed decisions.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Ingest wayside alerts, AEI reads, train consist/speed/location
    via secure APIs.

    - Configure: Calibrate rules and ML thresholds to your territory, detectors,
    and SOPs.

    - Prove: Run a 60–90 day pilot on selected lanes; compare outcomes and tune.

    - Deploy: Go live with 24/7 dashboard, alerts, and auto-drafted set-out/work
    orders to TMS/EAM/CMMS.

    - Support: SLA-backed monitoring, weekly reviews, continuous model updates.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute demo and pick a pilot territory. Transitional:
    Request a sample triage report and ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    - Faster, clearer decisions with prioritized alerts and precise car/wheel
    identification.

    - Fewer unnecessary set‑outs and service disruptions; better network
    velocity and OTIF.

    - Improved safety and compliance; documented actions and audit trail.

    - Shorter shop cycle times via pre-filled, accurate work orders.

    - Higher crew confidence and reduced alarm fatigue.
  failure: >-
    - Continued alarm overload and manual second‑guessing.

    - Missed critical defects or late interventions leading to incidents and
    delays.

    - More unnecessary set‑outs, network slowdowns, and regulatory exposure.

  problem:
    - Detector alarms flood the desk; true defects are buried in noise.
    - Manual AEI cross-referencing slows response and creates errors.
    - Missed set-out windows cause road failures and delay minutes.
    - Triage varies by shift; policies aren’t consistently applied.
    - Handoffs to mechanical crews are fragmented; no clean audit trail.
    - 'Decisions lack context (train makeup, location, direction, yard capacity).'
    - 'Outcomes aren’t captured, so false positives persist.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse detector alerts with AEI reads, consist, speed, tonnage, and
      territory data.
    - Score risk and urgency to surface the top actions in real time.
    - Recommend optimal set-out locations and timing to minimize network impact.
    - Auto-generate work orders and set-out instructions for fast approval.
    - Route to the right desk/crew and track disposition end-to-end.
    - Continuously learn from outcomes to cut false positives and improve rules.
  features:
    - >-
      Detector-agnostic ingestion (HBD, WILD, acoustic, dragging equipment,
      truck hunting).
    - Live AEI correlation with car/locomotive history and prior defects.
    - 'Consist-aware logic (position-in-train, length, tonnage per axle).'
    - >-
      Geo-aware triage using subdivision, milepost, siding capacity, and
      upcoming yards.
    - Configurable rule packs aligned to railroad policy and FRA thresholds.
    - ML defect probability with confidence scores and explainable rationale.
    - >-

    - TMS/dispatch integration; crew and yard notifications out-of-the-box.
    - 'Real-time alerts via web, mobile, email/SMS, and system webhooks.'
    - 'Role-based access, SSO, audit trail, retention, and governance.'
    - >-
      KPI dashboards: avoided defects, delay minutes saved, false alarm rate,
      MTTR.
    - APIs for OEMs and service partners; OEM-independent architecture.
    - >-
      Cloud or on-prem deployment with high availability and rail-grade
      security.
  steps:
    - 'Connect detector, AEI, and train lineup feeds.'
    - Normalize and correlate events to equipment IDs and train context.
    - Score risk and recommend actions with explainable AI.
    - Suggest best set-out location and timing based on network impact.
