leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned failures of pumps, compressors, and gearboxes in
      polymerization/finishing cause high-cost outages ($30k–$150k per hour lost
      contribution margin, depending on unit).
    - >-
      Polymer service is harsh: variable viscosity, fouling, solids, and
      batch/transient operation increase false alarms in generic PdM and mask
      early-stage faults (seal wear, cavitation, bearing spall, gearbox tooth
      damage).
    - >-
      Existing condition monitoring is fragmented (route-based vibration, OEM
      tools, historian trends) and not fused into actionable, prioritized work
      orders with RUL estimates.
    - >-
      Reliability teams are stretched; senior analysts are scarce. Plants
      struggle to maintain PdM program coverage across 200–600 rotating assets
      per site.
    - >-
      Safety and compliance risk: mechanical seal failures in monomers
      (butadiene, styrene, acrylonitrile) can trigger flaring, emissions, or PSM
      events.
    - >-
      ROI uncertainty: leadership hesitates without clear KPIs, baselines, and
      guaranteed payback from pilots.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest multi-signal data (vibration, process, electrical) from historian
      and online monitors; augment with Class I Div 2/Zone 2 wireless sensors
      where gaps exist.
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML models tailored for polymer service
      (cavitation/fouling-aware pump models, compressor surge/valve wear,
      gearbox load variability) with operating-mode segmentation for
      batch/transient cycles.
    - >-
      Asset health scoring and RUL predictions with confidence intervals;
      root-cause suggestions and recommended corrective actions tied to spare
      parts and job plans.
    - >-
      CMMS integration (SAP PM/Maximo) to auto-generate prioritized
      notifications/work orders with lead time aligned to RUL and maintenance
      windows.
    - >-
      Criticality mapping to focus on the top 20–40% high-impact assets; dynamic
      prioritization by production plan and safety criticality.
    - >-
      Operational workflow: 90-day proof-of-value on 20–40 assets → scale to
      150–250 assets/site in 12 months, including change management and skills
      transfer to in-house teams.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific predictive maintenance for polymerization and finishing
    units that reduces unplanned rotating-equipment downtime by 30–40%, detects
    faults 7–30 days earlier, and delivers calibrated Remaining Useful Life
    (RUL) with <20% mean absolute error—seamlessly integrated with plant
    historian and CMMS to trigger the right work at the right time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Validated polymer-service failure library and operating-mode-aware models
    that materially reduce false alarms in batch/transient conditions; deep
    integrations to historian/CMMS enabling automated, prioritized work orders;
    and early reference sites in synthetic rubber creating a data moat and
    domain credibility.

    Reliability and production leaders at synthetic rubber plants (NAICS 325212)
    responsible for compressors, pumps, and gearboxes in polymerization and
    finishing units.
  problem: >-
    Hidden degradation and surprise failures halt lines, create scrap, risk
    safety, and spike costs; without early anomaly detection and RUL,
    maintenance stays reactive and stressful.
  guide: >-
    We understand how a single compressor trip cascades through polymerization
    and finishing. Our AI PdM service combines process and vibration analytics
    to detect anomalies and predict RUL for rotating equipment in synthetic
    rubber operations.
  plan: >-
    Connect data sources (historians, CMMS, sensors); calibrate models with
    run-states and failure history; deliver prioritized alerts and RUL into your
    planning workflow. Prove value on a pilot asset train in weeks, then scale
    plant-wide.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30-minute demo and select a pilot asset, or request the readiness
    checklist.
  success: >-
    Fewer unplanned outages, optimized maintenance windows, extended asset life,
    stable throughput and quality, lower OPEX, and audit-ready risk reduction.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting: emergency shutdowns, missed shipments, costly
    overhauls, safety or environmental incidents, and strained maintenance
    bandwidth.

  problem:
    - Unplanned trips stall polymerization trains and cause off-spec batches.
    - Time-based overhauls waste budget and miss hidden failures.
    - >-
      Early signs of cavitation, seal wear, and gearbox fatigue get lost in
      historian noise.

    - Reactive spares and crew scheduling drive up downtime and cost.
    - Compliance and process safety demand traceable asset health evidence.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously monitor compressors, pumps, and gearboxes with multivariate
      models.
    - Detect anomalies early and prioritize by risk and production impact.
    - Forecast Remaining Useful Life with confidence bands for outage planning.
    - >-
      Explainable alerts pinpoint root drivers like suction instability or
      bearing wear.
    - Sync recommendations to SAP PM/Maximo to plan and verify work.
    - 'Deploy at the edge or cloud; secure, low-latency, and scalable.'
  features:

    - 'Dashboards for avoided downtime, MTBF, and energy per ton.'
    - Deploy fast and scale from pilot line to site-wide coverage.
  steps:
    - '1) Connect data: historian (PI/IP.21/PHD), DCS/PLC, vibration, and CMMS.'
    - '2) Baseline: 30–60 days of normal operation; set health thresholds.'
    - '3) Go live: anomaly alerts and RUL in app, email, or Teams/Slack.'
