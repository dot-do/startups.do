  problem:
    - >-
      Wineries spend 8–20 hours per release producing assets across product
      pages, emails, ads, social, tech sheets, and PR; small teams can’t keep up
      across multiple labels and vintages.
    - >-
      Maintaining brand voice consistency across channels is hard, especially
      with seasonal staff and agencies; off-brand copy erodes trust with club
      members and trade.
    - >-
      Content is often late relative to allocation windows; slow launch cycles
      reduce sell-through velocity and leave inventory on hand.
    - >-
      Compliance and accuracy issues (TTB label info, alcohol %, appellation,
      allergens) create risk and rework.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated tools forces manual copy-paste between
      Commerce7/WineDirect/Shopify, Klaviyo/Mailchimp, Meta/Google; tagging and
      UTM tracking are inconsistent.
    - >-
      Most wineries lack reliable performance data to improve future releases;
      few run structured A/B tests on messaging or creative.
  solution:
    - >-
      Brand voice builder imports site copy, past emails, and label stories to
      learn tone, lexicon, and style guards.
    - >-
      Release intake collects label data, vineyard notes, vintage conditions,
      TTB COLA data, price, allocation, and inventory to drive messaging and
      urgency.
    - >-
      One-click kit generation outputs: product page copy modules, SEO metadata,
      image alt text, 3–5 email drips, 10–20 ad variants, social captions,
      PR/press release, and a 1-page trade tech sheet.
    - >-
      Compliance and accuracy assistant flags deviations on ABV, appellation,
      allergens, bottle size; maps mandatory statements and suggests
      corrections.
    - >-
      Integrations publish directly to Commerce7/WineDirect/Shopify,
      Klaviyo/Mailchimp, Meta/Google Ads; auto-apply UTMs and GA4 events.
    - >-
      Optimization loop recommends A/B tests, subject lines, and ad variants;
      reports on conversion and sell-through; learns from winners to refine
      future kits.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop edit option adds a certified wine copy editor review
      within 24 hours for high-stakes releases.
    - >-
      Image enhancer creates on-brand hero crops and background variants;
      optional Canva template export.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
