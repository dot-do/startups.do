leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Excess unplanned downtime (8–18% of scheduled time) on EPS/XPS lines due
      to recurring but poorly diagnosed faults (steam pressure dips, vacuum
      leaks, bead moisture variance, valve sticking, extruder surging).
    - >-
      High alarm noise (200–1,500 alarms/day/line) with little causal context;
      operators triage chronologically rather than causally, inflating
      mean-time-to-diagnose (MTTD) to 25–45 minutes.
    - >-
      Tribal knowledge loss from turnover and aging workforce; maintenance notes
      are unstructured and not searchable, causing repeated trial-and-error on
      the same faults.
    - >-
      Root causes span utilities and process islands (pre-expander, aging silos,
      molding/extrusion, cutting, packaging); siloed data prevents end-to-end
      reasoning.
    - >-
      OEM manuals and fault codes are generic; existing SCADA alarm views lack
      next-best diagnostic steps tied to local equipment and recipes.
    - >-
      OEE and scrap targets are missed because upstream issues (e.g., bead
      density drift, wet bead) aren’t detected until downstream alarms fire; no
      early-warning diagnostics.
    - >-
      Current improvement programs require engineers to manually mine logs with
      spreadsheets or ad-hoc SQL; slow and not repeatable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge agent ingests PLC/SCADA alarm and event streams (OPC UA/DA,
      Ethernet/IP, Modbus/TCP), historian tags (pressure, temperature, vacuum,
      density), and maintenance notes from CMMS.
    - >-
      Sequence-mining and causal-graph models learn typical fault progressions
      (e.g., steam pressure dip → mold temp low → incomplete fusion) to rank
      likely root causes with confidence scores.
    - >-
      LLM-based note miner structures unstructured maintenance logs into
      standardized failure modes, parts replaced, and effective fixes;
      continuously updates the knowledge base.
    - >-
      Next-best diagnostic engine proposes 3–5 guided checks (e.g., verify steam
      trap downstream of mold 3; run vacuum leak test; inspect condensate
      return) with expected outcomes and time-to-complete.
    - >-
      Operator co-pilot UI embeds in HMI/SCADA browser or runs on tablets;
      one-click work-order creation with pre-filled fault codes and parts into
      CMMS (Fiix, UpKeep, Maximo).
    - >-
      Alarm rationalization companion groups chattering/nuisance alarms,
      recommends suppression/latching/timing per ISA 18.2, and simulates impact
      before changes.
    - >-
      On-edge privacy: models run locally; optional anonymized telemetry to
      cloud for fleet learning; strict read-only access to controls layer; no
      PLC writes.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut unplanned downtime on polystyrene foam lines by 15–30% within 90 days by
    turning raw PLC alarms, SCADA events, and maintenance notes into ranked
    root-cause hypotheses and next-best diagnostics—deployed at the edge,
    read-only, and tailored to EPS/XPS processes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific EPS/XPS failure-mode library and causal graphs trained on
    multi-plant event sequences, combined with OEM/SI partnerships to embed at
    source; on-edge, read-only inference with traceable evidence chains drives
    operator trust and rapid adoption—a dataset and workflow moat difficult for
    generic APM tools to replicate.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and maintenance leaders at EPS and XPS foam plants who need to
    maximize uptime, quality, and throughput.
  problem: >-
    Unplanned stops are hard to diagnose—alarm floods bury the first fault,
    event sequences are opaque, and tribal knowledge is scattered. The result is
    long MTTR, scrap, and missed orders.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam production and controls. Our AI mines PLC alarms and
    events plus maintenance notes to infer likely root causes such as steam
    supply, vacuum integrity, mold temperature, and hot-wire issues, then
    recommends next-best diagnostics.
  plan: >-
    Connect historian or SCADA and CMMS data. The agent learns failure patterns
    from your lines. Operators receive ranked root-cause hypotheses and guided
    checks inside existing workflows.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot on one line. Connect logs, get explanations in days,
    and track MTTR and downtime improvements.
  success: >-
    Rapid recoveries, fewer unplanned stops, lower scrap, captured know-how,
    higher OEE, safer shifts, and predictable on-time production.
  failure: >-
    Without it, teams keep chasing noisy alarms, lose hours to guesswork, burn
    out, miss orders, and watch maintenance and energy costs climb.

  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent stops across pre-expansion, molding, and cutting with unclear
      origin
    - Alarm storms mask the first fault; teams chase symptoms instead of causes
    - Maintenance notes are unstructured and never loop back to operators
