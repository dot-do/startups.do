leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual appointment scheduling and tendering consume 8–15 minutes per
      shipment across emails and portals, creating bottlenecks and high labor
      cost per load.
    - >-
      Missed or late appointments cause chargebacks, redeliveries, and
      detention; typical avoidable accessorials range $8–$22 per LTL shipment
      when appointments slip.
    - >-
      Carrier tender acceptance can take hours; low first-pass acceptance leads
      to cascading delays and poor OTIF (On-Time In-Full) performance.
    - >-
      Operations teams juggle 10–30 portals (Opendock, C3, retailer portals)
      plus email threads; context switching increases errors and response
      latency.
    - >-
      After-hours/weekend gaps stall dock scheduling and tender coverage,
      elongating cycle time and increasing dwell.
    - >-
      Limited TMS/EDI coverage for real-world exceptions (e.g., “reschedule
      requested,” “dock closed,” “PRO mismatch”) leads to manual work-arounds
      and poor auditability.
    - >-
      Inconsistent data (appointment IDs, PRO/BOL/PO) across systems undermines
      visibility and KPI measurement, complicating root-cause analysis.
    - >-
      Scaling seasonal surges requires temp staffing or BPO handoffs with long
      ramp time and knowledge loss.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified AI agent reads and writes across email inboxes, appointment
      portals, and TMS/EDI to propose, book, and confirm time slots;
      automatically updates systems of record.
    - >-
      Tender orchestration uses rules and machine learning to sequence carriers
      by cost/service/transit and push tenders via API/EDI/email; escalates on
      timeouts and declines.
    - >-
      Exception handling playbooks (dock closed, reschedule, accessorial
      required) resolve via portal steps or targeted emails; unresolved items
      route to human ops with full context.
    - >-
      Calendar sync with consignee/warehouse systems; holds slots, rebooks
      conflicts, and maintains confirmation IDs/notes for audits.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop console to supervise, override, and continuously train
      models; SOC 2 controls and immutable activity logs.
    - >-
      Integrations: leading TMS (MercuryGate, Blue Yonder, OTM, Manhattan,
      Turvo), EDI 204/990/214/210 via VANs/APIs, appointment platforms
      (Opendock, C3), visibility networks (FourKites, project44).
    - >-
      Operational coverage 24/7 with optional managed service for
      nights/weekends and surge events.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    An AI operations agent that autonomously books, rebooks, and confirms LTL
    dock appointments and orchestrates tenders across email, portals, EDI, and
    TMS—with human-in-the-loop safety, full audit trails, and measurable OTIF
    and cost improvements.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing corpus of lane- and consignee-specific appointment/tender outcomes
    and portal interaction patterns, encoded into reusable adapters and
    playbooks, yields superior automation rates and speed. Combined with SOC
    2–backed auditability and 24/7 managed exceptions, we deliver reliability
    competitors with generic RPA, single-portal solutions, or manual BPO cannot
    match.
