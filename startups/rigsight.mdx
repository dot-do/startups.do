  problem:
    - >-
      Calibration and verification runs often contain subtle anomalies
      (temperature/pressure spikes, entrained air, unstable flow regime) that
      operators miss, causing erroneous meter factors and costly rework.
    - >-
      Meter factor drift across rigs, fluids, and operators is detected late
      (after customer complaints or warranty returns), leading to scrap,
      recalls, or returns.
    - >-
      Lack of standardized, cross-rig analytics prevents early detection of
      drift or bias introduced by rig hardware changes, maintenance, or software
      updates.
    - >-
      Manual spreadsheet SPC and ad hoc scripts are slow, inconsistent, and do
      not scale; evidence packs for ISO/IEC 17025 audits are labor-intensive to
      compile.
    - >-
      Existing SCADA/LIMS/DAQ tools capture data but provide limited
      domain-specific QA analytics (e.g., proving run gate checks per API/AGA,
      change-point drift detection, operator influence analysis).
    - >-
      Test stand downtime from chasing false anomalies and unstable runs
      increases cost/test and misses shipment dates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest calibration/verification run data from test stands (OPC UA, MQTT
      Sparkplug, Modbus/TCP, CSV, SQL) and automatically segment runs by rig,
      product, fluid, operator, and conditions.
    - >-
      Physics- and standard-aware QA checks: proving run gate checks, stability
      windows, Reynolds/viscosity sanity checks, temperature/pressure
      compensation validation, leak/air entrainment heuristics.
    - >-
      Drift and anomaly detection: change-point detection on meter factor and
      key tags; cross-rig bias detection; operator influence analysis; factor
      stability index per meter model/size/fluid.
    - >-
      SPC at scale: automated X̄-R, EWMA, CUSUM charts per rig/operator/product;
      automated alerts with prioritized root-cause hypotheses based on tag
      correlations and maintenance history.
    - >-
      Compliance and traceability: auto-generate ISO/IEC 17025-friendly evidence
      packs with data lineage, audit trail, and acceptance criteria mapping to
      API/AGA/OIML procedures.
    - >-
      Dashboards and APIs: live rig heatmaps, factor stability scores,
      out-of-tolerance run queue, and REST/SQL export to MES/QMS/LIMS; optional
      on-prem edge gateway for low-latency scoring.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement: operator coaching insights, run recipe
      recommendations, and what-changed analysis after maintenance/software
      updates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect drift and unstable meter factors early, across rigs and operators,
    with physics-informed AI that turns raw calibration runs into actionable QA
    decisions and audit-ready evidence—cutting rework, escapes, and downtime.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, cross-rig labeled dataset and physics-informed detection models
    tailored to meter proving and calibration workflows, plus a connector
    library that reduces time-to-value from months to days and produces
    audit-ready evidence packs aligned to industry standards.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Calibration, quality, and metrology leaders at totalizing fluid meter and
    counting device manufacturers (NAICS 334514) who must trust every test-stand
    run to release product on time.
  problem: >-
    External: Meter-factor drift, rig/operator variability, noisy/unstable runs,
    and false pass/fail create rework, delays, warranty risk, and audit
    exposure.

    Internal: Teams are stuck in spreadsheets and manual plots, never fully
    confident they caught drift early.

    Philosophical: Test data should be as precise and trustworthy as the meters
    you ship.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to ship accurate meters fast. Our metrology + ML
    team has analyzed millions of calibration/verification runs. Methods align
    with ISO/IEC 17025 practices and API MPMS principles, delivering explainable
    flags that operators and auditors trust.
  plan: >-
    - Connect your rigs: CSV/API ingest for historical and live runs (flow
    labs/test stands).

    - Baseline and monitor: Per model/rig/operator drift and anomaly detection
    with explainable metrics and thresholds.

    - Resolve and improve: Review flags in a dashboard, auto-generate CAPA-ready
    reports, coach operators, and stabilize meter factors.

    Assurances: Secure, read-only connectors; on-prem or private cloud; you own
    your data.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a demo and start a 30-day pilot on your historical runs.

    Transitional: Download a sample anomaly report and ROI estimate; get the
    Flow Lab QA checklist.
  success: >-
    You release meters faster with stable factors, catch issues before shipment,
    reduce rework and line stops, pass audits with confidence, cut warranty
    costs, and run a predictable, high-throughput flow lab.
  failure: >-
    Without this, drift hides in plain sight, bad meters ship, audits escalate,
    scrap and rework rise, schedules slip, and customer trust erodes.
