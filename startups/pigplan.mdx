  problem:
    - >-
      Integrity planning is fragmented across spreadsheets, GIS, and vendor
      PDFs; cycle time from ILI receipt to approved pig plan/dig list can exceed
      8–12 weeks.
    - >-
      Operators face budget, crew, and outage constraints yet must meet PHMSA
      Part 195/API 1160 risk targets; current prioritization is qualitative and
      not easily auditable.
    - >-
      Dig hit rate (percentage of excavations requiring repair) often sits at
      40–60%, driving unnecessary digs and spend.
    - >-
      Reinspection intervals and pig sequences are typically calendar-based
      rather than risk-based, causing under/over-inspection of segments.
    - >-
      Uncertainty in ILI tool sizing/performance (POD/tolerance) is not
      consistently propagated into risk and dig decisions.
    - >-
      Scenario analysis (what if budget ±20%, tool/spec changes, new HCA
      designation) is slow; decisions are hard to defend in audits.
    - >-
      Crew and permit windows (land access, environmental windows, hydrotest
      conflicts) are not optimized, causing rework and delays.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated ingestion/normalization of ILI data (MFL/UT/geometry) and prior
      run match-up to compute corrosion growth by feature/cluster with
      uncertainty.
    - >-
      Risk engine calculating PoF (time-dependent corrosion + uncertainty) × CoF
      (HCA/proximity/outflow/environmental sensitivity/product) aligned with API
      1160/PHMSA expectations.
    - >-
      Optimization module that selects dig candidates and sequences pig runs
      under constraints (budget, crew capacity, outage windows, permits) to meet
      defined risk targets (e.g., line/segment risk ≤ threshold) at least cost.
    - >-
      Scenario planning: compare plans by budget levels, inspection intervals,
      tool types, and consequence assumptions; produce side-by-side KPI deltas.
    - >-
      Audit trail with versioned models, inputs, and decisions, generating
      PHMSA-ready documentation and change logs.
    - >-
      APIs and connectors to GIS (Esri), PIMS (PODS), work management
      (Maximo/SAP), and common ILI vendor formats.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review workflow for engineering overrides, rationale
      capture, and final approval routing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A defensible, audit-ready AI that optimizes pig run schedules and excavation
    picks to meet IMP risk targets at minimum cost—cut planning cycle time by
    50%, increase dig hit rate to 70–85%, and reduce total integrity program
    cost by 10–20% while maintaining or lowering system risk.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from cross-operator, de-identified dig outcomes to
    calibrate corrosion growth and ILI uncertainty priors—improving hit rate and
    risk accuracy over time—combined with a defendable, audit-traceable
    optimizer purpose-built for PHMSA/API-aligned IMP targets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Pipeline integrity managers at liquids operators who must decide which lines
    to pig and which anomalies to dig—on time and within budget—to meet IMP risk
    targets and regulatory commitments.
  problem: >-
    Too many ILI features, uncertain corrosion growth, scattered data, and fixed
    budgets make pig and dig planning guesswork—risk targets are missed, costs
    spike, and compliance exposure grows.
  guide: >-
    Pigging Plan & Integrity Dig Prioritizer is built by pipeline integrity and
    data-science experts. It provides transparent, PHMSA-ready rationale for
    every priority, validated against real ILI, repair, and hydrotest histories.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and targets: ingest ILI, pipe tally, GIS/HCAs, CP, repairs;
    set IMP risk thresholds and repair rules. 2) Prioritize: AI ranks pig runs
    and dig candidates using corrosion growth, ILI features, and consequence;
    test budget/crew constraints and what-ifs. 3) Execute and learn: publish
    schedules, track risk KPIs, and auto-update after new ILIs and digs.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Schedule a demo or start a 60-day pilot on a selected system.
    Secondary: Request a no-cost risk snapshot and sample prioritization report.
  success: >-
    Hit IMP risk targets with fewer digs and optimized pig schedules; lower
    probability and consequence of failure; cut planning time; stay audit-ready;
    reduce leaks and unplanned outages while freeing budget for high-impact
    repairs.
  failure: >-
    Continue firefighting with missed threats, unnecessary digs, blown budgets,
    audit findings, unplanned shutdowns, and increased safety/environmental
    risk.

    subtitle: >-

  problem:
    - Backlogs of ILI findings and dig candidates overwhelm limited crews.
    - 'Manual spreadsheets create inconsistent, non-repeatable risk decisions.'
    - Pigging schedules aren’t aligned to corrosion growth or consequence.
    - Reactive digs raise OPEX and miss IMP risk targets.
    - Hard to prove why a run or dig was prioritized when auditors ask.
    - Budgets and outage windows change faster than plans can update.
  solution:
    - 'Generate a risk-aligned pigging and dig plan in minutes, not months.'
    - 'Rank by corrosion growth, ILI feature severity, and consequence (P×C).'
    - Optimize run timing and dig packages to meet IMP targets within budget.
    - 'Scenario test what-if budgets, windows, and targets instantly.'
    - Produce audit-ready rationale for every decision.
    - Reduce non-productive digs while lowering system risk.
