  problem:
    - >-
      Literature landscaping and evidence mapping takes 6–12 weeks using manual
      processes, delaying R&D, regulatory, and market access decisions.
    - >-
      Manual screening throughput averages 40–60 abstracts/hour/person and
      requires 2–5 FTE-weeks/project, costing $20k–$100k per review.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling (databases, reference managers, spreadsheets) leads to
      errors, poor reproducibility, and weak audit trails not aligned to
      PRISMA/AMSTAR/GRADE expectations.
    - >-
      Stakeholders struggle to see evidence gaps and coverage across modalities
      (clinical, preclinical, engineering, environmental, safety) in a single,
      navigable artifact.
    - >-
      Evidence maps become stale quickly; maintaining “living” reviews is
      operationally heavy and rarely budgeted.
    - >-
      Non-English and gray literature coverage is inconsistent, risking bias and
      regulatory pushback.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted pipeline: query formulation, multi-database retrieval,
      deduplication, relevance screening, PICO/PECO tagging, data extraction,
      and evidence matrix generation with human-in-the-loop QA.
    - >-
      Delivery of an interactive evidence map (web) plus exportable evidence
      matrix (CSV/Excel), PRISMA-style flow diagram, gap analysis heatmaps, and
      a methods/audit pack.
    - >-
      Rapid tier (72 hours, scoped to 1–2 questions), Standard tier (2 weeks,
      deeper extraction), and Living Monitoring tier (weekly/monthly updates).
    - >-
      Compliance-aligned outputs: PRISMA-style documentation, reproducibility
      logs, versioned queries, model settings, and decision audit trails.
    - >-
      Multilingual and gray literature coverage through curated connectors and
      client-provided subscriptions; configurable rules for inclusion/exclusion
      and risk-of-bias flags.
    - >-
      API and SSO-enabled workspace; secure deployment options (SaaS, VPC, or
      on-prem) with enterprise data governance.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, regulator-ready literature landscapes and evidence maps with
    transparent, auditable methods. From search to gap analysis in 72 hours,
    continuously updated, at 30–60% lower cost than manual reviews.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A compliance-grade audit trail with versioned queries and model settings,
    coupled with proprietary, cross-domain gold-standard datasets that
    consistently achieve high recall with controlled false negatives. Embedded
    human-in-the-loop workflows yield regulator-ready outputs and living updates
    that incumbents’ manual processes cannot match on speed or cost.

  character: >-
    Scientific and technical consultants who need a fast, defensible view of the
    literature to guide recommendations, proposals, and R&D decisions.
  problem: >-
    Manual reviews are slow and fragmented; deadlines loom while sources
    multiply, risking missed evidence and shaky recommendations when decisions
    should be grounded in complete, current science.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of client scrutiny and short timelines. Our team
    blends domain experts and information scientists with audited, transparent
    AI methods to deliver reproducible, citable outputs.
  plan: >-
    1) Define scope and quality bar. 2) Run AI-augmented search, screening, and
    extraction across major databases and grey literature. 3) Deliver an
    evidence matrix, gap map, and executive brief with exportable data and full
    citations.
  callToAction: >-
    Book a 20-minute scoping call or request a sample evidence map and methods
    sheet.
  success: >-
    In days, see the state of the science, surface gaps and opportunities,
    defend recommendations with clarity, accelerate proposals and R&D, and save
    weeks of analyst time.
  failure: >-
    Miss key studies, duplicate work, overinvest in dead-ends, deliver weak or
    delayed recommendations, and lose credibility and bids due to patchy
    evidence.
