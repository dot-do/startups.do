  problem:
    - >-
      Instructors spend 2–4 hours per week per student building and revising
      lesson plans and tracking ACS/PTS tasks in spreadsheets or paper, causing
      inconsistency and missed items.
    - >-
      Schools lack real-time visibility into ACS proficiency, stage-check
      readiness, and instructor variance; this leads to longer
      times-to-solo/certification and lower first-time checkride pass rates.
    - >-
      Students have poor line-of-sight to progress, expected costs, and
      readiness; uncertainty drives dropouts and schedule churn.
    - >-
      Part 141 recordkeeping and syllabus conformance are time-consuming; audits
      and stage checks require manual compilation and backfilling.
    - >-
      Performance data is fragmented across schedulers, logbooks, sims, and exam
      prep; insights are lost and cannot be fed back into training plans.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-generated individualized syllabi per student mapped to the current FAA
      ACS/PTS; automatically updates based on flights, sims, knowledge test
      results, and instructor evaluations.
    - >-
      Per-lesson brief/debrief packets: objectives, ACS tolerances, maneuver
      sequencing, risk controls (PAVE/IMSAFE), grading rubrics, and
      homework/remediation tasks.
    - >-
      Stage-check readiness index and gating: real-time gap analysis, required
      evidences, and exportable check packets for 141/University programs.
    - >-
      Instructor standardization: shared maneuver scripts, tolerances, callouts,
      and evaluation scales; variance analytics across instructors and fleets.
    - >-
      Data ingestion from scheduling, logbooks, sims, and EFBs; unified
      proficiency model predicting next-best lesson and likely weak areas.
    - >-
      Regulatory/records: Part 141-friendly records export, audit logs, and
      syllabus conformance reports; versioning tied to ACS/PTS revisions.
    - >-
      Student-facing progress tracker and cost/time forecast that updates with
      performance and weather/cancelations.
    - >-
      Offline/print-friendly reports for DPE prep; automatically compiled
      endorsements checklist and cross-country planning coverage.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Continuously personalized training plans mapped to FAA ACS/PTS that cut
    planning time, standardize training, and improve pass rates and
    time-to-solo—delivered through instructor-in-the-loop AI with school-grade
    compliance and integrations.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Instructor-validated ACS knowledge graph plus cross-platform performance
    data that learns maneuver difficulty by aircraft, airport, and
    environment—creating superior lesson sequencing and readiness predictions
    not easily replicated. Early integrations and insurer/association
    endorsements deepen switching costs and trust.
