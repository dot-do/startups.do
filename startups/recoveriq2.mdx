  problem:
    - >-
      Low precision in deciding which delinquent accounts to assign to
      repossession versus cure/extension causes wasted fees and lost recoveries.
    - >-
      Assignments are often sent to the wrong channel (e.g., non-LPR vs. LPR
      agent, skip trace vs. field visit) and at suboptimal times, lowering
      capture probability and increasing cycle time.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (servicing, repo platforms, LPR, valuation, contact
      history) prevents a consolidated ROI view to drive decisions.
    - >-
      Compliance risks (SCRA, bankruptcy, cease & desist) and poor audit trails
      increase wrongful repossession exposure and regulatory findings.
    - >-
      Forwarders and agencies lack standardized, comparable case quality scores
      to prioritize field work and allocate scarce agent capacity.
    - >-
      Lenders have limited real-time feedback loops from agent outcomes,
      impairing model improvement and process tuning.
  solution:
    - >-
      Portfolio triage score: per-account probability of recovery (with
      confidence interval) and expected net proceeds (vehicle value minus fees).
    - >-
      ROI optimizer: recommends act-now vs. wait, and the best assignment
      channel (LPR-enabled agent, traditional agent, skip trace, field visit,
      impound check, voluntary surrender outreach).
    - >-
      Timing recommender: suggests day/time windows and dwell-time thresholds to
      maximize capture probability and minimize storage/transport costs.
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: automated checks for SCRA, bankruptcy, cease &
      desist, consent flags, and state-specific rules; blocks or alters
      recommendations accordingly; full audit log.
    - >-
      Data enrichment: vehicle valuation (e.g., Black Book/Manheim MMR), LPR
      sighting density/recency, geospatial risk, historical
      contact/Promise-to-Pay propensity, insurance/impound signals where
      available.
    - >-
      Workflow integrations: APIs and connectors to RDN/iRepo/Clearplan and
      major servicing systems; push scores/recommendations into existing queues;
      agent mobile worklist export.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: captures agent outcome events (sighted, hooked,
      recovered, no-contact, wrongful repo) to retrain models; A/B testing
      framework with champion/challenger strategies.
    - >-
      Executive dashboard: portfolio heatmaps, expected vs. realized ROI,
      compliance exceptions, vendor performance benchmarking, and what-if
      scenario planning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Auditable AI that predicts recovery likelihood and net ROI per case, then
    recommends the optimal assignment method and timing—integrated into existing
    repo/servicing workflows—to increase net recoveries 10–20%, cut cycle time
    15–25%, and reduce vendor costs and compliance risk within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop outcome data across multiple lenders and forwarders creates a
    unique training corpus for channel-and-timing optimization that single
    lenders or rule engines cannot match. Combined with native integrations into
    repo/servicing platforms and a compliance-first, fully auditable AI layer,
    RecoverIQ delivers explainable recommendations that pass audits and improve
    with scale.
