  problem:
    - >-
      Engineering teams struggle to achieve high-confidence coverage for
      rare-but-critical GNSS outages, multipath, spoofing/jamming resilience,
      wind/turbulence extremes, terrain proximity, and procedure variations
      within RTCA/FAA/IMO/IEC regulatory envelopes.
    - >-
      Manual scenario authoring for SIL/HIL is slow and brittle; typical teams
      cover 10–25% of an operational hazard matrix in a program increment,
      leaving tail risks under-tested.
    - >-
      Regression test suites grow without clear coverage metrics; gaps remain
      invisible until late flight/sea trials, causing schedule slips and costly
      rework.
    - >-
      Certification evidence (DO-178C/DO-254/DO-160, AC 20-138D, DO-229/DO-253,
      IEC 61108) is burdensome; assembling traceable test artifacts that map to
      requirements and environmental profiles is labor-intensive.
    - >-
      HIL benches and GNSS simulators are underutilized (often <40% utilization)
      due to test definition bottlenecks, scheduling, and slow iteration.
    - >-
      Data silos (telemetry, procedure databases, weather/terrain sources)
      hinder reuse; teams cannot easily derive edge cases from real-world
      operations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Coverage-driven Scenario Generation: AI proposes and prioritizes scenarios
      to close measurable gaps against a configurable hazard/operational profile
      matrix.
    - >-
      Regulatory Profiles Library: Pre-built templates aligned to
      DO-178C/DO-254/DO-160 conditions and GNSS MOPS (e.g., DO-229/DO-253) and
      IEC 61108 for maritime; configurable to program-specific PSAC/PHAC plans.
    - >-
      Connectors to SIL/HIL: Out-of-the-box adapters for dSPACE/NI/Speedgoat
      HIL, Spirent/Orolia/R&S GNSS simulators, Simulink/ANSYS SCADE, and common
      log formats; export to standard scenario schemas.
    - >-
      Adaptive Fuzzing and Active Learning: Automatically perturbs
      winds/turbulence, outages, geometry, procedures, and interference
      envelopes to uncover tail behaviors while maintaining regulatory bounds.
    - >-
      Traceability and Evidence: One-click generation of
      requirement-to-test-to-result matrices, MC/DC linkages (where applicable),
      and audit-ready reports.
    - >-
      Secure Deployment: Air-gapped on-prem appliance or
      GovCloud/FedRAMP-aligned managed service; role-based access,
      ITAR/EAR-aware data handling.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-generated, certification-aligned edge-case scenarios that expand SIL/HIL
    coverage by 30–60% within 90 days, reduce escaped defects by 25–40%, and
    produce traceable evidence packages that accelerate airworthiness and
    maritime approvals.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Coverage-first scenario generation with regulatory-aligned templates, deep
    integrations with leading GNSS/HIL vendors, and a growing proprietary corpus
    of anonymized telemetry-driven edge cases that competitors cannot easily
    replicate; coupled with audit-grade evidence automation that shortens
    certification timelines.

  character: >-
    Verification and systems leads at NAICS 334511 manufacturers who must prove
    guidance/navigation performance and safety under rare, high‑risk
    conditions—on schedule and budget.
  problem: >-
    External: Manual scenario design misses edge cases across GNSS/GPS outages,
    wind/turbulence, terrain, and procedure variations within regulatory
    profiles. Internal: Teams worry about unknown unknowns, late findings, and
    ballooning HIL/SIL time. Philosophical: Mission‑critical systems should be
    tested against the world as it is, not as we hope it to be.
  guide: >-
    We understand certification pressure and the cost of missed edge cases. Our
    GNC/V&V experts and AI scenario engine expand coverage in SIL/HIL for
    guidance, navigation, and sensor fusion—integrating with your benches while
    protecting IP and meeting typical aerospace regulatory profiles (e.g.,
    DO‑178C/ARP4754A/DO‑160).
  plan: >-
    1) Gap assessment: ingest current tests, hazards, and regulatory targets;
    deliver a coverage heatmap. 2) Generate: create curated, parameterized
    edge‑case libraries (GNSS outages, wind shear/turbulence, terrain/obstacle,
    procedure variants) with constraints and priors. 3) Integrate & prove: plug
    into SIL/HIL, run campaigns, track coverage KPIs, and auto‑generate
    audit‑ready reports. Agreement: secure data handling, repeatability,
    traceability, and optional tool‑qualification path.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 60‑minute pilot scoping and connect a sample SIL/HIL bench.
    Transitional: Request a sample scenario pack and the coverage‑heatmap
    template.
  success: >-
    Broader, risk‑driven coverage earlier; defects found before flight test;
    fewer certification findings; shorter cycles; defensible evidence packs; and
    more robust guidance/navigation performance in the real world.
  failure: >-
    Unknown edge cases slip through; flight tests uncover late defects;
    certification findings multiply; schedules and budgets overrun; safety and
    reputation are put at risk.
