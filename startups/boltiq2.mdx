leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Volatile, intermittent demand at the SKU/customer level (color/length/trim
      variations) causes either chronic stockouts or bloated inventory across
      10,000–250,000 SKUs.
    - >-
      Long, variable import lead times (fabric dyeing, ocean freight, customs,
      holidays) make classic reorder point methods inaccurate, driving high
      safety stock and missed service levels.
    - >-
      Current planning is spreadsheet- or ERP-native and lacks attribute-level
      modeling (style/color/size, roll/bolt lengths, dye lots, pack sizes),
      resulting in poor new-item forecasts and substitution handling.
    - >-
      Promotions, seasonal collections, and event spikes (e.g., Quilt Market,
      back-to-school, holiday) are not quantified, so planners either overbuy or
      miss sales.
    - >-
      Suppliers have MOQs, case packs, and price breaks that aren’t optimized
      against target fill rates and cash constraints, leading to suboptimal POs.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ERP, WMS, EDI 850/855/856, eCommerce B2B portals) slows
      planning cycles and hides true vendor performance.
    - >-
      Planners spend excessive time cleansing data, building manual POs, and
      chasing exceptions; leadership lacks visibility into ROI of inventory
      (DIO, turns, aging, obsolescence).
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click data integration to ERP/WMS/EDI (historical
      orders/shipments/returns, on-hand/on-order, lead times, supplier
      constraints).
    - >-
      Probabilistic demand forecasting at SKU x customer/channel using
      hierarchical and intermittent demand models; automatic transfer learning
      for new items via attribute analogs (style/color/size/material).
    - >-
      Service-level–driven safety stock and reorder point optimization with
      variable lead time distributions and calendar effects (CNY, port
      congestion, holidays).
    - >-
      PO proposal engine that respects MOQs, case packs, price breaks,
      dye-lot/bolt constraints, vendor calendars, and budget/cash caps;
      generates ranked buy lists and multi-supplier options.
    - >-
      Exception-driven workflow (stockout risk, aging/slow movers, excess, late
      POs, forecast bias, vendor underperformance) with auto-recommendations and
      approvals.
    - >-
      Promotion and seasonality uplift modeling with scenario planning (what-if
      lead time, target fill rate changes, event impact).
    - >-
      Vendor collaboration portal (optional) for confirming POs, sharing
      forecasts, and improving ASN/lead time accuracy.
    - >-
      Analytics: forecast accuracy, service level, fill rate, DIO, turns,
      backorders, expedite cost, planner productivity; ROI tracking dashboards.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that forecasts by SKU x customer and generates ready-to-issue PO
    proposals that hit target fill rates with 20–35% less inventory—built
    specifically for piece goods and notions (roll/bolt lengths, dye lots, pack
    sizes, MOQs, seasonal collections). Time-to-value in 60–90 days with
    ERP-native connectors.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specialized planning engine for piece goods and notions (roll/bolt
    lengths, dye lots, seasonal collections, MOQs/case packs) plus prebuilt

    Inventory and purchasing leaders at piece goods, notions, and dry goods
    wholesalers who must hit service levels with less inventory and less manual
    work.
  problem: >-
