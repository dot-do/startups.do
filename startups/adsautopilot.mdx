leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers waste budget on out-of-stock or low-margin items because ads are
      not tied to live inventory or margin data.
    - >-
      Generic Performance Max/Advantage+ setups lack vertical nuance (e.g.,
      collectibles vs. evergreen toys), leading to poor targeting and creative
      mismatch.
    - >-
      Feed quality issues (missing GTIN, brand, age-grade, policy flags) cause
      disapprovals and low impressions; most SMBs lack the skill/time to fix
      them.
    - >-
      Local stores struggle to reach the right radius; either too narrow (low
      volume) or too broad (low intent), hurting ROAS and foot traffic.
    - >-
      Budget and bid decisions do not account for margin tiers, seasonality (Q4
      peaks), preorders, or clearance, producing inefficient ad spend.
    - >-
      In-house management is time-consuming (5–10 hours/week) and agency
      retainers are expensive ($1,000–$3,000/month) with mixed ROI for SMBs.
    - >-
      Lack of visibility into product-level profitability and store-level
      performance results in reactive decision-making.
    - >-
      Co-op/brand MDF opportunities are underutilized due to complex
      proof-of-performance and creative compliance requirements.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-click connectors sync inventory, price, margin, and store data to
      Google Merchant Center and Meta Catalog with automated feed cleanup.
    - >-
      AI budget and bid engine allocates spend by stock status, margin tiers,
      velocity, and seasonality across Google PMax/Shopping/LIA and Meta
      Catalog/Advantage+.
    - >-
      Smart Radius models catchment area per store using travel-time, population
      density, and historical conversion distance to optimize local reach.
    - >-
      Policy-safe creative and product set automation: dynamic ad groups for new
      arrivals, clearance, preorders, and high-margin items.
    - >-
      Continuous experimentation layer (A/B product set rules, radius bands,
      creatives) with guardrails to maintain target ROAS and budget pacing.
    - >-
      Retail playbooks by vertical (tabletop, RC, puzzles, STEM toys, TCGs) with
      prebuilt rules for launch windows, MAP, and collectibles.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn inventory, margin, and local radius into autopilot ad performance.
    Launch in under 60 minutes and automatically run Google PMax/LIA and Meta
    Catalog campaigns that prioritize in-stock, high-margin, and
    locally-relevant products—improving ROAS 20–40% vs. baseline while cutting
    management time by 70%.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized data and playbooks for hobby/toy/game retail plus a Smart
    Radius model tuned to local catchments. Prebuilt GTIN catalogs, seasonality
    profiles (Q4 toys, release calendars for TCGs), and margin-aware rules let
    us launch optimized campaigns in under an hour with minimal retailer
    effort—hard for generic adtech or agencies to replicate quickly. Co-op
    workflows and distributor partnerships further reduce retailer friction and
    acquisition cost.
