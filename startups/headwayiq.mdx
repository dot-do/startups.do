leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Agencies spend hours daily exporting AVL/GTFS-RT data to Excel/BI to
      calculate OTP and headway adherence; findings arrive too late to influence
      same-day service.
    - >-
      Dispatchers see problems (bunching, late trips) but lack data-driven,
      route-specific playbooks suggesting concrete actions
      (hold/skip/short-turn/insert trips) with predicted impact.
    - >-
      Schedules are updated infrequently and do not reflect recurring
      micro‑delay patterns by stop/daypart; planners lack precise, stop-level
      evidence to justify timepoint and runtime changes.
    - >-
      Existing ITS/CAD/AVL tools surface alerts but not prioritized hotspot
      lists with root causes (e.g., dwell vs. traffic vs. blocking) and
      quantified ROI of fixes.
    - >-
      Political and rider pressure to improve reliability is high, while staff
      and budgets are constrained; manual analysis cannot scale across all
      routes daily.
    - >-
      KPIs are inconsistently defined across departments (OTP vs. headway
      adherence vs. excess wait time); reporting is reactive and fragmented.
    - >-
      Service equity audits and Title VI considerations require evidence showing
      how reliability improvements affect different neighborhoods; assembling
      this is laborious.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated daily ingestion and QA of GTFS static/RT, CAD/AVL, APC, traffic,
      and weather; normalize and reconcile trip/vehicle IDs to produce a clean,
      trusted dataset.
    - >-
      Hotspot detection engine ranks routes/segments/timepoints by impact on
      OTP/HTA/EWT with confidence scores; identifies root causes (dwell vs.
      traffic vs. blocking vs. relief).
    - >-
      Prescriptive Action Generator produces concrete proposals:
      hold/skip/short-turn/insert trip, adjust recovery, redistribute runtimes
      by stop/daypart, modify timepoints; each proposal includes predicted KPI
      lift and resource impact.
    - >-
      What-if simulator forecasts OTP/headway improvements and operator/resource
      implications before actions are approved; supports scenario comparisons.
    - >-
      1-click export of accepted actions to scheduling tools or dispatch systems
      via APIs; generate board-ready daily/weekly reliability reports and equity
      overlays.
    - >-
      Operational workflows: Slack/Teams/email alerts each morning with top 10
      hotspots and proposed actions; track action acceptance rate and realized
      vs. predicted impact.
    - >-
      Governance and audit: maintain a log of decisions, assumptions, and
      outcomes to support Title VI, labor consultations, and board
      communications.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From raw AVL/GTFS-RT to daily, prescriptive actions in one platform:
    HeadwayIQ pinpoints where and why reliability fails and automatically drafts
    dispatch and schedule changes with predicted impact, so agencies can improve
    OTP/headway adherence within weeks—not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A prescriptive, closed-loop reliability engine that not only diagnoses but
    drafts and simulates actions, integrated directly with dispatch and
    scheduling tools—continuously learning from outcomes across agencies to
    improve recommendations while encoding real-world policy and labor
    constraints.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Public bus transit agencies (urban and suburban) with 50–1,000+ buses;
      priority: agencies already publishing GTFS-RT and using CAD/AVL.
    - >-
      Contracted private operators (e.g., Transdev, Keolis, First Transit)
      managing multiple agency contracts seeking standardized reliability
      tooling.
    - >-
      Operations control centers and dispatch supervisors needing prescriptive,
      real-time action recommendations.
    - >-
      Scheduling and planning teams seeking daily, stop-level evidence to adjust
      runtimes, timepoints, recovery time, and interlining.
    - >-
      Service quality/performance analytics teams responsible for OTP/HTA/EWT
      targets and board reporting.
    - >-
      Agency IT/CTO offices needing secure integrations with CAD/AVL, APC,
      farebox, and data warehouse tools.
  channels:
    - >-
      Pilot-driven direct sales to mid-sized agencies (100–500 buses) with
      90-day paid pilots; success criteria agreed upfront (e.g., +8% OTP on 3
      corridors, -20% bunching events, <30-day time-to-value).
    - >-
      Partnerships with ITS/CAD/AVL vendors (Clever Devices, Trapeze, INIT,
      Avail) and planning platforms (Optibus, Swiftly) for co-selling and
      marketplace listings.
    - >-
      Cooperative procurement and piggybacking (e.g., Sourcewell, state
      cooperative contracts) to shorten RFP cycles.

  character: >-
    Transit operations managers, schedulers, and dispatch supervisors at bus and
    motor vehicle transit agencies (NAICS 485113) who must deliver reliable,
    on‑time service every day with finite vehicles, crews, and budget.
  problem: >-
    External: Service runs late, bunches, and misses trips; hotspots shift
    daily.

    Internal: Teams drown in spreadsheets and static reports, unsure what to fix
    first.

    Philosophical: Public transit should be predictably on time without
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We understand the daily pressure to keep buses on time and riders
    satisfied.

    Authority: Built by transit ops and data science practitioners; aligns with
    GTFS, CAD/AVL, and APC data; produces transparent, auditable
    recommendations.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your GTFS, CAD/AVL, and APC feeds (read‑only).

    2) Set OTP/KPI goals and operating rules.

    3) Each morning, receive ranked hotspots and auto‑drafted dispatch and
    schedule actions; review, approve, and export/share with ops and scheduling
    tools.

    Optional: Start with one depot or route family to prove value.
  callToAction: Book a 20‑minute demo and launch a 30‑day pilot on priority routes.
  success: >-
    - Clear daily OTP/KPI brief in minutes, not hours (OTP, headway adherence,
    bunching, dwell, missed trips).

    - Targeted actions: holds, headway re‑spacing, short‑turns (where policy
    allows), relief/timepoint tweaks, recovery adjustments.

    - Fewer missed trips and less bunching; steadier headways; more reliable
    service riders can trust.

    - Documented decisions, faster post‑day reviews, and continuous schedule
    improvements.
  failure: >-
    If you wait: delays and bunching persist; complaints grow; staff time drains
    into manual analysis; dispatch stays reactive; overtime and operator fatigue
    rise; OTP targets slip and funding/oversight risk increases.
