  problem:
    - >-
      Airlines face unpredictable disruption drivers (weather, ATC initiatives,
      maintenance, crew legality) that cascade into missed connections, delays,
      and cancellations, often detected too late to mitigate.
    - >-
      Current OCC/SOC tools are reactive and siloed (separate crew, aircraft,
      maintenance, network views), leading to slow manual coordination and
      suboptimal recovery plans.
    - >-
      Recovery decisions are constrained by complex regulations (FAR 117, EASA
      FTL), airport curfews, maintenance MEL/CDL limits, and gate/turn
      constraints—hard to model and optimize in real time.
    - >-
      Existing systems lack reliable early warning lead times and actionable,
      explainable recommendations that consider multi-objective trade-offs
      (cost, customer impact, completion factor, crew legality, on-time
      performance).
    - >-
      Disruptions materially increase controllable delay minutes, passenger
      misconnects, and reaccommodation costs, eroding NPS and operational
      margins.
  solution:
    - >-
      Always-on monitoring of weather, ATC programs (GDP/GS/AFP), fleet health,
      crew legality, gates, and curfews to predict disruption impact with 30–180
      minute lead time.
    - >-
      Digital twin of today’s operation that simulates propagation of
      disruptions across rotations, crew pairings, and bank structures.
    - >-
      Prescriptive recovery recommendations (tail swaps, targeted delays,
      selective cancellations, crew/aircraft reassignments, rolling banks) with
      multi-objective optimization (cost, completion factor, misconnects,
      premium pax, crew/legal).
    - >-
      “Shadow mode” and A/B evaluation to quantify impact before full adoption;
      decision support with explainability and constraint transparency.
    - >-
      Workflow integration with OCC tools (movement control, crew management,
      maintenance, AOC/ACARS, gate systems) for one-click plan execution and
      post-action monitoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict IRROPS before they cascade and prescribe legally compliant,
    cost-aware recovery plans across aircraft, crew, and network—reducing
    controllable delay minutes and cancellations while protecting connections
    and customer experience.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Airline operations leaders at scheduled passenger carriers (NAICS 481111):
    OCC/IOC directors, network operations, crew scheduling, dispatch, and
    station teams responsible for delivering the published schedule.
  problem: >-
    Weather, ATC constraints, and resource imbalances trigger IRROPS faster than
    teams can coordinate across siloed tools—leading to missed recovery windows,
    rolling delays, excess cancellations, crew timeouts, misplaced aircraft,
    rising costs, and dissatisfied passengers.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of protecting the schedule and the brand when
    minutes matter. IRROPS Early Warning & Recovery Recommender continuously
    monitors weather/ATC/fleet/crew and provides explainable, rules-aware
    recommendations (swaps, selective delays, protective cancels, crew/aircraft
    reassignments) aligned to your policies and constraints.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect and configure data feeds (schedule/flight status, fleet and
    maintenance, crew legality/rosters, weather/ATC). 2) Calibrate in shadow
    mode to tune thresholds, objectives, and approval flows; validate against
    historical IRROPS. 3) Go live with early alerts and ranked recovery options;
    track outcomes and continuously learn for faster, better decisions.
  callToAction: >-
    Schedule a 30‑minute demo or launch a limited-scope pilot (e.g., one hub or
    storm season) to validate impact with your playbooks and KPIs.
  success: >-
    Proactive detection, faster recoveries, protected crew legality, higher
    completion factor and OTP, fewer misconnects and cancellations, lower
    disruption cost per event, improved customer experience and operational
    confidence.
  failure: >-
    Remain reactive: cascading delays, preventable cancellations, stranded crews
    and aircraft, escalating costs, regulatory and brand risk, and enduring
    passenger frustration.
