  problem:
    - >-
      Newsrooms are inundated with hundreds of press releases weekly, forcing
      editors and reporters to spend 5–10 hours/week triaging and rewriting
      low-priority items.
    - >-
      Manual rewrites often miss necessary caveats, local context, and proper
      attribution, creating legal and trust risks (e.g., unmarked claims, lack
      of opposing views).
    - >-
      Existing LLM tools produce fluent drafts but lack newsroom-graded
      guardrails: sourcing, embargo handling, audit trails, and CMS-ready
      output.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size publishers struggle to cover everything; routine
      press-release items crowd out enterprise reporting.
    - >-
      Publishers need measurable productivity gains without sacrificing
      accuracy, brand voice, or compliance with ethics codes and style guides.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated transformation of press releases (email, PDF, DOCX, web links)
      into newsroom-ready briefs or long-form drafts that include attribution,
      context, caveats, and links to prior coverage.
    - >-
      Guardrails for newsroom ethics: automatic claim tagging, source
      attribution, conflict-of-interest flags, and suggested
      opposing/independent sources to contact.
    - >-
      Local-context enrichment: auto-inserts relevant local stats, prior
      coverage, and public data references; generates follow-up questions and
      quote requests.
    - >-
      Embargo and compliance handling with audit trails, version history, and
      editor approvals; outputs aligned to AP or custom style guides.
    - >-
      One-click publishing via CMS integrations (Arc XP, TownNews/BLOX CMS,
      WordPress VIP/NewsPack, Naviga) and push to Slack/Teams for editor review.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any press release into a newsroom-ready brief or draft in
    minutes—contextualized, attributed, caveated, and CMS-ready—while cutting
    desk time by 50–70% with measurable accuracy and auditability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Newsroom-grade guardrails and editorial evaluations baked into the model
    (attribution enforcement, caveat injection, and audit logs), plus deep CMS
    integrations and a proprietary, continuously growing dataset of
    editor-accepted press release rewrites tied to measurable acceptance and
    accuracy scores.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Metro and regional daily newspapers (50–300 newsroom staff) needing
      high-throughput brief creation.
    - >-
      Independent weeklies and small chains (5–30 newsroom staff) seeking
      efficiency with limited budgets.
    - >-
      Digital-native local outlets and nonprofit newsrooms focused on quick
      updates with minimal staff.
    - >-

      titles.
    - >-
      Wire desks/assignment editors triaging releases from public agencies,
      companies, schools, hospitals, law enforcement, and NGOs.
  channels:
    - >-
      Direct sales to publisher groups and chains; land-and-expand via
      chain-wide procurement.
    - >-
      CMS marketplaces and technical partnerships (Arc XP, TownNews, WordPress
      VIP/NewsPack, Naviga) for distribution and co-marketing.
    - >-
      Industry associations and conferences: News/Media Alliance, INMA, ONA,
      LMA; workshops and case-study webinars.
    - >-
      Bottom-up adoption via newsroom tools: Slack/Teams/Gmail add-ins with free
      trial and easy provisioning.
    - >-
      Pilot programs with ROI guarantees for mid-market metros; reference
      customers as lighthouse accounts.
    - >-
      Academic and nonprofit partnerships (journalism schools, Institute for
      Nonprofit News) for credibility and early adopters.
