  problem:
    - >-
      OEMs spend 1.5–3.0% of equipment revenue on warranty; adjudication is slow
      and inconsistent across dealers, inflating costs and customer downtime.
    - >-
      Claims arrive as unstructured text/photos from dealers; manual triage
      misses patterns, duplicates work, and delays approvals (cycle times often
      7–30 days).
    - >-
      Photos are often low quality; visible defects go undetected or require
      expert review, creating bottlenecks and high expert labor costs.
    - >-
      Root cause analysis relies on tribal knowledge scattered across service
      bulletins, PLM/ERP, and dealer notes; insights aren’t fed back fast enough
      to engineering/suppliers.
    - >-
      High “no-fault-found” (NFF) rates (5–15%) and unnecessary parts
      shipments/returns increase logistics and inventory costs.
    - >-
      Existing warranty systems handle workflows but lack domain-tuned,
      multi-modal AI that can accurately classify claims, extract
      symptoms/causes, and recommend diagnostics at scale.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize claims from dealer portals, emails, DMS, and
      ERP/warranty systems; auto-tag with equipment model, configuration,
      location, hours, and component taxonomy.
    - >-
      NLP models extract symptoms, failure modes, probable causes, and
      environmental context from free text; map to standardized fault codes and
      part numbers.
    - >-
      Computer vision inspects uploaded images for visible defects (cracks,
      leaks, wear, bent components, harness damage, corrosion) and flags
      low-quality photos with real‑time capture guidance.
    - >-
      Triage engine assigns claim category/severity, recommends next-best
      diagnostic steps and documents, and estimates approval thresholds or
      routing to expert.
    - >-
      Root-cause assistant links claims to known issues, service bulletins, and
      similar cases; proposes likely root causes with confidence scores and
      pushes feedback to PLM/quality teams.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: outcomes, parts returns, teardown reports, and
      technician feedback continuously improve models; governance dashboards
      track model drift and bias.
    - >-
      Secure integrations with SAP/Oracle/Salesforce/Tavant/Syncron and dealer
      management systems; SSO, audit trails, multi-language support.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce warranty cycle time and cost with an industry-tuned, multi‑modal AI
    that classifies claims, detects visible defects in images, extracts
    symptoms/causes, and recommends diagnostics—integrated with your warranty,
    PLM, and dealer systems.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, proprietary multi-modal dataset of agricultural defect images and
    claim narratives linked to parts and resolutions, combined with pre-built
    connectors to OEM systems and a domain taxonomy/knowledge graph. Early
    design partnerships with mid/large OEMs create performance advantages and
    switching costs via continuous learning on their fleets.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Warranty and service leaders at farm machinery OEMs and dealer networks who
    want faster, accurate claim triage, fewer repeat repairs, and lower warranty
    costs.
  problem: >-
    Backlogs, inconsistent narratives, and incomplete photos make manual triage
    slow and error-prone—causing misclassification, missed root causes, warranty
    leakage, dealer frustration, and costly downtime during critical seasons.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of noisy claims data and the pressure to get
    machines back in the field. Our domain-trained NLP + computer vision, built
    on ag equipment taxonomies, integrates with your DMS/ERP/PLM/QMS and keeps
    humans-in-the-loop with secure, auditable workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect claims, images, parts, and service sources. 2) Calibrate on
    historical data and your taxonomy; define business rules and thresholds. 3)
    Go live with assisted triage, ROI dashboard, and continuous learning—backed
    by data privacy, audit trails, and override controls.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 30-minute demo and launch a 4-week pilot on a subset of
    claims. Transitional: Request a free data readiness assessment and ROI
    estimate.
  success: >-
    Claims auto-classified; visible defects flagged; symptoms and likely causes
    extracted; recommended diagnostics delivered to techs; cycle times shrink;
    recoveries improve; engineering sees clearer failure trends; dealers and
    farmers experience faster fixes and higher uptime.
  failure: >-
    Without it, teams keep drowning in manual review, repeat repairs,
    misdiagnosed cases, avoidable parts and labor spend, missed trend detection,
    late recalls, and machines sitting idle when they’re needed most.
