  problem:
    - >-
      High sensitivity of mushrooms to climate swings causes yield loss: 1–2
      hours out-of-range temperature/RH/CO2 during pinning can reduce
      first-flush yield by 3–7%.
    - >-
      Existing room controllers follow static setpoints; phase transitions
      (spawn run → pinning → fruiting) require nuanced ramps and airflow that
      many teams manage manually, increasing inconsistency across rooms and
      shifts.
    - >-
      Head growers can’t be in every room: late-night deviations or equipment
      faults often go unnoticed for 2–6 hours, leading to overlay, long stipes,
      bacterial blotch, or dry caps.
    - >-
      Energy spend is 20–35% of COGS in climate-intensive farms; lack of
      coordinated control across heating, humidification, CO2 purge, and
      dehumidification wastes 10–25% energy.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented (loggers, PLCs, spreadsheets). No single “phase-aware”
      view ties environment to yield, BE%, contamination events, or flush timing
      to drive continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Training new staff takes months; tacit knowledge of ramp rates, CO2
      thresholds, and airflow strategies is not codified, leading to variability
      and higher labor cost.
  solution:
    - >-
      Continuously ingest temp/RH/CO2/airflow/differential pressure and
      equipment states; compare in real time to phase-specific target bands and
      ramp plans.
    - >-
      Recommend or automatically apply safe, bounded setpoint changes (e.g., CO2
      purge rate, supply air temp, humidification duty cycle) with configurable
      guardrails and mandatory approvals where required.
    - >-
      Smart ramping during phase changes (spawn run → pinning → fruiting) to
      avoid shocking mycelium—rate-limited adjustments and automated pre-emptive
      steps before known high-risk events (e.g., after watering/casing).
    - >-
      Anomaly detection for contamination risk and equipment faults (e.g., stuck
      damper, failed solenoid, sensor drift), with prioritized alerts,
      escalation workflows, and on-call schedules.
    - >-
      Phase-aware playbooks: checklists and SOP prompts tied to real-time
      conditions (e.g., increase airflow if CO2 > 1200 ppm for 15 min during
      pinning).
    - >-
      Energy optimizer: coordination across
      heating/cooling/dehumidification/humidification to minimize kWh/kg while
      respecting biological constraints.
    - >-
      Yield and BE% improvement analytics linking climate adherence to outcomes
      per room, flush, and strain; benchmarking across rooms and sites.
    - >-
      SCADA/PLC integrations (Fancom, Christiaens, Allen-Bradley, Siemens,
      Ignition) plus API for data export; works with existing sensors where
      possible.
    - >-

      tamper-proof audit logs for food safety and certification.

    trails, guardrails, and seamless integration to existing controllers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Mushroom farm owners and grow-room managers who want predictable flushes
    without babysitting every room.
  problem: >-
    External: Rooms drift off targets across spawn run, pinning, and fruiting.
    Internal: You worry about missed windows, lost yield, and 2 a.m. alarms.
    Philosophical: Growing great mushrooms shouldn’t require guesswork.

    recommends—or safely applies—setpoint changes with guardrails and rollback.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect to your sensors/controls. 2) Set cultivar-specific phase targets
    and safety limits. 3) Let the AI tune setpoints, send clear alerts, and
    provide steps to correct drift.

    Direct: Book a demo or start a pilot. Transitional: Download the
    phase-target checklist and alert playbook.
  success: >-
    Stable, phase-accurate climate; tighter pinsets; higher yield and quality;
    fewer emergency checks; lower energy waste; a confident, data-driven team.
  failure: >-
    Stop losing yield to climate drift, missed pinning windows, condensation

      Monitor each room by crop phase, auto‑tune safe setpoints, and get
      prioritized alerts to protect pinsets, yield, and quality.
    ctaText: Get a demo
    ctaHref: /demo
  problem:
    - Small climate drifts derail pinning and reduce yield.
    - Late or noisy alerts lead to lost flushes and higher contamination risk.
    - 'Manual setpoint tuning is constant, labor‑heavy, and error‑prone.'
    - Data is scattered across sensors and controllers with no phase context.
    - Over‑ventilation and humidification waste energy and profit.
    - 'Hard to standardize practices across rooms, shifts, and sites.'
  solution:
    - 'Continuous monitoring mapped to Spawn, Pinning, and Cropping targets.'
    - >-
      AI compares live readings to phase targets and forecasts drift before it
      hurts yield.
    - Recommends or applies safe setpoint changes within guardrails you control.
    - 'Prioritized, actionable alerts with root‑cause hints and escalation.'
    - >-
