leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Late-stage ECOs caused by manufacturability or assembly issues in frames,
      cabinets, and harnesses drive delays (typical 10–25% of ECOs traced to
      DFM; each ECO costs $1k–$10k and adds 2–10 days).
    - >-
      Inconsistent, tribal design rules across plants and suppliers lead to
      variable quality and rework (especially in Elkhart-area contract supply
      chains).
    - >-
      Manual design reviews miss cross-assembly issues: misaligned frame holes,
      unreachable fasteners, harness bend-radius violations, cabinet
      panelization errors, tool clearance issues.
    - >-
      Prototype cycles are used to find problems that could be detected in CAD,
      inflating cost and time-to-release by 2–6 weeks.
    - >-
      Supplier PPAP/FAI packages often fail on first pass due to unclear or
      unenforced DFM rules, causing line shortages and expedite costs.
    - >-
      Material waste in cabinet panel cutting and excessive weld/fastener
      operations due to non-optimized designs (2–6% waste typical without
      panelization-aware DFM).
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload or auto-capture CAD assemblies (SolidWorks, Inventor, Creo, STEP)
      and run AI-augmented DFM/assembly checks using RV-specific rule libraries
      for frames, cabinets, and harnesses.
    - >-
      Return annotated 3D issues with callouts, risk scores, suggested fixes,
      and estimated impact on assembly time, cost, and material use.
    - >-
      Simulate key assembly sequences for reachability and tool access; verify
      harness routing rules (bend radius, clip spacing, edge protection) and
      cabinet panelization against standard sheet sizes/tooling.
    - >-
      Provide PPAP/FAI-ready reports for suppliers and a web portal to pre-check
      designs before submission.
    - >-
      Integrate with PDM/PLM (SolidWorks PDM, Autodesk Vault, PTC Windchill) to
      enforce checks on release and maintain rule versions per plant/supplier.
    - >-
      Offer on-prem or VPC deployment with SOC 2-ready security controls for
      IP-sensitive environments.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven DFM and assembly check specialized for RV frames, cabinets, and
    harnesses that flags and annotates issues directly in CAD/PDM, with plant-
    and supplier-specific rule packs. Cuts late ECOs by 25–40%, reduces rework
    and scrap by 10–30%, and shortens release-to-production by 1–3 weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary, RV-specific DFM/assembly rule packs and annotated datasets
    linking CAD issues to real ECO/rework/warranty outcomes, enabling higher
    detection accuracy and ROI than generic DFM tools. Tight CAD/PDM and
    supplier portal integrations create process lock-in and data network effects
    as rules improve with usage.

    and on cost.
  problem: >-
    Hidden DFM/DFA risks in CAD—misaligned holes, unreachable welds, cabinet
    interferences, tight clearances, and invalid harness bend/clip rules—cause
    late rework, line stoppages, and missed ship dates, leaving teams anxious
    and reactive.

    trailers and campers, with domain rules for welded frames, casework, and
    harness routing; we understand shop-floor realities and map checks to real
    fixtures, tools, and supplier limits.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload CAD (assemblies/parts) and build constraints; 2) Receive annotated
    issues with severity, root cause, and recommended fixes within minutes; 3)
    Iterate to a pass score and release to PLM/suppliers.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Start a pilot—upload a sample assembly today. Transitional: Book a
    20-minute demo or download a sample annotated report.
  success: >-
    First-pass builds that fit and finish right, faster engineering cycles,
    fewer ECOs, lower scrap and overtime, confident release gates, and on-time
    delivery across models.
  failure: >-
    Keep discovering issues on the line—missed build slots, fire drills, costly
    rework, supplier delays, warranty claims, and burned-out teams.
