leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Inconsistent product gradation causes rejected loads or price downgrades;
      many sites experience 5–15% off-spec tons per month.
    - >-
      Crusher setpoints (CSS/speed) are manually tuned per shift, leading to
      variability in P80/P50 and excess fines or oversize.
    - >-
      Lab sieve results arrive hours/days after production, so corrective
      actions lag and create large volumes of out-of-tolerance stock.
    - >-
      Blend decisions across multiple stockpiles are heuristic and constrained
      by operator experience, not optimization, causing higher cost per ton and
      inventory imbalances.
    - >-
      Energy per ton is higher than necessary due to suboptimal crusher settings
      and recirculating loads (kWh/t not tracked against PSD targets).
    - >-
      Limited integration between on-belt PSD sensors, belt scales, SCADA/PLC,
      and QC/LIMS; data silos prevent closed-loop control.
    - >-
      Frequent rehandle/re-crush and loader hours to fix gradation, increasing
      wear, fuel, and labor costs.
    - >-
      Shortage of experienced process/QC engineers across shifts; best practices
      are not consistently applied.
  solution:
    - >-
      Data fusion: ingest on-belt PSD, belt scales, crusher settings, and lab
      sieve results; align by time/lot and calibrate PSD to lab truth.
    - >-
      Prescriptive control: recommend real-time crusher CSS/speed and feeder
      setpoints to keep live PSD within target bands; optional closed-loop to
      PLCs.
    - >-
      Blend optimization: MILP-based optimizer computes stockpile draw ratios to
      meet multi-sieve gradation specs with minimal cost and inventory risk.
    - >-
      What-if simulation: digital twin of the crushing and screening circuit to
      test settings, liner wear, and feed changes before applying.
    - >-
      Quality intelligence: dashboards with live spec conformance, P80
      variability, off-spec risk forecast, and automatic shift reports.
    - >-
      Alerting and workflows: notify when trends indicate drift (e.g., liner
      wear, screen blinding), and create recommended actions with ROI impact.
    - >-
      Edge + cloud architecture: site gateway for low-latency control and
      resilient operation; cloud for analytics, model management, and enterprise
      rollups.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit gradation targets at the lowest cost. StrataBlend AI fuses lab sieve
    data with on-belt PSD to prescribe crusher settings and optimal stockpile
    blends—reducing off-spec tons, energy per ton, and rehandle while increasing
    throughput and consistency across shifts.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Proprietary PSD-lab fusion and prescriptive control models trained on
    multi-site, multi-ore datasets; real-time blend optimization that respects
    sieve bands and inventory constraints; and OEM/sensor integrations that
    enable closed-loop control rather than advisory-only. Accumulated
    calibration curves and plant fingerprints become self-reinforcing moats as
    more sites join.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Aggregate plant managers, quarry operations leaders, and quality supervisors
    who want every load to hit gradation spec while maximizing throughput and
    margin.
  problem: >-
    - External: Variable feed and inconsistent crusher performance lead to
    out-of-spec gradations, rejects, and costly rehandle.

    - Internal: Tired of firefighting and guesswork on settings and blends,
    under pressure to meet demand and protect margin.

    - Philosophical: Hitting spec should be predictable—your lab sieve data and
    on-belt PSD should set the machines, not the other way around.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of out-of-spec loads, re-crush, penalties, and
    customer churn. Our team blends quarry process expertise with AI to turn lab
    sieve results and on-belt PSD into clear crusher settings and optimal
    stockpile blend recipes that meet spec and demand.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: Ingest lab sieve data and on-belt PSD; map to target products and
    specs.

    - Calibrate: Validate PSD accuracy, model crusher response, and set control
    limits.

    - Optimize & Run: Recommend setpoints and blend recipes to meet spec and
    orders; monitor compliance in a live dashboard.

    - De-risk: Start with a 30-day pilot at one site; clear success criteria;
    optional SCADA/LIMS integration.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a 30-minute demo; Start a 30-day pilot at one plant.

    - Transitional: Download sample reports and a spec-compliance checklist;
    Share a week of sieve + PSD data for a free baseline analysis.
  success: |-
    - Consistently hit gradation specs across products.
    - More tons per hour at target gradation with less re-crush and rehandle.
    - Lower cost and energy per compliant ton.
    - Fewer customer complaints and returns.
    - Confident, data-backed settings and blend decisions your team trusts.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing missed specs, reblends, and scramble loads.
    - Wasted operating hours and energy from re-crush.
    - Penalties, lost contracts, and eroded customer trust.
    - Stockpile imbalance and write-offs that drag margin.
