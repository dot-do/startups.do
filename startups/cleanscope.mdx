  problem:
    - >-
      Janitorial contractors spend 2–6 hours per bid manually measuring floor
      plans, calculating production rates, and building proposals, leading to
      high overhead and slow turnaround.
    - >-
      Estimations vary widely between estimators and jobs, creating inconsistent
      pricing and margin leakage of 5–15%.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size firms lack standardized labor and material benchmarks;
      they rely on outdated spreadsheets or generic proposal tools that don’t
      account for floor types, traffic levels, and scope nuances.
    - >-
      Walkthrough notes and photos are poorly captured and rarely codified into
      proposals or scopes of work, causing scope gaps and rework.
    - >-
      Customers (property managers) expect fast, professional, line-item
      proposals with clear inclusions/exclusions and SLAs; many contractors lose
      deals due to slow or unclear bids.
    - >-
      Linking estimates to actuals is rare; firms can’t calibrate production
      rates, so future bids don’t improve and profitability stays unpredictable.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI takeoff from floor plans (PDF, image, basic CAD) to detect areas, room
      types, floor types, and high-traffic zones.
    - >-
      Structured ingestion of walkthrough photos and voice notes; auto-extract
      cleaning tasks, frequencies, and special conditions.
    - >-
      Production-rate engine grounded in industry benchmarks (e.g., ISSA
      cleaning times) plus per-customer calibration from job actuals.
    - >-
      Auto-build material and consumable lists with vendor-ready SKUs and
      monthly usage forecasts.
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing module with overhead, burden, and target margin controls;
      instant what-if scenarioing by frequency, scope, and SLA.
    - >-
      Branded proposal and SOW generation with inclusions/exclusions, KPIs, and
      schedule, exportable to PDF/e-sign and CRM.
    - >-
      Bid-to-actual feedback loop: import timekeeping and work-order data to
      continuously refine labor coefficients and reduce estimation error.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From floor plans, walkthrough photos/notes, and scope, CleanScope AI
    generates calibrated labor hours, materials, and a priced, branded proposal
    in under 15 minutes—standardizing estimates, speeding bids by 4x, and
    improving margin predictability.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
