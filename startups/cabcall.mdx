leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High call volumes create long wait times and 5–20% call abandonment during
      peaks, directly reducing completed rides and revenue.
    - >-
      24/7/365 coverage requires multiple shifts; dispatcher wages ($20–35/hr
      NA) and turnover (30%+) increase costs and training burden.
    - >-
      Inconsistent fare quotes, address errors, and poor address disambiguation
      lead to mispricing, no-shows, and re-dispatching costs.
    - >-
      Manual driver assignment and callbacks slow time-to-assign (TTA) and hurt
      driver utilization and customer satisfaction.
    - >-
      Limited multilingual capability and accessibility support reduce service
      quality for key rider segments (tourists, seniors, ESL riders).
    - >-
      Legacy IVR systems deflect calls but rarely book end-to-end; human BPO is
      costly and quality is variable.
  solution:
    - >-
      Realtime voice agent for inbound calls that completes booking, fare
      quoting, address confirmation, and driver assignment; auto-handoff to
      human when needed with full call context.
    - >-
      Omnichannel chat agent (SMS, WhatsApp, Web Chat) that mirrors voice
      functionality with links/buttons for address confirmation and payment.
    - >-
      Native integrations with leading dispatch systems (e.g., iCabbi, Curb,
      TaxiCaller, MTData, Autocab) for create/quote/assign/update, plus
      webhooks/REST for custom systems.
    - >-
      Accurate fare engine integration: metered tariffs, zones, extras (airport
      fees, tolls, waiting time, night/surge), and promo code validation.
    - >-
      Confirmation and status messaging: SMS/WhatsApp with ride details, live
      ETA, driver details, and cancellation/modify links.
    - >-
      Operational guardrails: fallback scripts for outages, configurable booking
      policies, and human escalation thresholds.
    - >-
      30–45 day implementation plan: week 1 discovery and call flow design, week
      2–3 integration and test sandbox, week 4–5 pilot on limited DIDs and
      channels, week 6 cutover with 24/7 monitoring.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A domain-trained voice/chat dispatcher that answers in <1 second, books
    rides end-to-end, quotes accurate fares, assigns drivers via your existing
    dispatch system, and sends confirmations—cutting booking costs by 35–60%,
    reducing abandonment by 50%+, and improving driver utilization and customer
    CSAT without adding staff.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
