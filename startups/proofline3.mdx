  problem:
    - >-
      R&D teams spend 25–40% of analysis time fixing schema mismatches, missing
      metadata, units, and instrument idiosyncrasies before any science can
      happen.
    - >-
      Manual QC and EDA are brittle and non-reproducible; results cannot be
      regenerated on demand for audits or peer review.
    - >-
      No CI/CD for data or analyses; data contracts are absent, drift is
      detected late, and defect leakage into downstream analyses is common.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (GxP, GLP, ISO 17025) requires audit trails,
      validation documentation, and change control that most teams cannot
      sustain.
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling across ELN/LIMS/SDMS, notebooks, and storage leads to
      duplicated effort, inconsistent versions, and slow time-to-insight.
    - >-
      Scientists and data engineers lack domain-specific validation libraries
      and templates for common instruments and assays, leading to bespoke,
      one-off code.
  solution:
    - >-
      Provide declarative data contracts and validation templates for scientific
      file formats, instruments, and assays (e.g., CSV, HDF5, mzML, FASTQ,
      NetCDF), including units and ontology checks.
    - >-
      Automate EDA and report generation via reproducible notebooks (Jupyter/R)
      compiled to versioned reports (Quarto) with parameterized runs and
      snapshots.
    - >-
      Implement CI/CD for data and analysis: Git-based workflows, containerized
      pipelines, environment pinning, and automated tests on every commit and
      dataset drop.
    - >-
      Dataset versioning and lineage using DVC or lakeFS, with metadata capture
      and dataset diffs for auditability.
    - >-
      Data drift and anomaly detection with alerting to Slack/Teams; SLOs for
      pipeline success and data quality thresholds.
    - >-
      Integrations with ELN/LIMS/SDMS, cloud/object stores (S3, GCS, Azure
      Blob), warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and orchestration
      (Dagster/Prefect/Airflow).
    - >-
      Compliance pack: audit trails, change control, access logs, and validation
      documentation aligned to GxP/GLP/ISO 17025.
    - >-
      Managed service plus professional services for onboarding, custom
      validators, and instrument adapters.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate scientific data QA/QC and reproducible analysis with
    domain-specific validations and CI/CD so teams cut data defects by up to 80%
    and reduce time-to-insight by 30–50%, with audit-ready reports in under 2
    weeks.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Verticalized validation libraries and instrument adapters curated with
    design partners, plus a compliance-ready, CI/CD-in-a-box approach that
    produces audit-grade, reproducible reports with minimal setup; open-source
    validators drive bottom-up adoption while enterprise add-ons and compliance
    packs create a strong moat.

  problem:
    - Inconsistent data triggers rework and delays.
    - Manual QA/QC doesn’t scale and misses issues.
    - Analyses aren’t reproducible across people or time.
    - No end‑to‑end audit trail for reviewers or regulators.
    - 'Reports are manual, slow, and hard to standardize.'
    - Pipelines break without CI; changes aren’t tested.
    - Data drift and anomalies go unnoticed in ongoing studies.
  solution:
    - Automated validation and data contracts catch errors at ingest.
    - Statistical QC and anomaly detection flag issues early.
    - Push‑button EDA and standardized HTML/PDF reports.
    - 'Versioned data, code, and environments for full reproducibility.'
    - CI/CD runs tests on every change and builds reports from source.
    - 'Lineage, metadata, and approvals create an audit‑ready trail.'
    - 'Integrates with LIMS/ELN, cloud storage, and notebooks.'
  features:
    - 'Data contracts and schema checks (types, ranges, constraints)'
    - 'QC test suites for completeness, consistency, duplicates'
    - 'Drift, outlier, and anomaly detection with thresholds'
