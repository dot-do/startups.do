leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High undeliverable-as-addressed (UAA) rates (3–10%) increase postage,
      print, and customer support costs for directory and mailing list
      publishers.
    - >-
      Stale addresses and missed movers reduce list value and harm client ROI;
      updates are often quarterly or slower without automated NCOA workflows.
    - >-
      Fragmented toolchain (separate vendors for CASS, geocoding, and NCOALink)
      leads to integration overhead, inconsistent outputs, and weak
      auditability.
    - >-
      Loss of USPS postage discounts due to missing DPV, RDI, ZIP+4, eLOT, and
      carrier route data; poor presort performance.
    - >-
      Inconsistent address normalization across sources causes duplicate
      entities, fractured households, and flawed territory/geospatial analytics.
    - >-
      Lack of enterprise-grade SLAs, compliance, and audit trails tailored to
      publishers selling data onward (chain-of-custody).
    - >-
      Slow, manual batch jobs delay list releases and client deliveries; limited
      streaming/real-time options for dynamic directories.
    - >-
      Difficult to quantify and prove data hygiene improvements to customers;
      limited KPIs and defensible reporting.
  solution:
    - >-
      CASS Cycle O-compliant address validation with DPV, RDI, ZIP+4, carrier
      route, eLOT, LACSLink, and SuiteLink append.
    - >-
      Integrated NCOALink 18/48-month updates (via licensed Full Service
      Provider partner) with automated PAF collection and renewal workflows.
    - >-
      Rooftop-first geocoding and address point interpolation with precision
      codes (rooftop, parcel centroid, interpolated, ZIP+4 centroid) and geohash
      output.
    - >-
      AI-driven normalization and deduplication (household and entity-level)
      tuned for publisher datasets; configurable blocking/matching rules.
    - >-
      Batch (SFTP/S3/Snowflake) and real-time REST API; streaming via Kafka
      connectors; push-button reprocessing for deltas.
    - >-
      Compliance-grade audit: lineage, change logs, PAF records, USPS-required
      reporting, and immutable processing receipts.
    - >-
      Publisher-focused dashboards: deliverability score, DPV-confirmed rate,
      UAA risk, mover match rate, geocode precision distribution, and ROI
      reports.
    - >-
      Data outputs optimized for downstream postal and analytics workflows
      (CSV/Parquet/NDJSON; schema for presort; BigQuery/Snowflake connectors).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    One-stop, CASS-certified, AI-enhanced address hygiene for publishers:
    normalize, validate, geocode, and apply NCOA updates with audit-ready
    outputs that reduce UAA by 30–50%, unlock postal discounts, and deliver
    rooftop-precision geocodes at batch scale or via low-latency APIs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Publisher-tuned AI normalization and dedup models trained on multi-source
    publisher data with feedback loops from NCOA and UAA outcomes; audit-grade
    lineage and PAF automation purpose-built for list publishers reduce
    compliance friction and switching costs. Coalescing USPS-postal data with
    rooftop/parcel geocodes in one pipeline avoids the multi-vendor drift
    competitors struggle with.
