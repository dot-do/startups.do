  problem:
    - >-
      Paper/clipboard HACCP logs are often backfilled or incomplete, risking
      non-compliance and fines; average store spends 3–6 hours/week on manual
      logs and audit prep.
    - >-
      Seafood is highly perishable with stricter temperature ranges (typically
      0–2°C/32–36°F for fresh fish); undetected excursions cause spoilage and
      shrink (commonly 1–3% of weekly seafood revenue).
    - >-
      Existing generic food safety tools don’t account for species-specific
      risks (histamine-forming species, shellfish storage, wet-ice handling,
      cross-contamination) leading to false alarms or missed events.
    - >-
      Audits require compiling scattered data from notebooks, probes, and staff;
      typical prep takes 6–10 hours/location per audit cycle and creates stress
      and operational disruption.
    - >-
      Staff turnover (30–60%/yr) leads to inconsistent logging, poor training
      retention, and gaps in daily/weekly cleaning and sanitation checks.
    - >-
      Limited real-time visibility across cases, chillers, and display units
      results in slow response to failures after-hours or during peak service.
    - >-
      Hardware challenges (sensor battery life, water ingress, connectivity in
      chilled/wet environments) cause gaps and mistrust in digital systems.
    - >-
      Multi-site operators lack standardized HACCP execution and roll-up
      reporting across locations, increasing compliance risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Deploy rugged, food-safe wireless temperature sensors and Bluetooth probe
      workflows for cases, walk-ins, and display units; automatic readings every
      2–5 minutes with offline buffering.
    - >-
      AI anomaly detection calibrated for seafood (species, display method,
      icing cycles) to catch subtle drifts before excursions; alerting with
      escalation and guided corrective actions.
    - >-
      Digital HACCP: daily/weekly/monthly checklists (temp logs,
      cleaning/sanitizing, receiving checks, shellfish tags), with reminders,
      photos, and signatures; multilingual prompts for high-turnover teams.
    - >-
      Audit-ready package generation: one-click FDA/EU-compliant HACCP logs,
      CAPAs, calibration records, and incident traceability with immutable
      timestamps and access logs.
    - >-
      Predictive insights: temperature stability score by unit, MTBF trends, and
      recommended maintenance windows to reduce downtime.
    - >-
      Multi-site dashboard with benchmarking, compliance scorecards, and
      centralized policy/threshold management.
    - >-
      Hardware-as-a-service option with pre-configured sensors, cellular hub
      fallback, and battery replacements to ensure 99.5%+ data capture uptime.
    - >-
      Integrations: refrigeration controllers (e.g., Danfoss/Carel),
      SMS/voice/email alerting, SIEM/compliance exports, and API for enterprise
      BI.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Seafood-specialized, always-on HACCP automation that cuts compliance admin
    by 70%, reduces temperature-related seafood shrink by 20–40%, and generates
    audit-ready reports in minutes—not days—using AI tuned to species-specific
    risk profiles and retail seafood workflows.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A seafood-specialized dataset and models that predict spoilage risk and
    shelf-life impact by species and display method, combined with
    hardware-agnostic integrations and audit-grade, immutable logs. Early
    insurer partnerships and refrigeration-service distribution create
    defensible switching costs and preferential economics.
