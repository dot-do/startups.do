  problem:
    - >-
      Baggage Reconciliation Systems (BRS) generate high volumes of exceptions
      (e.g., late bags, tag read errors, no-show passenger bags, transfer
      misconnect risk, container mismatch) that are triaged manually, delaying
      resolution and increasing mishandled bags.
    - >-
      Stakeholder fragmentation (airline hub control, ground handler, BHS
      control room, security) causes slow handoffs and unclear ownership,
      leading to extended Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and knock-on delays.
    - >-
      Inconsistent or outdated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) across
      stations lead to variable decisions and non-compliance with IATA
      Resolution 753 and airline policies.
    - >-
      Limited predictive capability; current BRS/BHS tools are reactive and
      siloed (IT vs OT), causing preventable jams and misroutes to escalate.
    - >-
      Auditability and reporting are weak; incident root-cause analysis is
      manual, making it hard to prove improvements or comply with
      regulators/customers.
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time exception triage: Ingests BRS/BHS/AODB/DCS/messaging
      (BSM/BTM/BPM) to classify exceptions and prioritize by risk-to-departure
      and passenger impact.
    - >-
      Actionable recommendations: AI + rules engine proposes next-best actions
      (e.g., re-route bag, open manual chute, dispatch runner, offload U/S bag)
      with confidence scores and SOP references.
    - >-
      Closed-loop orchestration: Assigns tasks to the right stakeholder (ramp
      crew, sorter operator, airline control) via mobile/desktop; captures
      confirmations and outcomes for audit.
    - >-
      Predictive risk scoring: Anticipates misconnects, wrong-load, and jam
      hotspots using flight times, gate changes, belt load, weather, and
      historic patterns.
    - >-
      Compliance and analytics: Automated R753 traceability, exception
      root-cause analytics, and performance reporting by station, airline,
      flight, and handler.
    - >-
      What-if and seasonal tuning: Simulates peak scenarios and recommends
      staffing or sort plan tweaks to prevent exception surges.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce mishandled bags and clear baggage jams faster by turning BRS
    exceptions into orchestrated, closed-loop actions. ReconcileAI triages
    exceptions in real time, predicts misconnects, recommends playbook steps,
    and coordinates all stakeholders—cutting exception MTTR by 40–60% and
    lowering mishandled bag rates by 15–30% within one peak season while
    improving IATA R753 compliance and on-time departures.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vendor-agnostic, cross-stakeholder orchestration with a proprietary
    exception ontology and closed-loop action framework, plus a growing
    multi-airport dataset that enables superior benchmarking and model
    performance. Pre-certified connectors shorten deployments from months to
    weeks, and our playbook library embeds best-practice SOPs tailored by
    station, creating a defensible switching cost beyond basic BRS/BHS features.
