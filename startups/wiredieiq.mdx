  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned wire breaks from die wear create costly downtime (typically 2–6
      hours/event at $3k–$8k/hour lost contribution margin). Plants lack
      reliable early-warning signals.
    - >-
      Die life varies significantly with reduction schedule, speed, lube health,
      and material; rule-of-thumb tonnage limits are inaccurate, leading to
      premature changeouts (waste) or late changeouts (breaks).
    - >-
      Regrind and new die purchasing are reactive; plants pay rush
      fees/expedites and carry excess die inventory due to poor forecasting.
    - >-
      Data relevant to die wear is siloed across PLCs (speed, loads), QA
      (diameter/oval), maintenance (die IDs, regrinds), and lube systems; few
      plants have integrated models to convert this to actionable schedules.
    - >-
      OEE is eroded by non-productive changeovers and quality drift as dies wear
      (increased ovality/surface defects).
  solution:
    - >-
      Data ingestion from existing sources: tonnage counters, capstan/line
      speed, motor current/torque, pass schedule, material grade/diameter,
      inline diameter/ovality gauges, lubricant condition (temperature,
      concentration, consumption), and die history (usage/regrinds).
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML models estimate die wear rate and remaining useful
      life (RUL) per die, pass, and material, using reduction schedule, speed,
      lube health, and thermal/friction signals.
    - >-
      Scheduler generates changeout windows aligned to production plan,
      minimizing unplanned stops and clustering changeovers to reduce setup
      loss.
    - >-
      Inventory and procurement module forecasts regrind/new die demand by ID
      and size, triggers PO/regrind orders in ERP/CMMS, and optimizes safety
      stock by lead time and usage variability.
    - >-
      Alerting and what-if: early-break risk alerts; simulate impact of speed or
      lube setpoint changes on die life and throughput.
    - >-
      Closed-loop improvement: track post-changeout outcomes and re-train models
      for each line/material to continuously improve accuracy.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Predict die wear and remaining life with line-specific physics-informed AI,
    then schedule optimal changeouts and regrinds to cut wire breaks 30–50%,
    reduce die cost 10–20%, and lift OEE 3–7%—with automated purchase/regrind
    plans so you never run out of the right die at the right time.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-plant dataset linking die IDs, regrind history, and actual break
    events with process conditions, enabling accurate, line-specific RUL
    predictions; coupled with an integrated scheduler–procurement engine that
    converts predictions into avoided downtime and hard cost savings—difficult
    for generic PdM tools or single-plant solutions to replicate.

    who must hit throughput and quality while controlling die spend.
  problem: >-
    Unseen die wear causes surprise wire breaks, downtime, scrap, and missed
    shipments; manual logs and guesswork lead to over/underuse of dies—you
    shouldn’t have to gamble on die life.

    We understand a single break can wreck a shift. Our AI, trained on tonnage,
    reduction schedules, speeds, lube health, die geometry, and history,
    delivers clear, trusted predictions proven to cut breaks and cost.

    1) Connect line/quality data and die history; 2) Predict remaining life and
    break risk per die, simulate schedules; 3) Auto‑generate changeout windows
    plus regrind/purchase plan, push to CMMS/ERP with alerts.

    stops; 5–10% longer die life; lower scrap and lube use; right‑sized die
    inventory and regrinds; on‑time delivery and confident schedules.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting—mid‑run die failures, emergency changeovers, wasted
    regrinds, excess die stock, safety risks, overtime, and unhappy customers.
