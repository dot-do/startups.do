leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High annual wine club churn (typically 25–35%) erodes predictable DTC
      revenue and tasting room traffic.
    - >-
      Acquiring a new club member costs an estimated $120–$250; reacquisition
      after churn is slower and more expensive than retention.
    - >-
      Wineries lack early warning signals (30–60 days pre-shipment) and rely on
      reactive, manual saves after members request cancellation.
    - >-
      Generic email blasts or blanket discounts train customers and compress
      margins without measurable incremental lift.
    - >-
      Data is fragmented across POS/e-comm (WineDirect, Commerce7, eCellar,
      Shopify) and channels (email/SMS), making timely, personalized outreach
      difficult.
    - >-
      Small DTC teams (often 1–3 people) struggle to scale 1:1 outreach, A/B
      test offers, and measure ROI rigorously.
    - >-
      SMS compliance (TCPA/A2P 10DLC) and consent management are complex;
      non-compliance risks fines and carrier filtering.
    - >-
      Most wineries cannot isolate incremental retention due to lack of holdouts
      and uplift-based targeting; reporting is vanity (opens/clicks) vs.
      business impact.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predictive churn scoring at member level using purchase cadence, club
      tenure, shipment acceptance/skip history, tasting room visits, email/SMS
      engagement, and support signals.
    - >-
      Uplift modeling to prioritize only members whose behavior is changeable by
      outreach, minimizing discount waste.
    - >-
      Automated, tailored save sequences aligned to shipment cycles: skip/delay
      options, downgrade plans, shipping credits, bonus pour/bottle, loyalty
      points, or tasting room experiences.
    - >-
      Consent-aware orchestration across email/SMS with frequency caps, quiet
      hours, and brand voice templates tested for wine audiences.
    - >-
      Experimentation framework with holdouts and multi-armed bandit testing to
      converge on best-performing offers by segment (e.g., tenure, AOV, varietal
      preferences).
    - >-
      ROI and attribution dashboards: incremental members saved, revenue and
      gross margin saved, payback period, model precision/recall, and opt-out
      rates.
    - >-
      One-click integrations with WineDirect/Commerce7 (members, orders, club
      data), SendGrid/Mailgun/Klaviyo, Twilio/Sinch, and Shopify (where
      applicable).
    - >-
      Onboarding playbooks: prebuilt segments and offer recipes (e.g.,
      first-shipment risk, post-skip risk, lapsed tasting room visitors).
    - >-
      Compliance guardrails: A2P 10DLC registration guidance, opt-in/opt-out
      syncing, footer management, and audit logs.
    - >-
      Portfolio view for multi-brand groups to benchmark risk and retention
      across properties.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce club churn 15–30% and increase LTV $120–$300 per member with
    winery-specific AI that predicts churn 30–60 days pre-shipment, targets only
    persuadable members, and triggers compliant, personalized save offers via
    email/SMS. Go live in 2 weeks with native WineDirect/Commerce7 integrations
    and clear, audited ROI.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Vertical-specific uplift modeling trained on winery club data and shipment
    cycles, plus a growing, anonymized benchmark dataset across wineries.
    Combined with native WineDirect/Commerce7 integrations, consent-aware
    orchestration, and pre-validated offer playbooks, we deliver measurable
    incremental retention with minimal team lift—difficult for generic marketing
    tools to replicate.
