  problem:
    - >-
      Firms spend 1.5–3.0 hours per client per season chasing documents,
      answering intake questions, and sorting uploads, limiting throughput
      during Jan–Apr peak.
    - >-
      20–35% of clients are still missing critical items by March 1, causing
      bottlenecks, extensions, and write-offs.
    - >-
      Manual checklists miss items tied to prior-year schedules (e.g., new K-1s,
      1099-Bs, 1095-A), leading to rework and increased error risk.
    - >-
      Clients upload documents via many channels (email, portals, text) causing
      misclassification, duplicate follow-ups, and security exposure.
    - >-
      Existing client portals/checklists are generic, require heavy staff setup,
      and don’t adapt dynamically to the client’s prior-year return.
    - >-
      Compliance pressure (FTC Safeguards Rule, GLBA) requires auditable, secure
      data handling—manual processes create gaps and audit risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      Parse prior-year returns (1040/1120/1065 plus schedules, K-1s, forms) to
      generate a personalized organizer and dynamic checklist per
      taxpayer/entity.
    - >-
      Orchestrate secure requests via client portal + email/SMS, with adaptive
      cadence based on response behavior.
    - >-
      Ingest and classify uploads from any channel (portal, email ingestion,
      mobile capture), auto-tagging to the correct taxpayer, tax year, and
      checklist item.
    - >-
      Detect missing or inconsistent items (e.g., W-2 count mismatch, 1099-B
      present last year but missing this year) and trigger targeted chasers.
    - >-
      Provide preparer dashboard showing client-by-client completeness score,
      blockers, and aging; escalate risks before deadlines.
    - >-
      Integrate with tax and practice tools (Intuit Lacerte/ProConnect,
      UltraTax, CCH Axcess, Drake, TaxDome, Canopy, SmartVault, DocuSign) to
      reduce swivel-chair work.
    - >-
      Maintain audit-ready logs, PII redaction options, role-based access,
      encryption, and security posture aligned to GLBA Safeguards and SOC 2.
  uniqueValueProp: >-

    checklist from last year’s return, automates secure client requests and
    reminders across email/SMS/portal, classifies uploads with >98% accuracy on

    50%+, reducing cycle time 30%, and improving on-time filing rates.
