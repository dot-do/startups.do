leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Retailers rely on generic batch-and-blast campaigns (typical CTR 1–2%,
      revenue per email <$0.05) that underperform versus personalized
      communications.
    - >-
      Merchandisers spend 10–30 hours/week manually curating email picks and
      homepage carousels; output is inconsistent and does not scale across
      categories, seasons, and geographies.
    - >-
      Catalog depth is under-monetized: <15% of titles get meaningful exposure;
      backlist discovery is weak despite high margins.
    - >-
      New release and pre-order relevance is missed; customers don’t get timely
      alerts for favorite authors/series, lowering LTV and repeat purchase
      rates.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (ESP, e-commerce, POS, onsite analytics) prevents
      effective segmentation and closed-loop attribution.
    - >-
      Cold-start items (new ISBNs, new articles) underperform due to lack of
      interaction history; generic engines struggle with book/news metadata
      complexity (editions, series, genres, imprints).
    - >-
      Onsite carousels often static or rule-based, leading to low widget CTR
      (<1.5%) and limited contribution to conversion.
    - >-
      Marketers lack trustworthy uplift measurement (incrementality, holdouts,
      A/B tests) and can’t quantify ROI of personalization investments.
    - >-
      Engineering bandwidth is scarce; integrating/maintaining generic
      personalization tools takes months and distracts core teams.
    - >-
      Privacy/regulatory risk (GDPR/CCPA) and deliverability (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
      concerns slow adoption of data-driven email personalization.
  solution:
    - >-
      One-day integration: import catalog via ONIX/CSV/API and drop a JS tag or
      server-side events for browse/add/purchase; OAuth to ESP (Klaviyo,
      Mailchimp, Braze, SFMC).
    - >-
      Auto-segmentation: weekly/daily cohorts built from behavior, author/series
      affinity, price sensitivity, format preference
      (hardcover/paperback/ebook/audio), and recency/frequency/monetary (RFM).
    - >-
      Content generation: AI assembles newsletter blocks (new releases, backlist
      you’ll love, series continuations, staff picks) and onsite carousels;
      human-editable with guardrails and redlines.
    - >-
      Hybrid recommendation engine: collaborative filtering + content embeddings
      tuned to book/news metadata (author, series, BISAC/IBIC, imprint, reviews,
      topic tags) for high precision and cold-start coverage.
    - >-
      Operational controls: frequency caps, category exclusions, safe lists,
      margin/availability rules, regional rights, and editorial pins for key
      titles.
    - >-
      Experimentation: auto A/B and multi-armed bandits on subject lines,
      layouts, and carousel ranking; holdout groups for incrementality.
    - >-
      Analytics: dashboard with CTR, CVR, RPM, RPE, AOV lift, LTV impact, and
      per-widget contribution; export to BI/CDP.
    - >-
      Compliance & deliverability: consent sync, GDPR/CCPA tooling, zero-PII
      model training, and DMARC-aligned sending when acting as ESP passthrough.
    - >-
      Time-to-value playbook: 30-day pilot with 3–5 use cases (new release
      alerts, favorites follow, backlist discovery, cart/browse recovery
      carousels).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Increase email revenue 20–50% and onsite conversion 5–15% in 30 days via
    plug-and-play, domain-specific recommendations for books and news. No
    replatforming: we auto-generate weekly emails and dynamic carousels using
    your catalog and customer behavior, with transparent uplift measurement and
    full ESP/e-commerce integration.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific recommendation stack and content graph purpose-built for
    books/news—handling editions, series continuity, rights/territories, and
    cold-start via ONIX-enriched metadata—combined with pre-built ESP/e-commerce
    connectors and playbooks that deliver measurable uplift in under 30 days.
    Over time, privacy-safe cross-client modeling (no raw PII sharing) improves
    cold-start and long-tail discovery beyond what generic engines or ESP-native
    suggestions can match.
