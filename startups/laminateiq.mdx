leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Unplanned off-spec events (thickness, haze, tensile) detected only after
      lab tests cause scrap/rework; typical scrap rates 2–6% of output, with
      single events costing $10k–$50k in material and downtime.
    - >-
      Late detection of drift during changeovers, resin lots, or ambient shifts
      leads to long stabilization times (30–90 minutes) and lost capacity.
    - >-
      Operators lack real-time guidance on which levers (screw speed, chill roll
      temp, line speed, nip pressure, die gap, resin mix) to adjust, leading to
      inconsistent actions and variation between shifts/plants.
    - >-
      SPC and online gauges monitor a few CTQs (e.g., thickness) but don’t
      predict multi-variable quality outcomes like haze, bond strength, or
      downstream forming performance.
    - >-
      Existing data is siloed (PLC/SCADA, historians, lab LIMS, MES).
      Integration and actionable analytics are scarce, limiting continuous
      improvement.
    - >-
      Customer audits (IATF 16949, ISO 9001) expect real-time controls,
      capability (Cpk > 1.33), and traceability; gaps drive containment costs
      and risk of chargebacks.
    - >-
      High expertise dependence (one or two process gurus); knowledge not
      codified, creating vulnerability during turnover.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to PLC/SCADA/historians (OPC UA, Modbus, MQTT, AVEVA PI) and
      LIMS/MES to unify process, inline, and lab data with full lot genealogy.
    - >-
      Build multivariate soft-sensor models linking critical inputs
      (temperatures, pressures, screw speed, die gap, nip force, line speed,
      resin lots, ambient) to CTQs (thickness profile, haze, tensile, bond
      strength).
    - >-
      Real-time scoring at the edge or cloud with 1–5 second cadence; early
      warnings when predicted probability of OOS exceeds threshold (e.g., >60%).
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance: ranked setpoint adjustments (e.g., −3% line speed,
      +2°C chill roll 1, +0.1 mm die lip) with expected quality impact and
      confidence intervals.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox for process engineers to simulate recipes and
      environmental changes before production.
    - >-
      Automated model retraining and drift monitoring; A/B tests to validate
      improvements; full audit trail for IATF/ISO audits.
    - >-
      Dashboards: shift-level performance, OEE-quality view, capability
      (Cpk/Ppk), false alert tracking, and cost savings attribution.
    - >-
      Deployment playbook: 8–12 week pilot on 1–2 lines, targeting one primary
      CTQ (e.g., haze) and one secondary (e.g., tensile) to prove ROI; then
      scale plant-wide.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce scrap and prevent off-spec before it happens. LaminateIQ predicts OOS
    for thickness, haze, tensile, and bond strength 5–30 minutes ahead, then
    recommends precise setpoint changes to keep runs within spec—cutting scrap
    20–40%, shortening changeovers by 15–30%, and raising Cpk to meet customer
    audits.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Pre-built, validated soft sensors and prescriptive models for haze, tensile,
    and bond strength in laminated plastics; an integrations and recipe-aware
    modeling library tuned for extrusion/lamination; and proprietary datasets
    and playbooks that shorten pilots to 8–12 weeks and deliver measurable
    savings with high operator adoption.

  character: >-
    Ops, Quality, and Process leaders at laminated plastics plate, sheet (except
    packaging), and shape manufacturers who need every run on spec, less scrap,
    and reliable delivery.
  problem: >-
    External: Process drift and raw-material variability push thickness, haze,
    and tensile out of spec; lab delays catch issues late; scrap and downtime
    rise.

    Internal: Teams are stuck firefighting and feel blind to the next deviation.

    Philosophical: Preventable defects shouldn’t reach a winder—or a customer.
  guide: >-
    We’re plastics process engineers and applied-ML specialists who’ve delivered
    predictive quality and early-warning alerts on extrusion and lamination
    lines. We integrate with PLC/SCADA, historians, and LIMS, and make model
    drivers transparent so operators trust the guidance.
  plan: >-
    1) Define CTQs (thickness, haze, tensile) and ROI targets.

    2) Connect line, historian, and LIMS data; build a clean digital thread.

    3) Train/validate models linking process variables to quality; tune alert
    thresholds.

    4) Pilot on one line with early-warning and prescriptive corrective actions.

    5) Scale across lines; train users; monitor and improve.

    Assurances: You own your data; secure by design; no control-logic changes;
    clear success criteria for pilot exit.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute discovery; Start a 6‑week pilot on one line.

    Transitional: Download the readiness checklist; Request sample alerts and
    reports; Get an ROI estimate.
  success: >-
    Fewer OOS events and less scrap; higher first-pass yield and throughput;
    stable runs with faster changeovers; empowered operators with explainable
    guidance; audit-ready traceability; happier customers and better margins.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing firefighting, unplanned downtime, and wasted resin/energy; late lab
    catches and customer complaints; price concessions and missed deliveries;
    lost capacity and certification risk.

  problem:
    - >-
      Quality drift is found in the lab, not on the line, driving scrap and
      rework.
    - SPC lags while multilayer interactions hide root causes.
    - >-
      Operators juggle many knobs (die gap, nip pressure, chill roll temp, line
      speed) without clear guidance.
    - >-
      Customer specs keep tightening; audits demand traceability by coil, sheet,
      and run.
    - >-
      Chasing defects triggers unplanned downtime and shift-to-shift
      variability.
    - 'Data is siloed across PLC/SCADA, MES, and LIMS with no unified view.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Real-time models predict OOS risk for thickness, haze, and tensile minutes
      to hours ahead.
    - Prescriptive actions tell operators what to change and by how much.
    - >-
      Early-warning alerts in the control room, mobile, and email for fast
      response.
