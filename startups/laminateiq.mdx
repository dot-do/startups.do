leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual rule-checking for ISO 12215-5/ABS is slow (1–3 weeks per new
      hull/deck/stiffener set) and error-prone due to spreadsheets and
      fragmented workflows.
    - >-
      Weight and cost penalties from conservative layups are common; typical
      overdesign margins (safety factors >2.0 where 1.1–1.3 would suffice) add
      3–12% weight and 5–15% material cost.
    - >-
      Keeping up with evolving rules (e.g., ISO 12215-5 revisions, ABS updates)
      is difficult; version drift leads to rework and approval delays.
    - >-
      Lack of traceability: plan-approval reviewers ask for clause-by-clause
      evidence; generating audit-ready documentation can take 20–40 hours per
      project.
    - >-
      Poor handoff between design, engineering, and production: laminate
      definitions in CAD/PLM don’t match shop-floor ply books and take-offs,
      causing scrap (1–5%) and build errors.
    - >-
      Material allowables and partial safety factors are inconsistently applied
      across projects; “tribal knowledge” risk when senior engineers leave.
    - >-
      Late-design changes trigger full recalcs across zones; existing tools lack
      fast re-optimization and impact assessment.
    - >-
      Small and mid-size builders lack access to high-end composite solvers or
      internal specialists; they need a guided, standards-focused solution.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-assisted rule engine codifying ISO 12215-5 and applicable ABS rules
      with clause-level traceability and version pinning per project.
    - >-
      Discrete laminate optimizer balancing safety factors, weight, and cost
      subject to manufacturing constraints (symmetry, balance, minimum drop,
      orientation percentages, ply continuity).
    - >-
      Material library with vendor-verified allowables (cores, UD, biax, triax,
      woven fabrics, resin systems) and temperature/moisture knockdowns.
    - >-
      CAD/PLM integrations (Rhino/Orca3D, SolidWorks, Siemens Fibersim, CATIA
      Composites, ANSYS ACP) for zone import/export and automatic ply book
      generation.
    - >-
      Automatic take-offs (area by ply/orientation/kit), nesting-ready CSV/DXF
      exports for cutting tables (Gerber/Lectra/Eastman).
    - >-
      Plan-approval “audit pack” generator: inputs, assumptions, partial
      factors, governing clauses, load cases, results, sensitivity and margin
      summaries.
    - >-
      Scenario and change-impact analysis with delta reports for late-stage
      design changes.
    - >-
      REST API for embedding in OEM workflows and for batch verification across
      variants/series.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From CAD to class-ready laminate in hours, not weeks. Automatically verify
    against ISO 12215-5/ABS, optimize for weight and cost, and generate
    audit-ready reports, ply books, and take-offs. Typical outcomes: 30–70% time
    saved on checks, 5–12% weight reduction, 3–10% material savings,
    zero-ambiguity plan-approval packs.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Clause-verified digital rule packs with audit-ready evidence, co-developed
    interpretations with plan-approval engineers, and a vendor-verified
    materials library create trust and speed approvals. The optimizer learns
    from anonymized design patterns and approval outcomes, improving default
    stacks and constraints over time. Deep CAD/PLM and nesting integrations
    close the loop from design to shop floor, which generic composites tools
    lack.
