leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Energy-intensive furnace cycles (graphitization/baking) have 10–30% hidden
      safety margins that inflate energy use and cycle time.
    - >-
      Volatile power/natural gas prices and demand charges make fixed recipes
      economically suboptimal.
    - >-
      Quality risks (cracks, warpage, resistivity out-of-spec, porosity) force
      conservative soak times and ramp rates; limited ability to quantify risk
      tradeoffs.
    - >-
      Operator variability and tribal knowledge lead to inconsistent profiles
      across shifts, furnaces, and product mixes.
    - >-
      Lack of integrated optimization across scheduling, loading patterns, and
      cycle control (open-loop setpoints vs. closed-loop optimization).
    - >-
      Fragmented data (SCADA/PLC historians, lab QA, MES, energy meters)
      prevents end-to-end learning of quality-energy-time tradeoffs.
    - >-
      ESG and carbon intensity reduction targets require measurable, auditable
      improvements without capex-heavy furnace replacement.
  solution:
    - >-
      Physics-informed ML that predicts quality (e.g., resistivity, bulk
      density, strength, porosity) from cycle parameters, load patterns, and
      product attributes, with guardrails for thermal stress and safety limits.
    - >-
      Cycle optimizer that proposes shorter/cheaper profiles (ramp, soak, max
      temperature, current schedules) respecting constraints (material, furnace,
      emissions, power contracts).
    - >-
      Batch loading and packing optimizer (coke/graphite bed, spacing,
      clamp/connection plan, product mix) to improve uniformity and reduce
      hot/cold spots.
    - >-
      Real-time advisory or closed-loop setpoint adjustments via PLC/SCADA
      (model predictive control optional) to follow optimal temperature/current
      trajectories.
    - >-
      Energy market and tariff optimizer to shift high-load segments away from
      peaks; demand-charge and curtailment participation with automated
      scheduling recommendations.
    - >-
      Digital twin and what-if simulator to evaluate recipe changes before live
      runs; A/B testing with statistical confidence tracking.
    - >-
      Automated compliance and ESG reporting: kWh/ton, MJ/ton, CO2/ton,
      cycle-time distributions, yield, and traceable audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce furnace cycle time 10–20% and energy 8–15% with zero quality loss,
    guaranteed—or we don’t charge. Physics-informed AI learns your
    product-specific tradeoffs and proposes certified-safe, auditable cycle
    changes. Deploys on existing furnaces (Acheson/LWG/ABF) in 8–12 weeks, with
    pay-for-performance pricing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross-plant, graphite-specific dataset and physics-constrained
    optimization library that captures product-, furnace-, and pack-dependent
    behavior. Proven, auditable safety envelopes and OEM-reviewed constraints
    enable faster approvals than generic APC/AI. Outcome-based pricing with case
    studies in electrodes, ABF, and anodes builds trust and speeds adoption.

    who want higher throughput and lower energy costs without risking spec
    compliance or delivery.
  problem: >-
    - External: Long, energy-heavy baking/graphitization cycles are conservative
    bottlenecks; recipe variability and limited visibility make change risky.

    - Internal: Pressure to hit cost and OTIF targets with zero defects; fear
    that tweaks will create scrap or rework.

    - Philosophical: Wasting megawatt-hours and days is wrong when data can
    deliver the same quality faster and safer.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know altering furnace recipes is high-stakes—one bad run can
    cost weeks, reputation, and customers.

    - Authority: A team combining furnace science and applied AI; we learn from
    your historical runs, validate with rigorous back-testing/simulation, and
    document results with auditable methods.
