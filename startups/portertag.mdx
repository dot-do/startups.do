  problem:
    - >-
      Supplier-provided assets (images, PDFs, spreadsheets) are incomplete or
      inconsistent, forcing 10–25 minutes of manual tagging and copywriting per
      SKU.
    - >-
      Critical attributes for luggage/leather goods (dimensions, capacity,
      compartments, materials, hardware finish, warranty, airline cabin
      compliance) are often missing, inaccurate, or unstandardized, causing
      returns and low conversion.
    - >-
      SEO content is duplicated across retailers or non-optimized; PDPs
      underperform on long-tail queries (e.g., “polycarbonate 24-inch spinner
      with TSA lock”).
    - >-
      Retailers struggle to map supplier taxonomies to internal PIM schemas and
      marketplace requirements (GS1/Google Merchant/Amazon), creating delays and
      data debt.
    - >-
      Scaling multilingual catalogs (EN/FR/DE/ES/IT/JP/CN) is costly and slow,
      with inconsistent tone and brand compliance.
    - >-
      Quality control and auditability are weak; teams lack confidence scores,
      change history, and validation rules to manage risk and comply with claims
      regulations.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest supplier assets (images, PDFs, spec sheets, GS1 feeds) via API,
      SFTP, or PIM/DAM connectors.
    - >-
      Use vision-language models and OCR to detect attributes: dimensions
      (H/W/D), capacity (L), shell type, materials, lining, compartments,
      wheels, handle type, locks (TSA), strap type, hardware finish, RFID
      blocking, warranty, origin, sustainability claims.
    - >-
      Normalize and map extracted data to retailer schemas and channel templates
      (Google Merchant, Amazon, Zalando).
    - >-
      Generate structured bullets, care notes, and SEO-friendly titles/meta/long
      descriptions with guardrails and brand tone presets; multilingual output
      supported.
    - >-
      Automated validation rules and confidence scoring; route low-confidence
      fields to a review UI for human approval.
    - >-
      Variant detection and deduplication; identify color/material/style
      variants and group into families.
    - >-
      Sync approved data back to PIM/ecommerce (Salsify, Akeneo, Shopify Plus,
      Magento, Salesforce Commerce Cloud) with versioning and audit logs.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard to track attribute coverage, time-to-publish,
      conversion impact, and SEO performance; A/B test copy variants.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn supplier assets into publish-ready PDPs in minutes. PorterTag AI
    extracts precise luggage/leather attributes, generates care notes and SEO
    copy, maps to your taxonomy, and syncs to your PIM—backed by confidence
    scoring, human-in-the-loop QA, and >95% accuracy on critical fields.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Category-specialized models and ontology for luggage/leather goods deliver
    higher attribute accuracy than generic AI. Deep PIM connectors and
    validation rules (dimensions/capacity/airline thresholds, materials
    taxonomy, claims guardrails) reduce manual effort and risk. Active learning
    fueled by customer edits creates a proprietary dataset and increasing
    accuracy moat; auditability and confidence scoring enable enterprise trust
    and approvals at scale.

    Ecommerce and merchandising leaders at luggage and leather goods retailers
    who want richer PDPs, faster launches, and consistent data without manual
    tagging.

    lift, secure pipelines, and integrations with PIM/ERP/ecommerce platforms.
