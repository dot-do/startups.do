  problem:
    - >-
      Scheduling across time zones and organizations causes 4–7 back-and-forth
      emails per meeting and 7–12 minutes of admin time, creating hidden labor
      costs of 3–5 hours per employee per month.
    - >-
      Coordinating multi-party meetings (3+ attendees) increases failure rates:
      30–40 percent of first proposals fall through; rescheduling adds another
      2–3 emails on average.
    - >-
      Existing tools are link-centric and single-purpose; they don’t negotiate
      within email threads, respect complex preferences, or apply org policies
      reliably.
    - >-
      Manual scheduling leads to revenue leakage: slow booking cycles increase
      no-show rates and opportunity drop-off in sales and recruiting funnels.
    - >-
      Ops and support teams lack auditability and SLA controls for scheduling
      activities performed by human assistants or ad hoc processes.
    - >-
      Global teams struggle with holiday calendars, daylight savings, and
      meeting buffers, causing double-bookings and late-night meetings that hurt
      employee satisfaction.
  solution:
    - >-
      An AI coordination agent connected to calendars, email, conferencing, and
      CRMs that reads context, proposes options, negotiates availability, books
      meetings, and handles reschedules and follow-ups autonomously.
    - >-
      Policy engine encodes org and user preferences (working hours, buffers,
      travel time, round-robin rules, VIP handling, compliance constraints).
    - >-
      Multi-party coordination that escalates to polls when needed, holds
      tentative slots, and cleans up holds automatically.
    - >-
      Integrated reminders and confirmation flows to reduce no-shows; detects
      OOO and auto-offers alternatives.
    - >-
      Admin console with audit logs, SLAs, approval workflows, and privacy
      controls for operations and compliance teams.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Autonomous, policy-aware scheduling that books and reschedules meetings
    across organizations and time zones directly in your email threads—cutting
    back-and-forth by 70–90 percent and booking in under 6 hours on median, with
    enterprise-grade controls.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A policy-aware scheduling graph that learns organization-level and
    individual preferences over time across thousands of interactions, combined
    with deep Microsoft/Google integrations and enterprise compliance. This
    yields higher auto-schedule rates and fewer errors than link-based tools or
    generic LLM email bots. Accumulated preference and negotiation data
    (privacy-preserving) create a moat that’s hard to replicate.
