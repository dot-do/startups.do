  problem:
    - >-
      Exploration teams waste budget drilling low-probability targets due to
      incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated geoscience data integration
      (satellite, DEM, structural, occurrences).
    - >-
      Time-to-first-target is long (6–18 months) because target generation
      workflows are manual and siloed across GIS, geology, and data science
      teams.
    - >-
      Remote, underexplored terrains lack dense geochemical or geophysical
      coverage, increasing uncertainty and risk in prioritizing areas for
      follow-up.
    - >-
      Existing prospectivity models are opaque (black box), hard to validate,
      and rarely quantify uncertainty or transfer well across geological
      terranes.
    - >-
      High-resolution data procurement and pre-processing (cloud masking,
      terrain correction, lineament extraction) are costly and technically
      difficult for in-house teams.
    - >-
      Exploration leaders need defensible, auditable reasoning to justify spend
      to boards and investors; current maps don’t provide reproducible metrics
      and success probabilities.
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse multispectral (Sentinel-2/Landsat/ASTER), SAR (Sentinel-1), DEM
      (SRTM/ALOS), and known occurrences to generate 10–30 m resolution
      prospectivity maps for specific deposit models (e.g., Ni-Cu sulfide, IOCG,
      porphyry Cu-Mo, REE).
    - >-
      Automated structural geology: DEM/SAR-derived lineaments, fault/fracture
      density, intersection nodes, and dilation zones to highlight structural
      traps.
    - >-
      Alteration mapping: spectral indices (e.g., clay, iron oxides, carbonates,
      propylitic/argillic) and thermal anomalies to infer hydrothermal
      footprints.
    - >-
      Probabilistic ranking of targets with uncertainty bounds, accessible in a
      web portal and as GIS-ready layers (GeoTIFF/GeoPackage).
    - >-
      Terrane-aware transfer learning: models calibrated on analogous belts and
      validated with hold-out regions to avoid overfitting.
    - >-
      Action plans: fieldwork prioritization pack (target rationale,
      access/permit overlays, suggested sampling/traverses) and ROI calculator
      for program planning.
    - >-
      Integrations: ArcGIS Pro/QGIS plugin, Leapfrog/Seequent import, API for
      automated portfolio screening.
    - >-
      Optionally augment with commercial high-res data (Planet, Airbus;
      PRISMA/EnMAP hyperspectral where available) and client geophysics/geochem
      for premium tiers.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce time-to-first-target and increase discovery hit-rate by delivering
    auditable, multi-sensor AI prospectivity maps with quantified uncertainty
    and ranked drill-ready targets—cutting targeting cycles from months to weeks
    and lowering cost per discovery.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, continuously expanding global occurrences-structural-alteration
    dataset and terrane-aware ML pipelines that produce auditable,
    uncertainty-aware prospectivity maps—validated by independent
    consultants—with optional success-based royalty alignment that incumbents
    rarely offer.

  character: >-
    Exploration managers and chief geologists at other metal ore mining
    companies who must deliver high‑quality drill targets while controlling
    risk, cost, and timelines.
  problem: >-
    External: Disparate datasets and slow fieldwork make target definition
    uncertain and expensive. Internal: Teams are under pressure to hit discovery
    milestones with limited staff and budget. Philosophical: You shouldn’t have
    to gamble millions on guesswork when the data already contains the signal.
  guide: >-
    Satellite‑Driven Exploration Targeting is your AI geoscience partner. We
    understand the pressure to justify every drilling dollar. We combine
    multi‑sensor satellite imagery, DEM‑derived lineaments, and known
    occurrences with structural context to rank probable mineralization zones,
    using transparent, reproducible workflows that integrate with your GIS.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Scope and data audit; 2) District‑scale AI fusion and
    prospectivity modeling; 3) Deliver and integrate a ranked target map with
    confidence scores and a field‑validation roadmap; 4) Iterate with your team
    to finalize drill‑ready targets. Agreement: NDA and data security by
    default, clear KPIs (hit‑rate uplift, cost per target, cycle time), and a
    low‑risk pilot option.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a 30‑minute scoping call to start a pilot in your priority
    district. Transitional: Request a sample prospectivity map and methods brief
    for your region.
  success: >-
    A faster, data‑driven target pipeline; higher discovery probability and
    fewer dry holes; reduced reconnaissance footprint; clearer investment
    narrative and permitting support; teams focused on the best ground first.
  failure: >-
    Continued budget burn on blind grids and step‑outs, delayed programs,
    unnecessary disturbance, missed discovery windows, and competitors securing
    the best ground first.
