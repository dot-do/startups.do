  problem:
    - >-
      Retail paint/wallpaper stores and their pro desks spend 20–60 minutes
      manually building quotes for contractors/designers, leading to bottlenecks
      and inconsistent pricing.
    - >-
      Materials coverage (paint, primer, wallpaper rolls, adhesives) is
      estimated inconsistently; over/under-buy drives returns, wasted trips, and
      margin loss.
    - >-
      Contractors often use generic estimating tools that don’t map to retailer
      SKUs, color lines, or inventory, causing low conversion from quote to
      in-store order.
    - >-
      Scheduling and labor are poorly estimated (productivity rates, coat
      counts, prep time), creating callbacks, change orders, and customer
      dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Wallpaper estimating is error-prone (pattern repeat, match type, waste
      factors), causing costly reorders and project delays.
    - >-
      Retailers lack visibility into quote performance (conversion, AOV uplift,
      return rate) and can’t systematically improve pro customer loyalty.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI quote builder that converts scope inputs (room dimensions, photos,
      plans, notes) into itemized materials, labor hours, and a proposed
      schedule.
    - >-
      SKU-aware engine: maps finishes, sheens, bases, can sizes, adhesives,
      primers, sundries, and wallpaper rolls to retailer catalogs and current
      inventory.
    - >-
      Coverage intelligence: brand- and product-specific coverage,
      substrate/prep factors, number of coats, and regional VOC rules baked in.
    - >-
      Wallpaper estimator: pattern repeat/match, roll type (single/double/Euro),
      waste and cuts; recommends exact roll count and adhesives.
    - >-
      Labor model: localized productivity rates per task (prep, masking,
      cutting, rolling, hang time), crew sizing, and schedule generation.
    - >-
      Quote-to-order: one-click draft order creation in POS; split by
      pickup/delivery; deposit options; e-sign and payment link.
    - >-
      Change-order management: versioned quotes, delta calculation, and
      re-scheduling; tracks margin impact.
    - >-
      Analytics for retailers: quote volume, conversion to order, AOV uplift,
      returns %, SKU attach rates, and pro retention.
    - >-
      Integrations: POS/ERP (Epicor Eagle, ECI Spruce/RockSolid, Lightspeed),
      inventory, payments (Stripe), accounting for contractors (QuickBooks).
    - Mobile/web app + in-store kiosk mode with store branding.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn any scope (text, photos, floor plans) into an accurate, branded quote
    in under 5 minutes—complete with SKU-level materials, labor, schedule, and a
    draft order ready for pickup or delivery—driving higher conversion, fewer
    returns, and happier pros.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Retailer-anchored, SKU- and brand-specific coverage intelligence plus POS
    inventory/order integrations create a data moat. Continuous feedback loop
    from quotes-to-orders-to-returns refines waste and coverage models
    store-by-store, improving accuracy and locking in workflows competitors
    without retailer integrations can’t match.
