      exceptions

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      High administrative burden: Movers and TPAs spend 30–60 minutes per claim
      collecting info, validating documents, and preparing settlement offers.
    - >-
      Inconsistent triage and valuation mapping: Adjusters interpret coverage
      (Released Value vs Full Value Protection) differently, causing leakage and
      disputes.
    - >-
      Slow cycle times: Average FNOL-to-offer is 10–21 days, damaging CX and NPS
      and increasing escalation rates.
    - >-
      Regulatory risk: Complex and inconsistent adherence to FMCSA (e.g., 49 CFR
      370) and state timelines creates compliance exposure.
    - >-
      Data fragmentation: Photos, inventories, BOLs, and valuation agreements
      live in different systems; evidence packages are incomplete or hard to
      audit.
    - >-
      Lack of transparency for claimants: Poor guidance leads to incomplete
      submissions and back-and-forth, raising abandonment and complaint rates.
  solution:
    - >-
      Guided claimant portal that pre-fills shipment data (from inventory/BOL)
      and enforces photo/evidence completeness upfront.
    - >-
      AI damage classifier (image + text) that labels item, damage type,
      severity, and cause; flags pre-existing damage indicators where inventory
      notations exist.
    - >-
      Valuation coverage engine that maps each line item to applicable coverage
      (Released Value at $0.60/lb per article vs FVP terms) and computes
      repair/replace/cash options.
    - >-
      Settlement calculator with configurable rules (depreciation curves where
      applicable, FVP repair/replace logic without depreciation, salvage rules,
      pair-and-set handling).
    - >-
      Document extraction and matching (BOL, inventory, valuation election,
      delivery receipts, repair estimates) via OCR; confidence scoring;
      human-in-the-loop exceptions.
    - >-
      Automated settlement packet drafting: cover letter, claim summary,
      evidence index, calculation details, recommended offer(s), and compliance
      timeline status.
    - >-
      Compliance workflow aligned to FMCSA 49 CFR 370 and internal SLAs:
      acknowledgment, request-for-info reminders, decision deadlines, and audit
      logs.
    - >-
      Negotiation assist: templated responses, revised offers, and clear
      reasoning to reduce escalations and chargebacks.
    - >-
      Integrations with move/claims platforms (e.g., Supermove, SmartMoving,
      Movegistics) and e-sign/payment for releases.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: cycle time, severity variance, exception rates,
      adjuster touches, claimant CSAT, and regulator-ready audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Settle claims faster, fairer, and fully compliant. Guided submissions, AI
    damage classification, automatic valuation coverage mapping, and one-click
    settlement packet drafting reduce cycle times by 50–70% and claim severity
    by 8–15%, while improving claimant transparency and regulatory adherence.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A proprietary HHG-specific valuation and rules engine combined with trained
    image/text models on mover claim datasets and deep integrations with move
    management platforms. This creates switching costs, explainable decisions,
    and regulator-ready audit trails that generic claims AI cannot match.
