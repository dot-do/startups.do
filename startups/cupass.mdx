  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent wire/tube breaks during rolling and drawing (typical 3–10 breaks
      per million meters) causing unplanned downtime and scrap.
    - >-
      Energy intensity and peak demand charges are high (kWh/ton often 5–15%
      above best-in-class) due to suboptimal speed/temperature profiles.
    - >-
      Die wear and premature failures (10–30% variability in pulls per die)
      raise consumable costs and force schedule disruptions.
    - >-
      Dimensional and property variability (Cpk < 1.33 on critical
      diameters/hardness) leads to rework, downgraded product, and customer
      complaints.
    - >-
      Process expertise is tribal; shift-to-shift variation and operator
      turnover cause inconsistent outcomes.
    - >-
      Existing PLC/MES/Level-2 controls lack multi-objective optimization; OEM
      solutions are inflexible or expensive to customize across alloys and
      product mixes.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs, SCADA, historians, LIMS; limited
      contextualization prevents rapid root-cause analysis and closed-loop
      improvements.
    - >-
      Changeovers between diameters/alloys incur lengthy tuning (30–120 minutes)
      and elevated scrap until stable conditions are reached.
    - >-
      Limited predictive capability for microstructure/properties (grain size,
      hardness, conductivity) drives conservative, inefficient schedules.
    - >-
      Risk of quality escapes and lack of traceability increase cost of quality
      and customer audit burden.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML digital twin of copper rolling/drawing/extrusion
      predicting elongation, load, tension, temperature, microstructure,
      hardness, and dimensional outcomes per pass.
    - >-
      Real-time pass schedule and speed profile recommendations that honor
      torque/tension/power constraints and thermal limits while meeting final
      specs.
    - >-
      Temperature window optimization (preheat/interpass) to control work
      hardening and recrystallization, improving property consistency and die
      life.
    - >-
      Break risk predictor using tension, torque, vibration, and temperature
      signatures; proactive speed derates and lubricant/temperature
      recommendations to avoid breaks.
    - >-
      Die wear model estimating pulls-per-die and optimal changeout timing;
      recommends die sequence, lubrication, and polishing cycles to extend life
      10–25%.
    - >-
      Energy optimizer to reduce kWh/ton and peak demand charges via
      speed/temperature coordination and demand-aware scheduling.
    - >-
      Advisory and closed-loop modes: start with operator-approved
      recommendations; optional closed-loop control with certified guardrails
      and safety interlocks.
    - >-
      Simulation sandbox for engineers to test schedules offline across
      alloys/diameters; A/B testing and safe rollout management.
    - >-
      Automated quality and traceability reports linking pass schedules, process
      conditions, and test results for audits and customer reporting.
    - >-
      Edge gateway + cloud architecture integrating with OPC UA/Modbus/Siemens
      S7/Rockwell; low-latency inference at the edge and fleet learning in the
      cloud.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI that jointly optimizes pass schedules, speeds, and temperature windows to
    hit final dimensions and properties with fewer breaks, lower energy, and
    longer die life—deployable in weeks, integrating with existing PLC/MES, and
    proven to deliver measurable ROI within a quarter.
  unfairAdvantage: >-

  character: >-
    Operations and process leaders in copper rolling, drawing, extruding, and
    alloying (NAICS 331420) who must hit spec every run while boosting
    throughput and asset life.
  problem: >-
    External: frequent breaks, variable properties, high power use, die/roll
    wear, and complex pass scheduling. Internal: pressure to raise OEE, cut
    scrap, and meet dates with limited expert bandwidth. Philosophical: copper
    transformation should be predictable and data‑driven—not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of an unexpected break and the stress of
    trial‑and‑error setups. Our metallurgists and ML engineers built the Pass
    Schedule & Speed Optimizer—an AI agent that recommends pass schedules,
    speeds, and temperature windows tailored to your mill, alloys, and controls.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess and connect data (Level 2/SCADA/MES, lab, historian). 2) Calibrate
    models on historical runs and standards. 3) Deploy guarded recommendations
    via HMI/API with operator acceptance. 4) Review weekly, learn continuously,
    and scale line‑by‑line with clear success criteria and data security.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a discovery call and pilot. Transitional: Request a no‑cost
    opportunity assessment using recent runs.
  success: >-
    Consistent final dimensions/properties, fewer breaks, lower power draw,
    longer die/roll life, faster setups, higher OEE, captured know‑how,
    predictable delivery, and a safer, calmer mill.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing breaks and scrap, energy waste, premature die/roll wear, missed
    specs and rush rework, lost throughput, firefighting schedules, and reliance
    on fragile tribal knowledge.
