  problem:
    - >-
      Frequent wire/tube breaks during rolling and drawing (typical 3–10 breaks
      per million meters) causing unplanned downtime and scrap.
    - >-
      Energy intensity and peak demand charges are high (kWh/ton often 5–15%
      above best-in-class) due to suboptimal speed/temperature profiles.
    - >-
      Die wear and premature failures (10–30% variability in pulls per die)
      raise consumable costs and force schedule disruptions.
    - >-
      Dimensional and property variability (Cpk < 1.33 on critical
      diameters/hardness) leads to rework, downgraded product, and customer
      complaints.
    - >-
      Process expertise is tribal; shift-to-shift variation and operator
      turnover cause inconsistent outcomes.
    - >-
      Existing PLC/MES/Level-2 controls lack multi-objective optimization; OEM
      solutions are inflexible or expensive to customize across alloys and
      product mixes.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLCs, SCADA, historians, LIMS; limited
      contextualization prevents rapid root-cause analysis and closed-loop
      improvements.
    - >-
      Changeovers between diameters/alloys incur lengthy tuning (30–120 minutes)
      and elevated scrap until stable conditions are reached.
    - >-
      Limited predictive capability for microstructure/properties (grain size,
      hardness, conductivity) drives conservative, inefficient schedules.
    - >-
      Risk of quality escapes and lack of traceability increase cost of quality
      and customer audit burden.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid physics + ML digital twin of copper rolling/drawing/extrusion
      predicting elongation, load, tension, temperature, microstructure,
      hardness, and dimensional outcomes per pass.
    - >-
      Real-time pass schedule and speed profile recommendations that honor
      torque/tension/power constraints and thermal limits while meeting final
      specs.
    - >-
      Temperature window optimization (preheat/interpass) to control work
      hardening and recrystallization, improving property consistency and die
      life.
    - >-
      Break risk predictor using tension, torque, vibration, and temperature
      signatures; proactive speed derates and lubricant/temperature
      recommendations to avoid breaks.
    - >-
      Die wear model estimating pulls-per-die and optimal changeout timing;
      recommends die sequence, lubrication, and polishing cycles to extend life
      10–25%.
    - >-
      Energy optimizer to reduce kWh/ton and peak demand charges via
      speed/temperature coordination and demand-aware scheduling.

      Advisory and closed-loop modes: start with operator-approved
      recommendations; optional closed-loop control with certified guardrails
      and safety interlocks.
    - >-
      Simulation sandbox for engineers to test schedules offline across
      alloys/diameters; A/B testing and safe rollout management.

      conditions, and test results for audits and customer reporting.
    - >-
      Edge gateway + cloud architecture integrating with OPC UA/Modbus/Siemens
      S7/Rockwell; low-latency inference at the edge and fleet learning in the
      cloud.

    Operations and process leaders in copper rolling, drawing, extruding, and
    alloying (NAICS 331420) who must hit spec every run while boosting
    throughput and asset life.
  problem: >-
    External: frequent breaks, variable properties, high power use, die/roll
    wear, and complex pass scheduling. Internal: pressure to raise OEE, cut
    scrap, and meet dates with limited expert bandwidth. Philosophical: copper
    transformation should be predictable and data‑driven—not guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the cost of an unexpected break and the stress of
    trial‑and‑error setups. Our metallurgists and ML engineers built the Pass
    Schedule & Speed Optimizer—an AI agent that recommends pass schedules,
    speeds, and temperature windows tailored to your mill, alloys, and controls.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess and connect data (Level 2/SCADA/MES, lab, historian). 2) Calibrate
    models on historical runs and standards. 3) Deploy guarded recommendations
    via HMI/API with operator acceptance. 4) Review weekly, learn continuously,
    and scale line‑by‑line with clear success criteria and data security.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Schedule a discovery call and pilot. Transitional: Request a no‑cost
    opportunity assessment using recent runs.
  success: >-
    Consistent final dimensions/properties, fewer breaks, lower power draw,
    longer die/roll life, faster setups, higher OEE, captured know‑how,
    predictable delivery, and a safer, calmer mill.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing breaks and scrap, energy waste, premature die/roll wear, missed
    specs and rush rework, lost throughput, firefighting schedules, and reliance
    on fragile tribal knowledge.
