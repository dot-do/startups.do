  problem:
    - >-
      Synthetic rubber plants run dryers, steam headers, and chillers
      conservatively to avoid off-spec moisture/temperature, wasting 8–20% of
      energy per ton.
    - >-
      Steam header imbalances (PRV throttling, poor boiler loading, condensate
      return losses) raise fuel cost and variability; operators lack visibility
      and optimization tools.
    - >-
      Dryer outlet moisture control is noisy and lagging; limited inline sensors
      force setpoints well above required temperature/humidity, increasing
      energy use and off-spec risk.
    - >-
      Chillers often overcool to maintain margins; condenser fouling, suboptimal
      sequencing, and poor setpoint coordination increase kW/ton.
    - >-
      Existing APC/MPC projects are expensive, brittle across products, and not
      tailored for batch-to-batch variability in SR grades; operator trust and
      adoption are low.
    - >-
      Energy and emissions targets (corporate and regulatory) demand measurable
      reduction with verification without compromising throughput or quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      Edge-deployed optimization copilot that connects via OPC UA/Modbus/PI to
      DCS/SCADA; runs in recommendation mode or closed-loop with operator
      approval.
    - >-
      Physics + ML hybrid models: moisture soft sensor for dryer outlet; steam
      header network model; chiller plant model (sequencing + setpoints).
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer (cost, energy, emissions) with hard
      safety/quality constraints and operator-configurable guardrails.
    - >-
      Boiler/steam: load allocation across boilers, header pressure targeting,
      PRV loss minimization, condensate return optimization.
    - >-
      Dryers: feed-forward control using upstream moisture/throughput/grade;
      zone temperature/airflow/humidity setpoint optimization to hit moisture
      spec with minimum energy.
    - >-
      Chillers: condenser approach optimization, chilled-water and
      condenser-water setpoints, pump/VFD logic and sequencing based on
      real-time load and weather.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: simulate recipes, ambient conditions, and schedules;
      quantify expected savings and quality risk before deploying.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: baselines, savings, and tCO2e reduction with IPMVP
      Option B; utility-incentive-ready reports.
    - >-
      Operator UX: clear suggestions, confidence bands, and reason codes;
      override tracking to build trust and continuous learning.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
