leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Ferry and passenger vessel ETAs are often inaccurate (5–15+ minute errors)
      due to currents, wind, tide, congestion, and manual updates, causing
      missed connections and passenger dissatisfaction.
    - >-
      Berth/ramp conflicts at busy terminals lead to cascading delays, idling
      vessels, and unsafe close-quarters waiting, often resolved via last-minute
      radio coordination.
    - >-
      Terminal assets (ramps, berths) have uneven utilization; peak-hour
      bunching coexists with idle capacity due to lack of predictive scheduling
      tools.
    - >-
      Dispatchers lack a real-time, systemwide view to proactively resequence
      arrivals and minimize conflicts while respecting safety, crew rules, and
      tide/air-draft constraints.
    - >-
      Existing AIS/traffic tools visualize positions but do not optimize
      passenger-dedicated operations or dock allocation, leaving ROI on the
      table (fuel, crew overtime, OTP penalties).
  solution:
    - >-
      Fuse AIS Class A data with wind/current/tide/visibility and operator
      schedules to deliver continuously updated ETAs with confidence intervals
      for each terminal/berth.
    - >-
      Predict dock occupancy and run a constraint-aware optimizer to assign and
      resequence berths/ramps; auto-detect potential conflicts 10–30 minutes
      before arrival and propose safe deconfliction actions.
    - >-
      Provide dispatcher and terminal dashboards (systemwide Gantt, heat maps)
      and mobile views for captains with advisory timing windows and
      target-speed guidance suggestions (non-mandatory, COLREGS-aware).
    - >-
      Integrate with ticketing/dispatch and passenger info to push live ETA and
      dock updates to riders and connecting bus/rail systems.
    - >-
      Offer what-if simulation for timetable planning, tide windows, maintenance
      outages, and special events to understand impact on OTP and dwell times.
    - >-
      Expose APIs/webhooks to embed ETAs, berth status, and alerts into existing
      control-room tools and public apps.
    - >-
      Deliver post-ops analytics (delay root causes, dwell time drivers, crew
      overtime correlation, conflict patterns) for continuous improvement.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    AI-driven ETA forecasts and berth/ramp sequencing purpose-built for
    passenger operations that reduce conflicts, wait times, and operating
    costs—delivering sub-5-minute coastal ETA accuracy, 20–40% fewer dock
    conflicts, and up to 15–30% lower passenger wait times within 90 days of
    deployment.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Route- and terminal-specific ETA/berth models trained on proprietary dock
    occupancy and conflict-resolution data, combined with pre-built integrations

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Ferry and terminal operations leaders (dispatchers, harbor masters, port
    schedulers) who need predictable arrivals and conflict‑free docks on Coastal
    and Great Lakes passenger routes.
  problem: >-
    - External: Unpredictable ETAs (weather, traffic, visibility) and limited
    berths/ramps cause conflicts, idle time, and missed connections.

    - Internal: Constant firefighting, stressed crews, frustrated passengers,
    and reputational risk.

    - Philosophical: People shouldn’t wait because data wasn’t used; operators
    deserve real‑time clarity over guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand the chaos of tides, fog, and peak crowds that break fixed
    timetables. Our team blends maritime operations and AI, with models
    validated on large‑scale historical AIS and terminal data. We integrate with
    your schedules and tools, and design for safety, manual override, and
    regulatory constraints.
  plan: >-
    - Step 1: Connect AIS and schedules; map docks/ramps and constraints.

    - Step 2: 30–60 day pilot to calibrate ETA accuracy and berth sequencing.

    - Step 3: Go live with real‑time recommendations, alerts, and APIs.

    - Assurance: No hardware install, manual override always, data secure,
    success metrics agreed upfront.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Book a live demo and start a low‑risk pilot.

    - Transitional: Get a route‑specific ETA accuracy brief and a
    dock‑utilization checklist.
  success: |-
    - Accurate ETAs and smooth berth sequencing.
    - Shorter passenger waits and faster turnarounds.
    - Fewer conflicts, cancellations, and overtime.
    - Higher on‑time performance, throughput, and customer satisfaction.
    - Lower idle fuel burn and clearer staffing plans.
  failure: |-
    - Ongoing dock conflicts and cascading delays.
    - Long passenger queues, refunds, and overtime costs.
    - Frustrated crews and lost public trust.
    - Missed revenue and avoidable regulatory scrutiny.

  problem:
    - Unreliable ETAs trigger cascading dock conflicts and missed connections.
    - >-
      Manual radio coordination can’t keep pace with weather, currents, and
      traffic variability.
    - >-
      Berths and ramps sit idle while vessels queue, creating long passenger
      lines.
    - >-
      Fragmented data (AIS, schedules, tides) limits real-time visibility and
      decisions.
    - Operators lack tools to resequence arrivals during disruptions.
    - Inconsistent passenger updates drive complaints and crowding.
  solution:
    - 'AI ingests live AIS to deliver port-specific, minute-level ETAs.'
    - Automatically sequences berths and ramps to avoid overlaps and dead time.
    - Real-time conflict detection with recommended adjustments for dispatch.
    - 'Unified timeline of vessels, docks, and headways for faster decisions.'
    - >-
      Targeted notifications to captains, dock staff, and passengers when plans
      change.
    - 'Open APIs to signage, apps, and control rooms for consistent, live ETAs.'
  features:
    - 'Ferry-tuned ETA model using AIS, speed profiles, weather, and currents.'
    - Dock timeline (Gantt) with drag-and-drop and instant impact preview.

      wake).
    - 'What-if scenarios for delays, capacity changes, and special events.'
    - 'Headway, on-time performance, and dwell tracking with SLA alerts.'
    - >-
      Multi-operator, multi-terminal, multi-berth support with role-based
      access.
    - >-
      Integrations: AIS/NMEA, GTFS-Flex schedules, ticketing counts,
      VMS/signage.
    - Mobile Ops mode for captains and dockmasters with offline fallback.
    - 'Audit trail, KPI dashboards, and exportable incident timelines.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect AIS feed and import routes, schedules, and dock assets.'
    - 'Set constraints: berth dimensions, ramp availability, turnaround times.'
    - Calibrate ETA model with recent voyage history.
    - Run a shadow pilot alongside current operations.
    - 'Go live with signage, passenger app, and dispatch integrations.'
    - Review KPIs monthly and tune sequencing rules for continuous gains.
