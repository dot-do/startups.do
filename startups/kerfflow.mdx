  problem:
    - >-
      Manual or ERP-native scheduling is infinite-capacity and ignores real
      bottlenecks (grinding/tensioning/brazing/coating), causing 10–25% late
      orders and constant reprioritization.
    - >-
      Batches and sequence dependencies (e.g., brazing furnace loads, coating
      run colors/chemistries, set/teeth profiles) are not modeled; planners
      spend 2–4 hours/day firefighting.
    - >-
      Highly variable cycle times from tool wear, rework, and operator skill
      cause inaccurate ETAs and broken customer promises.
    - >-
      Premium freight, overtime, and small-lot expedites inflate COGS by 2–6% to
      hit due dates.
    - >-
      No fast what-if simulation to decide: split lot vs. resequence vs.
      overtime vs. subcontract vs. changeover optimization.
    - >-
      WIP builds in front of bottlenecks; OEE and utilization on critical
      machines are 5–15 points below potential.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across ERP, spreadsheets, and floor systems (barcodes,
      MTConnect/OPC-UA); schedule adherence is opaque.
  solution:
    - >-
      Finite-capacity scheduling engine tuned to blade/tool routings with
      batching, sequence, tooling, and skill constraints.
    - >-
      Expedite agent that recommends economically optimal actions (resequencing,
      split lots, overtime windows, alternate routings, subcontract) with
      quantified impact on due dates and cost.
    - >-
      Continuous ETA recalculation and ATP/CTP to promise accurate ship dates to
      sales/CS.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: simulate schedule policies (e.g., drum-buffer-rope
      buffers, setup family sequencing, lot size changes) before committing to
      floor.
    - >-
      Machine and labor calendars, maintenance downtimes, and skill matrices
      enforced automatically; cross-shift leveling.
    - >-
      Lightweight integrations to common ERPs/MES and machine data
      (OPC-UA/MTConnect/barcode).
    - >-
      Supervisor mobile/visual boards: prioritized dispatch lists and constraint
      buffers at each work center.
    - >-
      Digital twin KPIs: monitor bottleneck utilization, queue times, and
      schedule adherence in real time.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Domain-specific, constraint-aware finite-capacity scheduling and WIP
    expedite agent for saw blade and hand tool lines that improves OTIF to 95%+,

  problem:
    - >-
      Whiteboards and spreadsheets can’t keep up with hot jobs and shifting
      bottlenecks.
    - >-
      Sequence-dependent setups (tooth geometry, coatings) are ignored, driving
      changeover waste.
    - >-
      Crews, skills, and oven/rack capacities aren’t modeled, causing missed
      promise dates.
    - Grinding queues explode while coating and packaging sit idle.
    - 'Rush orders disrupt flow; no clear, reliable ETA for customer service.'
    - 'Downtime, quality holds, and late material cause last-minute chaos.'
    - >-
      Data is scattered across ERP/MES and paper travelers—no single source of
      truth.
    - Supervisors spend hours expediting and walking the floor to reprioritize.
    - 'Partial shipments and rework aren’t planned, hurting OTD and margins.'
  solution:
    - >-
      Generate shop-ready, finite-capacity schedules that respect real
      constraints at every work center.

      late—no heroics required.
    - >-
      WIP Expedite Agent flags at-risk orders and proposes lowest-disruption
      fixes.
    - 'Give sales and CSRs reliable ETAs and capable-to-promise dates, instantly.'
