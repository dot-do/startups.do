  title: Dynamic Quote & Instant Payment Links

    - Front office
    - Dispatchers
  triggers:
    - Quote request via web/phone

    - Service type and constraints
    - Time/day/traffic
    - Photos (optional)
  steps:
    - Validate locations and compute loaded miles/time
    - >-
      Infer complexity from photos and rules (e.g., winch, dollies, low
      clearance)
    - >-
      Apply pricing matrix and taxes/fees; produce options
      (standard/rush/membership)
    - Generate itemized quote with terms and disclaimers
    - Send payment link; hold deposit; convert to job on payment
  tools:

leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual quoting is slow (3–7 minutes/lead), error-prone, and inconsistent
      across dispatchers, causing 15–30% lead drop-off before a price is given.
    - >-
      Under/over-pricing leads to margin leakage and lost jobs; operators report
      5–12% revenue variability by dispatcher and time-of-day.
    - >-
      Payment friction (waiting for card-on-arrival or invoicing) delays cash
      flow (DSO 3–7 days) and increases no-shows/cancellations.
    - >-
      After-hours coverage is weak; many small operators miss calls or give
      ballpark prices without context (terrain, traffic, equipment), reducing
      win rate.
    - >-
      Existing tools either handle dispatch or payments, but few connect
      real-time price intelligence with instant, mobile-friendly pay links.
    - >-
      Chargebacks and disputes arise from unclear scope-of-work (winch-out vs.
      tow, low-clearance, mileage), lacking itemized quotes and consent capture.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-powered quote engine that ingests pickup/drop-off, vehicle type,
      incident type, terrain/elevation, traffic, time-of-day, and equipment
      needs to output a firm, itemized price with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Instant pay links via SMS/email/WhatsApp with Apple Pay/Google Pay
      support; pre-authorization and upfront deposits to reduce cancellations.
    - >-
      Smart rules engine for surcharges (after-hours, winch-out, low-clearance,
      mud/snow), municipality fees, and tolls with geo-fenced logic.
    - >-
      Two-click website widget and call-center console to turn inbound calls/web
      leads into quotes and payment links without leaving the screen.
    - >-
      Integrations with tow management systems (e.g., Towbook/Traxero) and
      payment processors (Stripe/Square) for dispatch sync and automated
      receipts.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: outcomes (accepted/declined, time-to-arrival,
      refunds) continuously retrain the pricing model per locale and partner.
    - >-
      Fraud and dispute reduction: itemized scope, GPS-stamped locations,
      before/after photos, terms acceptance, and digital signature capture.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard: quote-to-close rate, AOV, response time, margin
      impact, cash flow, and surcharge performance by agent and time block.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Under 30 seconds from inquiry to firm, itemized quote and instant mobile pay
    link—priced by local market conditions, distance, terrain, time-of-day, and
    equipment—boosting close rate 10–25% and reducing DSO from days to minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop, locale-specific acceptance and margin data tied to itemized
    quotes and outcomes, creating a pricing flywheel competitors without
    operator integrations can’t easily replicate; embedded workflows in dispatch
    and communications reduce switching and create defensibility.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Independent light-duty towing companies (1–20 trucks) seeking faster
      quoting and faster cash collection.

      Mid-sized multi-depot tow operators (20–100 trucks) needing consistent
      pricing across teams and shifts.
    - >-

      ROI demo and local price audit.

      listings, co-selling, rev-share).
