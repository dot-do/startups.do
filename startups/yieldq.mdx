leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as scattered emails with PDFs/scans/spreadsheets; retyping
      BOMs takes 15–45 minutes per RFQ and is error-prone, creating quote
      backlogs and slow response (>24 hours).
    - >-
      Estimators rely on flat waste factors (e.g., +10–20%) and rules of thumb;
      yield varies by species/grade/thickness and cut pattern, causing ±5–10
      margin point swings.
    - >-
      Labor/machine times are estimated inconsistently; promised lead times
      don’t reflect current capacity, leading to missed ship dates and rush
      costs.
    - >-
      Price inputs are outdated or not customer-specific; commodity swings and
      inventory carrying cost aren’t reflected, resulting in lost deals or
      underpriced orders.
    - >-
      No closed-loop analytics: hit rates by customer/SKU, margin leakage, and
      lead-time accuracy are unknown; pricing doesn’t improve with outcomes.
    - >-
      Estimator expertise is tribal; onboarding a new estimator takes 6–12
      months and productivity is limited by a few key people.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to an RFQ inbox or drag-and-drop RFQs; auto-extract line items
      (species, grade, thickness, target sizes, quantities, tolerances).
    - >-
      Simulate yield using species/grade conversion, kerf, defect allowances,
      and cut patterns (rip/chop/resaw) to compute required input board feet and
      waste.
    - >-
      Estimate labor and machine time by routing (e.g., MBR -> rip saw -> chop
      -> planer), with setup/changeover and throughput by machine center.
    - >-
      Price each line using inventory costs and commodity indices, with
      customer-tier markups, minimum margin guardrails, and competitive nudges.
    - >-
      Calculate feasible lead time from a finite-capacity model using current
      WIP, labor calendars, shifts, and setup loads.
    - >-
      Generate a branded quote (PDF/email) with terms, alternates (e.g.,
      substitute species/grades), and validity dates; route for approval if
      needed.
    - >-
      Sync quotes, items, and customers to ERP/CRM; track outcomes to
      continually improve yield factors and pricing parameters.
    - >-
      Provide dashboards for RFQ-to-PO funnel, quote cycle time, margin by
      customer/product, lead-time accuracy, and estimator productivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn RFQs into accurate, priced quotes with capacity-based lead times in
    minutes, not hours—by automatically extracting BOMs from emails/PDFs,
    simulating yield and labor, and applying guardrailed pricing tuned to your
    costs, inventory, and customer tiers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically specialized dataset and optimizer for cut-stock/reman with
    proven yield and lead-time accuracy, coupled with customer-specific pricing
    learnings and ERP/OEM integrations. As models learn from every RFQ and
    outcome, quoting quality compounds—hard for generalist tools to replicate.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Small-to-mid sized cut-stock/remanufacturing plants (10–250
      employees) performing ripping, chop, resaw, and planing for OEMs and
      distributors.
    - >-
      Integrated sawmills with reman lines needing component quoting for
      furniture, millwork, pallets, and packaging.

  character: >-
    Estimators and operations leaders at cut-stock, resawing, and planing shops
    who need to turn RFQs into accurate quotes fast.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQs arrive as messy emails/PDFs and BOMs need manual entry;
    yield, kerf, defect, and labor vary by species and dimensions; deadlines are
    tight. Internal: late nights in spreadsheets, fear of mispricing or
    overpromising lead times. Philosophical: skilled wood shops should spend
    time making wood, and buyers deserve fast, fair, data-backed quotes.
  guide: >-
    We understand 321912 workflows and the realities of grade mix, recovery, and
    machine centers. Our Quote and Yield-Pricing Assistant uses AI to extract
    BOMs from emails/PDFs, model yield and labor, and draft price and lead-time
    options so you quote with confidence.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect your inbox/ERP and upload a few RFQs. 2) Review the
    auto-extracted BOM and the suggested yield, labor, price, and lead time;
    adjust rules and margins. 3) Approve and send the quote or export to
    ERP/CRM—your team stays in control. Agreement: you approve every quote; your
    data stays private.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot on your next 10 RFQs.
    Transitional: See a sample quote and run the ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Quotes go out in minutes, win rates rise, margins stabilize, schedules
    smooth, and teams spend more time producing and less time wrestling
    spreadsheets.
  failure: >-
    Slow, error-prone quoting leads to missed deadlines, margin leaks, lost
    bids, idle or overburdened machines, and frustrated customers.

  problem:
    - Quoting takes hours of manual spreadsheet work.
    - BOMs are buried in messy emails and PDFs.
    - 'Yield, kerf, and defect assumptions vary by estimator—margins slip.'
    - Inconsistent pricing creates rework and customer friction.

    - Tribal knowledge makes training and scaling hard.
  solution:
    - Ingests emails/PDFs and auto-extracts structured BOMs.
    - 'Predicts true yield with grade, kerf, shrinkage, and trim loss modeling.'
    - 'Estimates machine time and labor for cut stock, resawing, and planing.'
    - 'Generates customer-ready quotes with pricing, waste, and lead times.'
    - Optimizes stock selection to protect margins and reduce scrap.
