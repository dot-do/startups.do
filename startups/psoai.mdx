  problem:
    - >-
      Schedulers spend 6–20 hours/week in spreadsheets or basic APS tools
      manually resequencing jobs when orders change, machines go down, or
      materials are late.
    - >-
      High mix/low-to-medium volume manufacturers suffer 10–25% late orders and
      excessive changeovers due to suboptimal sequencing and long setup
      families.
    - >-
      Existing APS/MES modules are hard to configure, slow to recompute (10–120
      min), and lack fast what-if capabilities; planners avoid frequent replans.
    - >-
      Setup and changeover times are poorly estimated; actuals differ by 15–40%
      from standard times, leading to inaccurate capacity loading.
    - >-
      Integration to ERP/MES is costly (>$100k) and brittle; data hygiene blocks
      ROI and delays value realization.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid constraint programming + heuristics + ML duration estimates to
      minimize weighted tardiness and setups while respecting
      resource/skill/material constraints.
    - >-
      Sub-minute rescheduling for typical plants (up to ~200 resources) to
      handle rush orders, breakdowns, and material delays.
    - >-
      Role-based web UI with finite capacity boards, dispatch lists by
      workcenter/line, and operator mobile view.
    - >-
      What-if sandbox: insert/cancel orders, modify routing/shift calendars,
      simulate breakdowns, and compare KPIs across candidate schedules.
    - >-
      Data connectors and data quality layer for ERP/MES routing, BOM, WIP,
      calendars, and actuals; incremental updates every 1–5 minutes.
    - >-
      Continuous learning: ML model refines setup and run-time estimates from
      actuals, reducing estimate error over time.
    - >-
      Multi-objective tuning: slider weights for tardiness, setups, changeovers,
      and WIP; per-customer due date priorities.
    - >-
      Auditability and constraints explainer to build trust with planners and
      operators.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Cut late orders and changeovers with AI-grade, constraint-based schedules
    that recompute in seconds, generate ready-to-run dispatch lists, and let
    planners test what-if scenarios before the shift changes—integrated to your
    ERP/MES in weeks, not months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A fast, explainable hybrid scheduling engine that combines
    sequence-dependent setup optimization with continuously learned duration
    estimates, packaged with prebuilt ERP/MES connectors and a what-if sandbox
    that compares KPI deltas in seconds—validated by lighthouse plants and
    embedded partner integrations that reduce time-to-value to weeks.
