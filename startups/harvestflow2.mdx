  problem:
    - >-
      Growers and custom harvesters lose 5–15% of potential profit due to
      suboptimal harvest sequencing, weather delays, and soil trafficability
      issues.
    - >-
      Combine fleets average 55–70% utilization during harvest; idle time from
      rain, soft fields, and logistics causes missed optimal maturity windows.
    - >-
      Harvesting at suboptimal grain moisture increases drying costs
      ($0.02–$0.05 per bushel per percentage point moisture) or shatter losses
      (1–3+ bu/ac for soy/canola when too dry).
    - >-
      Soil compaction from operating on wet fields reduces next year yield by
      1–5% and increases fuel use; operators lack a reliable, field-specific
      trafficability forecast.
    - >-
      Coordinating machines, grain carts, trucks, and elevator/storage capacity
      is error-prone, especially across non-contiguous fields and multiple
      growers.
    - >-
      Existing tools show weather and basic field status but don’t generate a
      daily, capacity-aware harvest schedule that adapts to real-time
      conditions.
    - >-
      Seasonal labor and tight windows create high cognitive load; managers need
      a plan they can explain, adjust, and execute quickly with crews.
  solution:
    - >-
      Predict crop readiness windows using phenology, accumulated heat units,
      remote sensing, and moisture models for each field.
    - >-
      Forecast soil trafficability (go/no-go and risk score) from soil maps,
      recent precipitation, evapotranspiration, drainage class, and forecast
      rain—minimizing compaction risk.
    - >-
      Optimize daily harvest schedule considering machine throughput, header
      widths, road distances, crew shifts, grain cart/truck availability,
      elevator hours, and storage capacity.
    - >-
      Provide “Plan-A/Plan-B” scenarios with weather risk bands (e.g., 30%, 60%,
      90% rain probability) and clear triggers for switching plans.
    - >-
      Live re-optimization with telematics data (combine location, engine hours,
      throughput) and operator feedback from mobile devices.
    - >-
      ROI dashboard quantifying saved drying costs, reduced shatter loss,
      avoided compaction, and increased machine utilization.
    - >-
      Simple interfaces: web for planners, offline-capable mobile for operators
      with turn-by-turn to next field and priority list.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Daily, field-by-field harvest plans that maximize yield and machine uptime
    by fusing crop readiness, soil trafficability, weather risk, logistics, and
    machine capacity—delivered with integrations to your existing equipment and

  character: >-
    Farm operations managers and custom harvesters who need a daily, data-driven
    plan for which fields to harvest to protect yield and keep machines
    productive.
  problem: >-
    External - Unpredictable weather; uneven crop maturity; variable soil
    trafficability; limited machine capacity; scattered data. Internal - Stress
    and second-guessing each call; fear of rutting fields or missing the optimal
    window. Philosophical - Harvest decisions should be as precise as your
    equipment, not a gamble.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure of calling the right field each day. The Harvest
    Readiness & Scheduling Agent analyzes crop readiness, weather, soil
    trafficability, and machine capacity to recommend the best fields and
    sequence. Built with agronomy and fleet-ops best practices; integrates with
    your maps and machine telemetry.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect field boundaries, crops and targets, machines, and work windows.
    2) Set priorities and constraints (e.g., avoid wet soils, finish contracts
    first). 3) Receive a daily plan—field order, timing, machine allocation, and
    routes—adjust and publish to crews. Privacy-first; no new hardware required.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct - Book a demo and start a pilot on your fields. Transitional -
    Download the Harvest Readiness Checklist and ROI calculator.
  success: >-
    Confident, calm harvest days—maximize yield and quality, minimize compaction
    and downtime, hit moisture and delivery targets, improve machine
    utilization, align crews, and finish before weather closes the window.
  failure: >-
    Missed optimal windows; rutted fields and yield loss; idle or misallocated
    machines; overtime and fuel waste; contract penalties; chaotic, reactive
    days.
