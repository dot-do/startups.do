  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive via email/portals in PDFs, images, and CAD drawings; manual
      parsing takes 45–120 minutes per RFQ and is error-prone.
    - >-
      Estimators struggle to standardize costs for varied textile products
      (covers, awnings, filtration media, straps, banners) leading to margin
      leakage and inconsistent pricing.
    - >-
      Lead-time estimates are guesswork due to supplier variability (fabric
      availability, trims, hardware) and shop load; missed delivery dates hurt
      win rates and customer trust.
    - >-
      Material price volatility (fabric, webbing, thread, hardware) isn’t
      reflected quickly in quotes; spreadsheets/ERP fields go stale.
    - >-
      Small estimating teams create a quoting bottleneck; slow turnaround
      (>24–48 hours) loses deals to faster competitors.
    - >-
      Compliance-heavy jobs (Berry/ITAR/CMMC/UL flame ratings) require extra
      documentation that delays quotes and introduces risk.
    - >-
      Disconnected tools (email, ERP, PLM, spreadsheets) cause duplicate entry
      and version control issues during revisions and re-quotes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest RFQs from email inboxes, portals, and EDI; normalize PDFs, images,
      and CAD attachments with industrial-grade OCR/CAD parsers.
    - >-
      Detect and classify product type (e.g., flat cover, 3D shroud, sling,
      banner) and required standards (e.g., fire rating, Berry compliance) from
      text and drawings.
    - >-
      Generate a draft BOM with fabric, webbing, trim, thread, hardware;
      auto-suggest material grades, widths, and finishes based on historical
      wins and spec matches.
    - >-
      Estimate material usage via pattern heuristics and nesting for common
      geometries; factor waste, seam allowances, hems, bindings, and
      reinforcements.
    - >-
      Calculate standard labor times (cutting, sewing, hardware install, QA,
      packaging) using motion/time libraries calibrated for textile processes;
      apply shop-specific rates and overhead.
    - >-
      Pull live or recent supplier pricing and availability; compute costed
      quote with target margin rules and competitive pricing bands; optimize for
      price and lead-time.
    - >-
      Simulate lead-time using supplier lead-times and current shop capacity;
      quote multiple options (e.g., standard vs expedite) with confidence bands.
    - >-
      Auto-generate a branded quote package with drawings, assumptions,
      compliance statements (Berry/ITAR), and terms; route for internal approval
      and push to ERP/CRM.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: compare quoted vs actuals (material/labor/lead-time)
      to reduce error over time and recommend price/margin updates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Turn inbound RFQs and drawings into costed, compliant quotes in minutes—not
    days—using textile-specific AI that extracts requirements, builds bills of
    materials and labor routings, simulates lead-times, and pushes approved
    quotes into your ERP with guardrails for margin and compliance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A textile-specialized costing engine and annotated dataset that map drawings
    to BOMs/routings with proven accuracy, reinforced by supplier-integrated
    pricing and lead-time simulation. Combined with ERP-native integrations and
    compliance-ready deployments (including ITAR/air-gapped), this creates a
    high-switching-cost workflow embedded in customers’ quoting, approval, and
    order processes.
