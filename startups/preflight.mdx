leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Preflight for training flights is fragmented across multiple systems
      (weather, NOTAMs, routes, W&B, FRAT, dispatch), leading to 20–40 minutes
      per sortie and inconsistent quality.
    - >-
      Risk assessments (PAVE/IMSAFE/FRAT) are inconsistently applied and rarely
      data-driven; schools struggle to enforce SOPs and risk gates at scale.
    - >-
      W&B and performance calculations are error-prone, often using screenshots
      or spreadsheets with no audit trail; dispatchers spend time re-checking
      and sending students back for corrections.
    - >-
      NOTAMs and TFRs are hard for new pilots to interpret; critical items
      (e.g., runway closures, GPS outages) get overlooked.
    - >-
      Dispatch-quality packages and recordkeeping are labor-intensive; many
      schools lack a consistent, signed, and archived preflight record for
      audits and standardization.
    - >-
      Instructors spend billable time teaching preflight mechanics vs
      aeronautical decision-making; schools want to reduce time-to-solo and
      standardize training outcomes.
    - >-
      Existing tools are pilot-centric EFBs, not training/ops-centric: weak
      workflow, limited FRAT enforcement, minimal school SOP integration,
      limited multi-aircraft fleet templates.
    - >-
      No easy way to pre-generate briefings from the schedule so students arrive
      prepared; last-minute go/no-go decisions are rushed.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven preflight generator that ingests schedule, aircraft profile,
      student stage, and local SOPs to produce a standardized briefing
      (Wx/NOTAMs/route/performance/W&B/FRAT) for approval and e-signature.
    - >-
      Adaptive risk engine combining PAVE/IMSAFE, real-time conditions (winds,
      DA, ceilings), student currency, and school-specific FRAT to trigger gates
      (e.g., crosswind limits by stage) and escalation workflows to
      instructors/chief pilots.
    - >-
      Integrated W&B + performance calculators with POH-based interpolation,
      tail-specific W&B profiles, runway analysis (head/crosswind component,
      takeoff/landing distance factors), plus density altitude and obstacle
      notes.
    - >-
      NOTAM/TFR comprehension layer that classifies and highlights operationally
      critical items (runway closures, GPS RAIM, lighting outages) and presents
      plain-English summaries to students.
    - >-
      Automated route suggestions (VFR and IFR student training routes) that
      avoid SUA/TFRs, incorporate preferred routes, winds aloft, and school
      training areas; export to popular EFBs.
    - >-
      Dispatch workflow: pre-generate briefs from schedule; notify student/CFI;
      edits tracked; approvals and digital signatures captured; immutable
      PDF/JSON archived.
    - >-
      Training-first content: scenario prompts aligned with ACS tasks,
      instructor notes, stage-check templates, and “teach-back” questions to
      improve ADM.
    - >-
      Compliance hooks: optional Leidos 1800WXBRIEF linkage to record an
      official briefing, audit logs with timestamps and conditions snapshot for
      each sortie.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Generate a dispatch-quality, school-standardized preflight package in under
    60 seconds that reduces briefing time by 50–70%, enforces SOP-based risk
    gates, and creates an auditable record for every training flight.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Training-first risk and dispatch workflow that encodes each school’s SOPs
    and stage gates into the preflight process, combined with a growing
    proprietary dataset of school-specific FRAT calibrations, tail-specific
    performance/W&B profiles, and annotated NOTAM semantics—creating switching
    costs and superior standardization that general-purpose EFBs don’t offer.

    Flight schools, CFIs, and student pilots who need fast, reliable,
    standardized preflight briefs for every lesson.
  problem: >-
    - External: Fragmented tools and manual workflows to gather Wx, NOTAMs,
    route, performance, W&B, and risk—easy to miss details.

    - Internal: Anxiety and cognitive load from assembling briefs under time
    pressure.

    - Philosophical: Every training flight deserves dispatch-quality rigor
    without adding paperwork or guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy: We’ve felt the scramble before a lesson and the uncertainty of “Did
    we catch everything?”

    Authority: Built by ex-dispatchers and CFIs; aligns with FAA/ICAO briefing
    standards; integrates authoritative data sources for verifiable, audit-ready
    packages.
  plan: >-
    Process Plan:

    1) Create aircraft profiles and preferred training routes.

    2) Select lesson/time; Copilot auto-builds a dispatch-quality package (Wx,
    NOTAMs, route, performance, W&B, risk).

    3) Review, annotate, approve, and release to the student; archive for
    audits.

    Agreement Plan:

    - Secure, role-based access with instructor-in-the-loop approvals.

    - Uses authoritative FAA/NOAA/ICAO data; sources cited in every package.

    - API/LMS/dispatch integrations to fit existing SOPs.
  callToAction: >-
    Primary: Start a free trial or book a 15-minute demo today.

    Transitional: Download a sample preflight package; get the risk assessment
    checklist; view API docs.
  success: >-
    - Faster briefs and more time for instruction and flying.

    - Consistent, dispatch-quality packages across the school.

    - Improved readiness and safety culture; fewer day-of surprises and scrubbed
    lessons.

    - Audit-ready records and clear instructor oversight.
  failure: >-
    - Missed NOTAMs or weather hazards leading to delays or incidents.

    - Performance/W&B errors and inconsistent SOPs across instructors.

    - Wasted training time, overwhelmed students, and avoidable checkride
    setbacks.
