  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs for turned parts arrive in high volume and require 30–90 minutes each
      to quote manually, causing missed due dates and low response rates.
    - >-
      Estimating cycle time on lathes/Swiss (including live tooling, cross/axial
      ops, bar handling, cutoff, secondary ops) is error-prone, leading to
      margin leakage or lost bids.
    - >-
      Material usage and bar size selection are manually calculated with
      spreadsheets; waste and remnant handling are inconsistently applied.
    - >-
      Expertise is concentrated in a few senior estimators; shops risk delays
      when they are unavailable and struggle to train new staff.
    - >-
      No closed-loop: actual run-times and scrap rates rarely feed back into
      quoting models, so accuracy does not improve over time.
    - >-
      Duplicative data entry across CAD/PDF, email, ERP/MES, and CRM leads to
      errors and rework.
    - >-
      Compliance and IP security (ITAR/DFARS/AS9100 contexts) make cloud tools
      risky without proper controls, slowing adoption.
    - >-
      Routing definitions differ by customer/job; manual handoffs between
      estimating, programming, and scheduling generate misalignment and late
      changes.
  solution:
    - >-
      Automated drawing/CAD ingestion: extract features, tolerances, materials,
      finishes, quantities, and revisions from PDFs and 3D models (STEP,
      Parasolid).
    - >-
      Turned-feature recognition specialized for lathes/Swiss: OD/ID turning,
      grooves, threads, drilling/tapping (axial/cross), knurling, part-off,
      sub-spindle transfer, live-tool milling.
    - >-
      Cycle-time estimation: hybrid physics (feeds/speeds, engagement, tool
      changes, bar advance, chucking/collet) + ML calibrated to actual run-time
      history by machine/tool/material.
    - >-
      Material and bar stock optimization: recommend bar size, stickout, remnant
      strategy, cutoff allowance, and expected waste; compute material cost with
      supplier feeds or shop price lists.
    - >-
      Auto-routing: propose ops sequence (lathe/Swiss primary, secondary
      deburr/part cleaning, inspection steps, heat treat/plating if required)
      with setup and queue times.
    - >-
      Quote builder: cost breakdown (material, machine time, setup, tooling,
      overhead, risk), target margin/price ladders by qty tier, lead-times;
      one-click push to ERP/CRM.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: estimators can edit features, ops, feeds/speeds,
      and pricing rules with full audit trail and versioning.
    - >-
      Closed-loop learning: ingest actuals from ERP/MES/CNC to reduce estimate
      error over time; highlight biggest drivers of variance for process
      improvement.
    - >-
      Risk flags: callouts that affect time/cost (tight GD&T, surface finish,
      small diameter L/D, exotic alloys, required certs) and suggest
      mitigations.
    - >-
      Security: tenant isolation, optional US-only/ITAR-compliant hosting, SSO,
      audit logs, data residency controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    From RFQ to accurate, review-ready quotes for turned parts in minutes—not
    hours—by parsing prints/models, auto-estimating cycle-time, material, and
    routing for lathes/Swiss. Hybrid physics+ML models calibrated to each shop’s
    machines and tooling deliver <10% cycle-time MAPE post-calibration, boosting
    on-time quote rate, win rate, and margin confidence while meeting ITAR-grade
    security.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A closed-loop, shop-calibrated modeling stack purpose-built for lathes/Swiss
    that blends physics and ML and learns from each customer’s actual run-times.
    Over time this yields a proprietary, anonymized benchmarking dataset for
    turned parts and OEM-specific machine templates that competitors without
    vertical focus or feedback loops struggle to match. Optional ITAR-compliant
    deployment and on-prem edge parsing further raise the barrier to entry.
  customerSegments:

    Estimators and operations leaders at precision turned-parts manufacturers
    who want fast, consistent, profitable quotes for lathes and Swiss work.
  problem: >-
    External: RFQ packages arrive in mixed formats; manual time studies,
    material calcs, and routing take hours and delay responses. Internal:
    Estimators are overloaded and worry about mispricing. Philosophical: Quoting
    a turned part shouldn’t take days or rely on tribal knowledge.
  guide: >-
    We understand the pressure to respond fast without sacrificing margin. Our
    RFQ-to-Quote Assistant parses drawings/CAD, estimates cycle-time, material,
    and routing for lathes/Swiss, and is built by manufacturing and AI experts
    with secure, shop-tested workflows.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload the RFQ package (PDFs, prints, STEP). 2) AI extracts features and
    auto-builds cycle-time, material, and routing. 3) Review, adjust levers, and
    export the quote to ERP/CRM.
  callToAction: Book a 20-minute demo or start a pilot with a sample RFQ.
  success: >-
    Quotes in minutes with consistent pricing, clear routings, and traceable
    assumptions; higher win rates, protected margins, and scalable quoting
    capacity without adding headcount.
  failure: >-
    Late, inconsistent quotes; lost bids and margin erosion; estimator burnout;
    reliance on tribal knowledge and error-prone spreadsheets.
