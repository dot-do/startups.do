  problem:
    - >-
      Rental providers in consumer electronics and appliances face monthly churn
      of 2–6%, driven by voluntary cancellations (price sensitivity, moving,
      product dissatisfaction) and involuntary churn (failed payments/dunning).
    - >-
      Data is siloed across billing, CRM, service tickets, delivery/field
      service, collections, and messaging platforms, making it hard to build
      reliable churn risk signals or orchestrate timely outreach.
    - >-
      Retention campaigns are mostly blanket or rule-based; lack of uplift
      modeling leads to discount leakage and negative ROI campaigns.
    - >-
      Win-back is reactive and slow (often 30–60 days post-churn), resulting in
      higher reacquisition costs and lost lifetime value.
    - >-
      Limited experimentation capability (A/B only, no holdouts or multi-armed
      bandits) means teams cannot quickly find best-performing offers or
      channels.
    - >-
      Frontline agents lack real-time next-best-action guidance; inconsistent
      scripts and fragmented tools reduce save rates.
    - >-
      Compliance and consent management across SMS/WhatsApp/voice/email is
      complex; fear of regulatory violations throttles proactive outreach.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data layer with prebuilt connectors to subscription billing
      (Chargebee, Zuora, Stripe Billing), CRM/helpdesk (Salesforce, Zendesk,
      Freshdesk), payments (Stripe, Adyen, Razorpay), CPaaS (Twilio,
      MessageBird, Sinch), and field service tools.
    - >-
      Daily churn risk scoring with reason codes (payment risk, service
      dissatisfaction, device fault, competitive threat, relocation). Targets:
      AUC >0.82, precision@top-decile >0.35.
    - >-
      Next-best-action engine: personalized offers (discounts, plan changes,
      payment plans, swap/upgrade, free service visit), channel selection,
      send-time optimization, and budget constraints to maximize retained gross
      margin.
    - >-
      Outreach orchestration across SMS, WhatsApp, email, IVR, in-app, and
      agent-assist with consent management (GDPR/CCPA/TCPA).
    - >-
      Experimentation and uplift modeling: holdouts, multi-armed bandit
      allocation, and treatment-effect models to avoid giving discounts to
      customers who would stay anyway.
    - >-
      Win-back module: recency-based scoring and offer bundles for churned users
      (within 7, 30, and 90 days).
    - >-
      Agent assist: sidebar in CRM with live risk score, recommended script,
      concession level, and approval workflows.
    - >-
      IoT/telemetry hooks (where available) to trigger proactive repair/replace
      offers for at-risk devices.
    - >-
      Reporting: cohort-level retention uplift, discount efficiency (retained
      margin per $ discount), CLV lift, and offer/channel performance
      dashboards.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS, VPC-hosted, or on-prem connector with
      data minimization; SOC 2 roadmap and DPA templates.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce subscriber churn by 20–35% within 90 days by unifying rental-specific
    data and automating next-best actions across channels. Performance-based
    pricing with provable uplift via holdouts and incrementality testing.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Rental-specific treatment-effect models with interpretable reason codes,
    prebuilt connectors to the rental tech stack, and a proven playbook library
    delivering measurable uplift; privacy-preserving cross-client benchmarking
    and performance-based contracts reduce buyer risk.
