leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Slow, manual quoting (Excel/ERP exports + email) causes 24–72 hour delays;
      buyers move on or negotiate competitors while waiting.
    - >-
      Margin leakage from inconsistent cost bases: outdated vendor price files,
      freight underestimation, missed fuel surcharges, and ignoring melt-season
      packaging adders.
    - >-
      Inventory realities aren’t priced in: aging/overstocked items, short-dated
      lots, case-pack constraints, and seasonal dead stock not prioritized or
      incentivized.
    - >-
      Freight and customer-tier complexity (LTL vs parcel vs routed,
      temperature-control, zone-based rates, MOQs) is hard to calculate per
      quote line, leading to +/-5–10% landed cost errors.
    - >-
      Approval friction: sales reps draft emails and chase manager sign-off;
      leaders lack guardrails to prevent under-margin quotes or off-contract
      pricing.
    - >-
      Seasonality (Halloween, Holiday, Valentine’s, Easter) drives frequent
      vendor increases and promo funding changes; updates don’t reach quoting
      fast enough.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest live costs (vendor price files, rebates, trade funds), inventory by
      lot/expiry, customer tiers, and freight tables; compute true landed cost
      per line in real time.
    - >-
      Dynamic guardrails: enforce floor margin by brand/segment/customer, flag
      exceptions, and auto-route for approval when needed.
    - >-
      Freight intelligence: pick optimal mode (parcel/LTL/routed), include
      fuel/oversize/melt-season packaging adders, and respect MOQs/case packs.
    - >-
      Inventory-aware pricing: surface substitutes, nudge movement of
      short-dated/overstock SKUs with targeted discounting while protecting
      A-brand margins.
    - >-
      Seasonality engine: auto-apply seasonal uplift/markdown policies, promo
      calendars, and vendor-funded deals with start/end dates.
    - >-
      Email co-pilot: draft buyer-ready quote emails in the seller’s tone, with
      item rationales and freight notes; attach ERP/PDF quotes when available.
    - >-
      Auditability: line-level rationale, cost components, and approval trail
      for finance and compliance.
    - >-
      Low-friction integrations: connectors for common ERPs (NetSuite, SAP B1,
      Microsoft Dynamics, Sage), WMS, CRM (Salesforce), EDI (SPS/TrueCommerce),
      and carrier rating APIs.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Real-time, guardrail-safe quotes that reflect true landed cost and inventory
    reality—auto-drafted into buyer-ready emails—lifting gross margins by 50–150
    bps and cutting quote turnaround from days to minutes.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-tuned pricing engine for confectionery that embeds melt-season
    freight rules, case-pack/MOQ quirks, expiry-aware discounting, and vendor
    promo funding—combined with a growing, anonymized benchmark dataset of quote
    speed, margin, and freight variance by season and channel. Pre-built
    ERP/EDI/freight integrations shorten time-to-value to weeks, not quarters.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Confectionery wholesale sales and pricing teams (NAICS 424450) who must send
    fast, accurate quotes to retailers, c-stores, and distributors without
    sacrificing margin.
  problem: >-
    - External: Volatile costs (sugar/cocoa), vendor promos/allowances, freight
    zones, temperature-control fees, inventory constraints/allocations, and
    customer-specific tiers make manual quoting slow and error-prone.

    - Internal: Reps feel constant pressure to respond first, fear pricing
    mistakes, and get stuck in approval bottlenecks.

    - Philosophical: You shouldn’t lose shelf space or margin because pricing
    data is buried in spreadsheets or delayed by process.
