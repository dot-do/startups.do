  problem:
    - >-
      Estimators spend 8–20 hours per bid manually tracing structural steel and
      precast elements from PDFs/models, limiting throughput to ~8–12 bids/month
      per estimator.
    - >-
      Manual takeoff introduces 3–7% quantity variance and missed
      hardware/embeds, causing margin erosion or rework when projects are
      awarded.
    - >-
      Revisions are frequent; re-doing takeoffs for delta sets can consume
      30–50% of the original effort and introduces version control errors.
    - >-
      Price volatility and supplier lead times make it hard to maintain accurate
      BOM pricing; many firms still use outdated spreadsheets or email threads
      for RFQs.
    - >-
      Existing generic takeoff tools are not steel/precast-specific and don’t
      extract connections, bolts, welds, embeds, or shop/erection labor with
      sufficient accuracy.
    - >-
      Talent shortage: experienced estimators are retiring; firms need to
      upskill juniors and increase estimator leverage without sacrificing
      quality.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven parsing of structural drawings (PDF) and models (IFC, Revit,
      Tekla) to extract members, connections, plates, bolts, welds, embeds, and
      rebar for precast components.
    - >-
      Automated BOM generation with supplier-ready breakdown:
      shape/size/grade/length, camber, coating, shop/erection labor factors,
      waste, and secondary materials (studs, grout, shims, lifting anchors).
    - >-
      Dynamic pricing: integrate mill/service center quotes, steel indices
      (CRU/Platts), and customer price libraries; auto-generate RFQs where live
      pricing is unavailable.
    - >-
      Estimator review UI: sheet markups, element-by-element confidence scoring,
      quick overrides, and audit trails; side-by-side revision compare with
      delta highlighting and quantity change report.
    - >-
      Seamless exports: CSV/Excel, Tekla EPM/STRUMIS imports, Sage/CMiC ERP,
      Procore/ACC documents; Bluebeam and PlanSwift plugins.
    - >-
      Quality controls: human-in-the-loop validation option with 24-hour SLA;
      rule checks (e.g., bolt adequacy vs hole count, connection type
      completeness).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Produce a priced, estimator-ready structural steel and precast BOM with
    marked-up sheets in minutes—not days—complete with confidence scores, change
    deltas, and turnkey exports to Tekla EPM/STRUMIS/ERP. Increase estimator
    throughput 2–4x while reducing quantity variance to under 1.5% on tonnage.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A growing, domain-specific dataset of steel/precast drawings and models with
    connection- and embed-level annotations, continuously enriched by estimator
    corrections through a human-in-the-loop feedback loop and revision-delta
    labeling. Tight integrations with Tekla EPM/STRUMIS and supplier pricing
    sources create switching costs and a performance gap generalist takeoff
    tools cannot match.
  customerSegments:
    - >-
      Primary: Structural steel fabricators (5–500 employees) with in-house
      estimating teams, North America/EU/Australia.

    External: Manual takeoffs from drawings/models are slow, inconsistent, and
    error‑prone; changes and RFIs create rework and missed scope. Internal: Bid
    deadlines create stress and doubt in the numbers; teams burn nights/weekends
    and still feel exposed. Philosophical: Experts shouldn’t spend hours
    counting steel — accuracy and clarity should be immediate and transparent.
