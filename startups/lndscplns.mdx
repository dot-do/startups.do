leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual competitive and market landscaping is slow and costly: consultants
      report 20–40 hours per project to build a defensible competitor matrix
      with citations and pricing details.
    - >-
      Information is fragmented and volatile: pricing pages change, features are
      renamed, and sources span websites, filings, review sites, marketplaces,
      and social—leading to inconsistency and rework.
    - >-
      Outputs are not standardized: firms lack a consistent taxonomy for
      features/benefits, making comparisons across projects difficult and
      error-prone.
    - >-
      Citations and auditability are mandatory for client deliverables, yet
      tracking provenance across dozens of sources is tedious and often
      incomplete.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring is under-resourced: firms rarely budget for ongoing
      updates, so deliverables are stale within weeks, eroding client
      confidence.
  solution:
    - >-
      Agent-based research that structures web/DB data into a normalized
      knowledge graph of companies, products, features, and pricing with full
      source citations and screenshots.
    - >-
      Auto-generated competitor matrices with standardized taxonomies by
      industry; one-click export to PowerPoint/Google Slides and Excel/Sheets
      with firm-branded templates.
    - >-
      Pricing intelligence module that detects package tiers, price points,
      discounts, and usage-based metrics; archives screenshots for evidence and
      time-stamps changes.
    - >-
      Trend brief generator that synthesizes emerging themes,
      funding/partnership signals, search volume shifts, and technology stack
      changes into 2–3 page executive summaries.
    - >-
      Continuous monitoring and alerts for new entrants, pricing changes,
      feature launches, and M&A with configurable frequency
      (daily/weekly/monthly).
    - >-
      Collaboration: shared projects, reviewer workflows, redlines, and approval
      checklists aligned to consulting QA standards.
    - >-
      API and data connectors (e.g., Crunchbase, Similarweb, G2/Capterra,
      BuiltWith) plus custom ingestion of client PDFs and data rooms subject to
      licensing/compliance.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA option for high-stakes deliverables (SLA within 24–72
      hours).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Client-ready competitor matrices, pricing/feature comparisons, and trend
    briefs in under 60 minutes with verifiable citations, PPT/Excel exports, and
    continuous monitoring—cutting research time by 70%+ and improving
    deliverable quality and consistency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Audit-grade, consulting-native outputs with standardized taxonomies,
    time-stamped citations, and slide-ready exports—backed by a proprietary
    knowledge graph and embedded QA workflows that reduce rework. Early
    partnerships with key data providers and a growing template library create
    switching costs and faster time-to-value vs. generic AI research tools.
