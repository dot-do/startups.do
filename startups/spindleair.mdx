  problem:
    - >-
      Electricity is 8–15% of yarn/thread cost; mills lack line- and
      product-level visibility (kWh/kg by yarn count, blend, and machine),
      making systematic reduction hard.
    - >-
      Compressed air typically consumes 15–25% of mill electricity; 20–35% of
      compressed air is lost to leaks and poor control, but leaks are found
      infrequently and not quantified in $/year.
    - >-
      Time-of-use tariffs vary 20–40% between peak/off-peak, yet production
      plans rarely optimize for tariff windows, causing avoidable demand peaks
      and penalties.
    - >-
      Existing EMS/SCADA provide data but not mill-specific guidance (e.g.,
      spindle occupancy vs. compressor load, ring vs. rotor baselines, winding
      recipe impacts).
    - >-
      Energy projects stall due to weak M&V and unclear ROI; leadership needs
      verified savings, not dashboards. Maintenance teams need prioritized,
      actionable work orders, not generic alerts.
  solution:
    - >-
      Rapid deployment: plug-and-play edge gateway integrates with SCADA/PLC
      (Modbus, OPC-UA) to ingest power, compressor, and machine data; optional
      meters/flow sensors added where gaps exist.
    - >-
      AI baselining per machine and product: learn normal kWh/kg and air demand
      by yarn count, blend, traveler, winding recipe, humidity and shift;
      normalize for production mix and ambient.
    - >-
      Real-time anomaly detection: flag deviations >10% from baseline,
      compressor specific power deterioration, pressure instabilities, and
      unusual night/weekend flow indicating leaks.
    - >-
      Compressed air leak management: quantify baseline leak rate via off-shift
      decay/flow; produce ranked leak list ($/yr, kWh/yr) and integrate with
      mobile tagging/repair workflow; verify post-repair savings.
    - >-
      Off-peak and demand optimization: recommend shift and batch schedules that
      move winding/drying and spool-heavy operations into off-peak windows and
      shave peaks; simulate tariff impacts before approval.
    - >-
      Actionable work orders: auto-generate prioritized tasks (e.g., ‘Reduce
      ring frame pressure from 6.8 to 6.2 bar’ or ‘Repair valve at header 3 –
      est. $14,200/yr’), route to CMMS, and track MTTR/closure.
    - >-
      M&V and reporting: IPMVP Option C with weather/production normalization;
      provide verified savings, CO2e reduction, and ISO 50001-ready reports
      monthly.
    - >-
      Continuous improvement: benchmark vs. similar mills (anonymous), highlight
      best-practice setpoints, and forecast ROI of upgrades (VSD compressor,
      heat recovery, nozzle retrofits).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce 8–15% mill electricity within 90 days by making energy and compressed
    air visible at the product and machine level (kWh/kg, kWh/spindle,
    kW/(m3/min)), continuously detecting leaks and off-nominal operation, and
    auto-recommending off-peak schedules—backed by M&V-grade savings
    verification and payback <6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A purpose-built dataset and model library for spinning and winding (kWh/kg
    by yarn count, machine fingerprints for major OEMs), combined with
    compressor analytics and tariff-aware scheduling in one platform, plus
    IPMVP-grade M&V and prebuilt integrations that reduce deployment time to
    weeks—not months. Partner routes through compressor and textile OEMs create
    defensible distribution and data access.
