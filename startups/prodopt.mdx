  problem:
    - >-
      Manual/Excel scheduling and generic ERP sequencing cannot handle
      multi-stage, multi-resource constraints (coil winding, core stacking,
      assembly, tanking, FAT/test) leading to 10–25% schedule infeasibility and
      firefighting.
    - >-
      On-time delivery (OTD) in transformer plants often sits at 70–85% due to
      test-bay bottlenecks, shared cranes, curing/soak times, and
      material/skills constraints not modeled in current tools.
    - >-
      Long cycle times (8–20 weeks for power; 1–6 weeks for distribution) cause
      high WIP (1.5–3.0x daily throughput) and cash tied up; rescheduling after
      disruptions takes 2–8 hours per planner and happens 3–5 times/week.
    - >-
      Changeovers (e.g., copper gauge, winding program, core steel grade) and
      limited skilled labor (winder/test technicians) are not optimized, causing
      5–15% capacity loss.
    - >-
      ERP/MRP plans are infinite-capacity and ignore finite resources (test
      bays, ovens, VPI tanks, paint booths, cranes), producing release plans
      that are impossible to execute on the shop floor.
    - >-
      Quality holds/rework, maintenance windows, and HSE constraints (e.g., oil
      handling, HV test) force frequent plan breaks; lack of scenario planning
      leads to costly expediting and premium freight.
    - >-
      Visibility gaps between ERP/MES and shop floor dispatch lists result in
      poor plan adherence (<70%), high expediting hours, and schedule
      instability (daily plan churn >30%).
  solution:
    - >-
      Transformer-specific optimization engine combining constraint programming
      (CP-SAT/MIP) with heuristics for long-cycle, multi-resource jobs (cells,
      bays, cranes, ovens, skills, materials).
    - >-
      Multi-objective optimizer minimizing weighted tardiness, changeovers, WIP,
      and setup/teardown, with service-level and priority classes per
      order/customer.
    - >-
      Real-time rescheduling and what-if scenarios for rush orders, machine
      downtime, material delays, and rework with 1–5 minute solver runtimes for
      typical horizons (2–12 weeks).
    - >-
      Built-in constraint templates: copper gauge/winding program changeovers,
      core steel grade/lamination sequence, VPI and curing times, oil
      fill/degassing, tanking-bay occupancy, shared crane conflicts, HV test
      availability, paint/oven capacity, shift/skills calendars, maintenance
      windows, HSE rules.
    - >-
      Tight integrations with ERP/MES (SAP PP/PM/MM, Oracle, Infor LN, Siemens
      Opcenter, Rockwell), PLM/BOMs, and shop-floor data (downtime, quality
      holds) via prebuilt connectors and APIs.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly Gantt views, dispatch lists by cell, electronic traveler
      updates, and plan adherence tracking; alerts for late risk and constraint
      violations.
    - >-
      KPI dashboards for OTD, cycle time, WIP, resource utilization,
      changeovers, expediting hours/costs; export to Power BI/Tableau.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure SaaS (Azure/AWS, SOC2-ready) or private cloud;
      IT-friendly with SSO, RBAC, audit logs, and data residency controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Feasible, explainable, AI-driven finite-capacity schedules across winding,
    core, assembly, tanking, and test in minutes—not days—lifting OTD by 10–20
    points, reducing WIP by 15–30%, and increasing test-bay utilization by 10–15
    points within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Transformer-specific scheduling IP (constraint templates for test bays,
    crane conflicts, VPI/curing, oil/tanking) plus prebuilt ERP/MES connectors
    deliver 8–12 week time-to-value; hybrid OR + heuristics tuned on real
    transformer plants provide explainable, stable schedules that planners
    trust—difficult for generic APS or in-house tools to replicate quickly.
