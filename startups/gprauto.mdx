  problem:
    - >-
      Manual GPR interpretation is slow (4–8 hours per typical urban block or
      10–20 hours per lane-mile) and highly variable across technicians,
      creating backlogs and scheduling risk.
    - >-
      Hyperbola detection and layer picking depend on scarce expert talent;
      firms struggle to scale during peak demand or multi-state DOT projects.
    - >-
      Inconsistent depth calibration (dielectric estimation/time-zero) leads to
      10–30% depth error and avoidable rework or potholing overruns.
    - >-
      Deliverables are fragmented; converting radargrams to CAD/GIS/3D utility
      polylines and surfaces is error-prone, delaying ASCE 38-22 compliant
      submittals.
    - >-
      Vendor-specific silos (GSSI, IDS GeoRadar, Malå, Sensors & Software)
      complicate cross-hardware workflows, training, and QC.
    - >-
      Clients (SUE firms, DOTs, owners) demand faster turnarounds (<5 business
      days), tighter accuracy (±0.1–0.2 ft where feasible), and traceable QA/QC
      audit trails, which current tools don’t streamline.
  solution:
    - >-
      Cloud and on-prem AI engine for automatic hyperbola detection with
      confidence scoring and 3D polyline extraction.
    - >-
      AI-assisted layer picking (e.g., pavement/base/subgrade) with mean
      absolute layer error targets <3 cm and per-segment uncertainty.
    - >-
      Automated time-zero and dielectric estimation leveraging known targets and
      user-verified pothole depths to reduce depth error to <10%.
    - >-
      Batch processing pipelines handling heterogeneous vendor formats;
      project-level QC dashboards with audit logs and versioning.
    - >-
      One-click deliverables: CAD (DWG/DXF), GIS (Shapefile/GeoPackage/GeoJSON),
      LandXML, IFC, and ArcGIS feature classes mapped to ASCE 38-22 schema.
    - >-
      APIs and plugins for ArcGIS Pro, AutoCAD Civil 3D, and Bentley OpenRoads
      to keep data in the client’s native environment.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10x faster, hardware-agnostic GPR processing that automatically detects
    utilities and layers, calibrates depths, and outputs ASCE-compliant CAD/GIS
    deliverables with auditable QA—cutting turnaround from days to hours while
    improving accuracy and consistency.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Closed-loop learning from user corrections and verified pothole data builds
    a proprietary, diverse dataset and calibration models that generalize across
    vendors and environments; combined with OEM/CAD ecosystem integrations and
    SOC 2-backed auditability, this creates high switching costs and a
    defensible accuracy/throughput lead.

      processing across offices.
    - >-

    Utility locators, surveyors, and civil engineers who need fast, defensible
    subsurface utility maps from GPR data.
  problem: >-
    Manual GPR processing is slow and inconsistent—noisy data, missed
    hyperbolas, and tedious layer picking delay projects and raise the risk of
    strikes, rework, and non-compliance.
  guide: >-
    We’re geophysics and GIS practitioners with an AI-assisted GPR workflow; we
    understand field pressures and QC, and we deliver transparent, reviewable
    results that plug into your CAD/GIS.

    Upload GPR and positioning files; AI detects hyperbolas, picks layers, and
    flags utilities; you QA/QC in a web viewer; export CAD/GIS deliverables
    (DWG, SHP, GeoJSON) and reports aligned with ASCE 38/75.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a pilot by uploading a sample dataset or book a 20-minute demo to see
    your data auto-processed and ready for CAD today.
  success: >-
    Deliver consistent, auditable maps faster, reduce field risk, win more bids
    with the same team, and hand over CAD/GIS outputs clients trust.
  failure: >-
