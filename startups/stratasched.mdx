  problem:
    - >-
      OTIF (on-time, in-full) misses of 5–15 percentage points due to
      maintenance shutdowns and sales priorities colliding with limited crews
      and plant capacity.
    - >-
      Excess overtime (10–30% above plan) and expensive weekend shifts caused by
      reactive rescheduling.
    - >-
      Frequent stockouts on key size fractions while overproducing low-demand
      SKUs, creating yard congestion and cash tied in inventory.
    - >-
      Unplanned downtime and lost throughput when maintenance windows are
      skipped or poorly sequenced with production.
    - >-
      Truck/rail loading bottlenecks and demurrage fees from misaligned
      production vs. loadout capacity and carrier windows.
    - >-
      Manual planning in spreadsheets and whiteboards takes 6–12 hours weekly
      per site; plan quality depends on a single expert; limited what-if
      analysis.
    - >-
      Poor visibility of true constraints (crusher/screening line rates, wash
      plant, conveyors, loaders, mobile equipment, crew certifications,
      weather).
  solution:
    - >-
      Constraint-based weekly scheduling that jointly optimizes production runs,
      maintenance windows, crews, and loadout against confirmed orders and
      forecast.
    - >-
      Data integrations to pull orders/forecast (ERP), maintenance plans (CMMS),
      equipment availability (telematics), and inventory/yard levels
      (scale-house/stockpile systems).
    - >-
      Scenario planning to test outages, weather impacts, rush orders, and
      contractor availability; side-by-side KPI comparison.
    - >-
      Closed-loop execution: publish to dispatch/loadout, capture actuals, and
      auto-reconcile variances; weekly continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Operator-friendly UI with Gantt views, constraint explanations, and simple
      manual overrides with instant feasibility checks.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    A single feasible weekly schedule that maximizes OTIF and throughput while
    honoring maintenance, crews, and plant limits—generated in minutes,
    continuously optimized with real data. Typical outcomes: +5–10 OTIF points,
    −10–20% overtime, −20–40% demurrage/expedites, >95% planned maintenance
    compliance, and −70% planner time to produce the schedule.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A quarry-specific constraint library and solver heuristics proven in pilot
    sites, plus prebuilt connectors to common CMMS/ERP/scale systems deliver
    fast time-to-value (<30 days). We retain anonymized performance benchmarks
    to calibrate realistic constraints and predict ROI, reducing pilot risk and
    improving solve quality versus generic APS tools.

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Quarry, plant, and dispatch managers in crushed and broken stone who need a
    reliable weekly plan that ships every order while protecting equipment and
    crews.
  problem: >-
    External — Volatile orders, crusher/screen bottlenecks, maintenance shuts,
    crew limits, and truck slots make spreadsheets fail. Internal — Firefighting
    and finger‑pointing erode trust between sales, plant, and maintenance.
    Philosophical — Scheduling rock should run on real constraints and data, not
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    Empathy — We understand the chaos of matching blends, circuits, and loader
    limits to shifting demand. Authority — Our AI models your crushers, screens,
    stockpiles, haul fleet, crews, and CMMS windows to produce an achievable
    weekly plan, auto‑replanned as conditions change.
  plan: >-
    1) Assess & connect: Map constraints, orders, blends; integrate ERP, CMMS,
    scales, telematics. 2) Pilot fast: 2‑week sandbox with your data; validate
    on‑time, uptime, and overtime. 3) Go live: Weekly optimization with daily
    replans, clear exceptions, what‑ifs, and a frozen horizon everyone trusts.
  callToAction: Schedule a 30‑minute demo and start a 30‑day pilot.
  success: >-
    On‑time shipments and reliable promise dates; protected maintenance windows;
    higher utilization with fewer changeovers; less overtime and rehandling;
    right loader/truck sequencing; one shared schedule for sales, plant, and
    maintenance.
  failure: >-
    Stick with spreadsheets and gut feel: missed loads, hot‑shot costs,
    preventable breakdowns, overtime, frustrated customers, and burned‑out
    crews.
