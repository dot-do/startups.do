  problem:
    - >-
      Manual compliance reviews of elevator/escalator design packages are slow
      (often 2–6 weeks) and error-prone due to thousands of clauses across
      A17.1/CSA B44 and EN 81-20/50.
    - >-
      Late-stage findings from Notified Bodies/AHJs cause costly rework,
      schedule slips (1–8 weeks), and material changes (doors, controllers,
      safety gear).
    - >-
      Engineering teams struggle to keep up with frequent standard revisions,
      interpretations, and regional deviations (e.g., state/provincial adoption
      timing).
    - >-
      Inconsistent and undocumented rule interpretation across teams leads to
      internal disputes, audit risk, and training burden for new engineers.
    - >-
      Siloed tools (CAD, PLM, BOM, test procedures) make cross-document checks
      and traceability to clauses tedious and non-repeatable.
    - >-
      Suppliers’ component data sheets often lack sufficient compliance
      evidence, forcing OEM engineers to chase documentation or over-design.
  solution:
    - >-
      Hybrid rule engine + LLM that parses design packages (CAD drawings, BOMs,
      control schematics, test plans, maintenance manuals) to flag probable
      nonconformities with clause-linked evidence.
    - >-
      Pre-built, peer-reviewed rule libraries for A17.1/CSA B44 and EN 81-20/50
      with regional addenda; configurable interpretations aligned to customer
      policy and project jurisdiction.
    - >-
      Design-time plug-ins/connectors for PLM/CAD (Teamcenter,
      3DEXPERIENCE/ENOVIA, Windchill, SolidWorks, AutoCAD Electrical/EPLAN) to
      run checks inside authoring tools.
    - >-
      Automated traceability matrix that maps items to clauses, shows pass/fail
      rationale, and compiles evidence packs for Notified Body submissions.
    - >-
      Change impact analysis for new standard revisions; highlights affected
      designs/components and generates update tasks.
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop workflow: engineers review flags, accept/override with
      rationale; system learns from decisions and institutionalizes
      interpretations.
    - >-
      Security-first deployments: customer VPC or on-prem; no standards text
      redistribution—only clause IDs/metadata; full audit logs and role-based
      access.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce elevator/escalator compliance review time by 30–50% and late-stage
    NCRs by 20–40% with an auditable, continuously updated rule/LLM assistant
    that validates designs against A17.1/CSA B44 and EN 81-20/50 across CAD,
    BOM, and documentation before submission.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Codified, peer-reviewed rules validated with ex-standards committee members
    plus a growing proprietary dataset of elevator/escalator design packages and
    NCR outcomes, embedded directly in OEM PLM/CAD workflows—creating switching
    costs and trust that generic AI/regtech tools lack.

    Elevator and moving stairway design and compliance teams who need to ship
    conforming products faster without missing critical code requirements
  problem: >-
    Manual compliance reviews against ASME A17.1 CSA B44 and EN 81-20 50 are
    slow and error prone. Teams feel constant pressure and risk late findings,
    rework, and delays, even though safety critical products deserve clear and
    reliable compliance from the start
  guide: >-
    We have lived code reviews and audits. Built with elevator compliance
    experts, the assistant combines a rules engine and LLM to flag probable
    nonconformities with clause citations and explanations, mapped to ASME A17.1
    CSA B44 and EN 81-20 50. Secure by design and available on-prem or private
    cloud. Augments, not replaces, human judgment
  plan: >-
    1 Upload or connect your design package drawings specs BOM and calculations.
    2 The assistant pre-checks against targeted standards and highlights likely
    nonconformities with cited clauses and rationale. 3 Your engineer reviews,
    resolves, and exports a traceable checklist and report or integrates
    findings into PLM QA workflow
  callToAction: Start a 2 week pilot with sample design packages or book a 30 minute demo
  success: >-
    Cut pre-check time by 60 percent or more, reduce late NCRs, improve first
    pass approvals, capture tribal knowledge, and provide audit ready
    traceability for faster certification and fewer surprises
  failure: >-
    Without it you face surprise findings during certification, costly
    redesigns, shipment delays, potential noncompliance penalties, increased
    safety risk exposure, and erosion of customer trust
