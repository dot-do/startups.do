  problem:
    - >-
      High manual effort: 45–90 minutes per contract to read, extract terms, and
      input into trackers/CTRM; mid-size merchants process 300–2,000
      contracts/year, consuming 225–3,000 staff hours.
    - >-
      Missed obligations: 1–3% of contracts lead to penalties, demurrage, or
      price adjustments due to missed shipment windows, wrong Incoterms
      interpretation, or tolerance/spec misalignment.
    - >-
      Fragmented tracking: Obligations spread across email, spreadsheets, and
      CTRM notes; poor visibility of back-to-back buy/sell alignment increases
      basis and logistics risk.
    - >-
      Inconsistent data quality: Specs, tolerances, quality grades, and penalty
      clauses vary by counterparty and language; copy/paste errors propagate to
      downstream systems.
    - >-
      Limited auditability: Hard to prove compliance during disputes or audits;
      incomplete version control and acceptance records.
    - >-
      Slow onboarding: New ops/logistics staff take months to learn clause
      nuances (e.g., FOB vs CFR responsibilities, allowed shipment windows by
      port).
  solution:
    - >-
      Multi-channel ingestion: email ingestion, drag-and-drop, SFTP, and API for
      PDFs, scans, Word, and image-based contracts.
    - >-
      Domain-tuned extraction: models trained on ag-merchant contracts to
      capture Incoterms, shipment/delivery windows, quantity and tolerance,
      quality specs/grades, price formula/index references, payment terms,
      penalties/demurrage rules, laytime/despatch, documentation requirements,
      and governing law/arbitration.
    - >-
      Back-to-back mapping: link buy and sell contracts for the same lot; flag
      misalignments (e.g., tighter sell tolerance than buy, mismatched windows
      or ports).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop review: side-by-side contract view with highlighted
      fields; one-click approve/edit to hit 98%+ validated accuracy; learning
      loop improves per-counterparty.
    - >-
      Obligation tracker: auto-creates tasks, deadlines, and owners;
      escalations, calendar sync (Outlook/G Suite), and alerting (email/Slack/MS
      Teams).
    - >-
      Integrations: CTRM (Eka, Agiblocks, iRely, Brady), ERP (SAP, Microsoft
      Dynamics 365), e-signature (DocuSign), storage (SharePoint/Box), BI (Power
      BI/Tableau).
    - >-
      Audit and version control: immutable activity log, clause lineage, version
      diffs, acceptance timestamps, and exportable audit packs for disputes.
    - >-
      Security and compliance: SOC 2 roadmap, SSO/SAML, role-based access, data
      residency options, encryption in transit/at rest.
    - >-
      Multilingual support: EN/ES/PT/FR at launch; terminology packs for
      commodity-specific specs (e.g., wool grades, hide selections).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Purpose-built AI that extracts Incoterms, shipment windows, specs,
    tolerances, penalties, and price formulas from ag-merchant contracts and
    turns them into tracked obligations with alerts, tasks, and CTRM/ERP
    sync—cutting contract processing time by 60–80% and reducing
    missed-obligation penalties by 30–60% within 6 months.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Domain-tuned models and counterparty-specific clause libraries learned from
    ag-merchant contracts; back-to-back buy/sell mismatch detection tightly
    integrated with CTRM workflows; growing network effect as more
    counterparties’ clause patterns are captured, raising accuracy and switching
    costs; rapid ROI proof from pilot methodology and prebuilt CTRM connectors.
