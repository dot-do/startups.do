  problem:
    - >-
      Footwear e-commerce return rates are 20–35%, with ~60% attributed to poor
      fit/sizing, eroding margins and inventory turns.
    - >-
      Inconsistent sizing across brands, regions (US/EU/UK/CM), and widths
      (N/M/W/EE) causes customer confusion and reduces conversion.
    - >-
      Product detail pages lack interactive guidance; shoppers abandon when
      uncertain about size/fit, especially for first-time brand buyers.
    - >-
      Customer service teams spend disproportionate time on size inquiries,
      inflating support costs and slowing response times.
    - >-
      Retailers underuse returns/exchange data that could improve
      recommendations and reduce repeat mis-sizing.
    - >-
      Mobile shoppers need fast, conversational guidance; static size charts are
      slow to read and poorly formatted on small screens.
    - >-
      Retailers lack a measurable, low-friction way to A/B test size guidance
      impact on conversion and returns.
  solution:
    - >-
      On-site/chat widget on PDP and cart that asks 3–6 targeted questions (foot
      length/width, usual size in known brands, sock thickness, use case) and
      recommends a size and fit note (e.g., runs small, consider wide).
    - >-
      Ingest and normalize brand size charts and width/last data; automatically
      reconcile US/EU/UK/CM sizing and half sizes.
    - >-
      Leverage historical returns/exchanges and order outcomes to continuously
      refine fit models by SKU and cohort (e.g., first-time buyers vs repeat).
    - >-
      Cross-brand size graph: map user’s known good sizes (e.g., Nike Pegasus
      10.5) to retailer SKUs in other brands.
    - >-
      Escalate complex cases or edge sizes to human agents via
      Zendesk/Gorgias/Intercom with full context; capture agent resolution for
      learning.
    - >-
      Analytics dashboard quantifying conversion uplift, return-rate deltas,
      assisted revenue, containment rate, and ROI.
    - >-
      A/B and multivariate testing controls to compare assistant vs. size chart
      baseline by traffic segment and device.
    - >-
      Optional in-store mode: QR/kiosk experience for associates to quickly
      recommend sizes, sync with OMS for BOPIS/ship-from-store.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce returns and boost conversion with a conversational, data-driven size
    and fit assistant that learns from your brand’s size charts,
    returns/exchanges, and customer feedback—providing accurate, explainable
    recommendations and seamless human handoff when needed.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously improving, proprietary cross-brand fit graph built from
    aggregated, anonymized post-purchase outcomes (returns/exchanges/CS notes)
    across multiple retailers—enabling accurate, explainable, and brand-agnostic
    size recommendations that competitors without multi-retailer data cannot
    match. Reinforced by tight platform partnerships and experimentation tooling
    that proves ROI quickly.
  customerSegments:
