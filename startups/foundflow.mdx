  problem:
    - >-
      Lost items generate 10–30 support tickets per 100k trips; manual
      triage/matching takes 10–20 minutes per case and costs $7–$15 in agent
      time.
    - >-
      Drivers are contacted ad-hoc; response rates and pickup coordination are
      inconsistent, delaying returns and lowering CSAT/NPS.
    - >-
      Riders lack visibility; poor communication increases repeat contacts
      (1.6–2.3 follow-ups per case).
    - >-
      Fragmented tooling (email, spreadsheets, CRM) yields weak audit trails,
      fraud exposure, and noncompliance with local lost property regulations.
    - >-
      Dispatch vendors’ built-in L&F modules are basic; they don’t use ML/NLP to
      match trip metadata, resulting in low hit rates and high manual workload.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest rider reports via embedded web/mobile forms, IVR/SMS, or API;
      normalize and enrich with trip metadata (time, route, pickup/dropoff,
      driver, vehicle).
    - >-
      Apply NLP and probabilistic matching to map descriptions to likely
      trips/drivers; generate top-3 candidates with confidence scores within
      minutes.
    - >-
      Automate driver outreach (in-app push, SMS, WhatsApp) with structured
      prompts to confirm item presence; capture photo proof and location
      securely.
    - >-
      Coordinate returns: schedule meetups, generate pre-paid shipping labels,
      or dispatch couriers; handle payments/tips/fees with escrow and receipts.
    - >-
      Provide an operations console with SLA timers, fraud scoring, audit
      trails, and analytics; feed status updates to riders via preferred
      channels.
    - >-
      Integrate with dispatch, CRM, and comms stacks; comply with data
      minimization, retention, and SOC 2 controls.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce lost-item handling costs by 40–60% and return items 2–3x faster
    through AI-powered trip matching, automated driver coordination, and
    integrated return logistics—delivered as a compliant, white-label workflow
    that plugs into existing dispatch and CRM tools.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Deep dispatch and driver-app integrations plus a growing cross-fleet dataset
    that improves match precision over time; combined with standardized SOPs,
    compliance posture, and logistics partnerships that are hard to replicate
    quickly.
  customerSegments:

storyBrand:
  character: >-
    Operations and customer support leaders at taxi and rideshare companies who
    want lost items returned fast with minimal driver disruption and lower
    support costs.
  problem: >-
    - External: Manual matching, driver coordination, and return logistics drain
    time and miss items.

    - Internal: Riders worry and lose trust; agents are swamped; drivers feel
    hassled.

    - Philosophical: People should get their belongings back quickly, safely,
    and fairly.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the chaos of lost-and-found at scale and the
    pressure to keep riders and drivers happy.

    - Authority: Built by mobility and AI practitioners; secure, privacy-first
    workflows with clear SLAs and auditability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect trip, driver, and messaging data via API/webhooks.

    2) Enable AI matching to link reports to likely trips/drivers with
    confidence scores.

    3) Automate outreach, scheduling, and fee/payment handling; choose driver
    drop-off or courier.

    4) Track every case and KPI in a shared dashboard; tune rules, SLAs, and
    notifications.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a 20-minute demo to see automated matching and returns in
    action.

    - Transitional: Run a low-risk pilot using recent trip data and measure case
    resolution time and cost.
  success: |-
    - Faster recoveries and happier riders.
    - Fewer tickets and lower handling costs.
    - Drivers spend less time on lost-and-found, more on rides.
    - Clear status, audit trails, and policy compliance.
    - Stronger brand trust and CSAT.
  failure: |-
    - Tickets pile up and items go unrecovered.
    - Agents burn time; drivers disengage.
    - Refunds, chargebacks, and policy escalations rise.
    - Riders switch to competitors and leave poor reviews.
