leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual review of track inspection logs for FRA Part 213 compliance is slow
      (5–15 minutes/report), error‑prone, and inconsistent across inspectors and
      contractors.
    - >-
      Railroads and maintenance contractors face rising audit exposure as Part
      213 interpretations vary by track class, environment, and latest
      amendments; maintaining up‑to‑date rulebooks and training at scale is
      costly.
    - >-
      Inspection data is fragmented (paper, PDFs, spreadsheets, EAM/CMMS
      entries) and not machine‑readable; this delays defect triage and work
      order initiation by 1–3 days.
    - >-
      Lack of an auditable chain‑of‑evidence (who reviewed what, when, and why)
      complicates responses to FRA inquiries and increases risk of fines or slow
      orders.
    - >-
      Work order drafting from defects is manual and repetitive; critical
      defects may miss prescribed remedial timelines in §213, increasing safety
      risk and operational cost (slow orders, reroutes).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI parsing pipeline ingests PDFs, photos, forms, and EAM/CMMS exports;
      normalizes to a structured schema (segment, milepost, class, geometry,
      component findings, inspector).
    - >-
      Deterministic rules engine encoded from FRA Part 213 (including §213.9
      remedial actions, §213.113 defective rails, §213.119 continuous welded
      rail, §213.233 inspection frequency) with track‑class context and
      environmental modifiers.
    - >-
      LLM‑assisted reasoning to resolve ambiguous entries, recommend defect
      codes, and map free‑text notes to standardized defect taxonomies.
    - >-
      Automated remedial action drafting with required timelines, speed
      restrictions, and work scopes; push to EAM/CMMS (SAP, Maximo) as work
      orders with parts/labor templates.
    - >-
      Audit trail and evidence locker: rule citations, decision explanations,
      reviewer sign‑off, timestamps, GPS/segment mapping, and versioned rulebook
      snapshots for audits.
    - >-
      Dashboards for compliance status, overdue remediations, defect hotspots by
      corridor, and inspector benchmarking.
    - >-
      Change management engine to update rules within 15 business days of FRA
      amendments; release notes and delta tests ensure continuity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automate FRA Part 213 validation end‑to‑end: parse any inspection log, apply
    current §213 rules by track class, flag defects with citations, and
    auto‑draft remedial actions/work orders—cutting review time 60–80%, reducing
    citation risk by 50%+, and producing audit‑ready documentation instantly.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A continuously updated, machine‑readable Part 213 rules engine linked to an
    audited change log and a proprietary, growing corpus of labeled inspection
    reports across multiple operators—yielding superior validation accuracy,
    faster rule updates, and explainable decisions that stand up in audits.
    Early integrations with leading EAM/CMMS and GIS platforms deepen switching
    costs.

    networks safe and audit‑ready under FRA Part 213.
  problem: >-
    - External: Disparate inspection logs and manual rule checks make it easy to
    miss defects, deadlines, and class limits.

    - Internal: Teams worry they’ll overlook a 213 exception or misclassify a
    defect before an audit.

    - Philosophical: Safety and compliance shouldn’t depend on spreadsheets and
    guesswork.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We understand the pressure of time‑bounded inspections,
    corrective windows, and audit scrutiny.
