leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      8–15% of provisioning service orders fall out due to data mismatches (MACD
      errors, address/LSR/ASR issues), inventory conflicts, vendor rejections,
      and orchestration failures.
    - >-
      Mean time to resolve (MTTR) for fallout is hours to days, driving OPEX and
      missed install SLAs.
    - >-
      High manual handling: 3–8 human touches per fallout case, costing $25–$150
      per event depending on product complexity (residential vs. enterprise).
    - >-
      Revenue leakage from delayed activations, order cancellations, and truck
      rolls caused by missed due dates and poor jeopardy management.
    - >-
      Brittle rule-based scripts and siloed OSS/BSS stacks
      (Amdocs/Netcracker/Oracle OSM + ServiceNow) limit automation and
      adaptability to new products and partners.
    - >-
      Limited auditability and compliance pressure (ASOG/LSR standards, TM Forum
      conformance, customer data handling) increase risk and rework.
  solution:
    - >-
      Ingest and classify order fallout in real time from order management,
      orchestration, and ticketing queues (e.g., Oracle OSM/COM, Amdocs,
      Netcracker, ServiceNow).
    - >-
      Root‑cause taxonomy tuned to ASOG/LSR/ASR and common telco error classes;
      ML models map errors to playbooks with confidence scoring and
      explainability.
    - >-
      Auto‑fix engine executes pre‑approved playbooks (e.g., address
      normalization, inventory re‑sync, product catalog correction, partner
      order reformat, re‑orchestration step) with policy and SLA guardrails.
    - >-
      Automated re‑submission or controlled escalation to the right queue
      (Tier-2/vendor) with enriched context and proposed next best action.
    - >-
      Human‑in‑the‑loop console for review/approval of low‑confidence cases;
      continuous learning from operator feedback.
    - >-
      Order simulation/sandbox to validate remediation steps against a digital
      twin before execution to prevent re‑fallout.
    - >-
      Analytics and ROI dashboards: fallout rate, MTTR, auto‑fix success,
      touches/order, SLA jeopardy risk, and revenue-at-risk avoided.
    - >-
      Secure deployment options: SaaS, private cloud, or on‑prem; SOC 2/ISO
      27001 alignment; full audit trail and RBAC.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Reduce provisioning fallout backlog by 30–50% and MTTR by 50–70% in 90 days
    with a closed‑loop AI that classifies root cause, auto‑fixes safely with
    guardrails, and re‑submits or escalates across your OSS—improving on‑time
    installs 1.5–3 pts and cutting OPEX materially.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A cross‑carrier fallout taxonomy and pre‑trained models/playbooks specific
    to wired provisioning (LSR/ASR, catalog/inventory, activation), plus
    certified adapters to top OSS/ITSM stacks. Closed‑loop automation with safe
    simulation and guardrails enables true auto‑fix (not just detection),
    delivering rapid, verifiable ROI and lowering change risk. Early
    design‑partner results and benchmark library accelerate sales and
    deployment.

  character: >-
    Service Delivery and Provisioning leaders at wired telecommunications
    carriers (NAICS 517111) responsible for on-time installs, change orders, and
    SLA adherence at scale.
  problem: >-
    Provisioning orders fall out across OSS/BSS handoffs (design, assign,
    activate), creating backlogs, manual rework, missed SLAs, revenue leakage,
    and poor customer experience—while teams lack clear root cause and
    standardized fixes.
  guide: >-
    We are telecom OSS veterans and applied-AI experts who’ve processed millions
    of carrier service orders. We understand codes, workflows, and compliance,
    and provide a secure AI that classifies fallout, prescribes fixes, and acts
    automatically—keeping humans in control with full auditability.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect data and map flows (order feeds, status codes, APIs); 2) Run a
    30-day pilot on historical and live orders to tune classifiers and auto-fix
    playbooks; 3) Go live with guardrails, dashboards, and continuous learning
    to auto-resubmit or smartly escalate.
  callToAction: >-
    Start a 30-day pilot today; or schedule a 30-minute demo to see your fallout
    patterns and fix playbooks.
  success: >-
    Reduce fallout and MTTR by 40–70%, accelerate revenue recognition, meet
    SLAs, cut OPEX from manual rework, boost first-time-right rates and customer
    satisfaction, with proactive visibility and auditable fixes.
  failure: >-
    Remain stuck in order fallout, swivel-chair rework, missed install dates,
    compliance exposure, revenue leakage, and churn as backlogs grow.

  problem:
    - >-
      Order fallout drives missed install dates, SLA penalties, and trapped
      revenue.
    - Manual triage across OSS/BSS and vendor portals consumes costly ops time.
    - Inconsistent jeopardy codes and incomplete data slow root-cause analysis.
    - Resubmission loops and rework delay FOC and service turn-up.
    - 'Escalations lack clear ownership, context, and audit-ready evidence.'
    - Limited visibility into recurring issues and vendor performance trends.
  solution:
    - Real-time detection of order fallout across the provisioning lifecycle.
    - Auto-classification to normalized reason codes for consistent handling.
    - Suggested and automated fixes via guardrailed playbooks.
    - >-
      Validated auto-resubmission when criteria are met; otherwise one-click
      resubmit.
    - Smart escalations with structured evidence packs and timelines.
    - Closed-loop learning improves accuracy and time-to-restore.
    - 'Live dashboards for SLA risk, revenue-at-risk, and bottlenecks.'
  features:
    - 'Connectors for OMS/OSS/BSS, LSR/ASR, emails, and carrier portals.'
    - Telecom-tuned ML models for jeopardy and error classification.
    - No-code policy engine to define product- and region-specific actions.
    - 'Guardrails: simulate, approvals, rollback, and rate limits.'
    - End-to-end audit trail with explainable decisions and confidence scores.
    - >-
      API/webhook integration with ServiceNow, Netcracker, Amdocs, CSG,
      Salesforce.
    - 'Deployment options: private cloud, VPC, or on-prem.'
    - >-
      Enterprise security: SSO (SAML/OIDC), RBAC, encryption at rest and in
      transit.
    - 'KPI tracking: MTTR, first-pass yield, SLA attainment, and rework rate.'
  steps:
    - 'Connect data sources: order bus, ticketing, vendor feeds, data lake.'
    - Import 6–12 months of history to train and benchmark.
    - Normalize reason codes; map playbooks by product and market.
    - Run observe mode to validate classifications and fix simulations.
    - Enable auto-fix for low-risk scenarios; set escalation policies.
    - 'Monitor impact, tune playbooks, and expand coverage by line of business.'
