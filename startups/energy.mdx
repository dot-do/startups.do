  problem:
    - >-
      Energy is 15–30% of mill manufacturing cost; steam/power networks are
      managed manually with conservative setpoints, leading to 3–10% avoidable
      fuel/power spend.
    - >-
      Steam header pressures and dryer setpoints are rarely co‑optimized with
      boiler/turbine dispatch, causing steam venting, throttling losses, and
      suboptimal CHP operation.
    - >-
      Frequent grade/speed changes, ambient humidity swings, and raw material
      variability make static control recipes inefficient.
    - >-
      Operators must honor hard constraints (boiler/turbine limits, header
      minimums, hood dew point, sheet moisture/quality), so they favor safety
      margins that increase energy intensity (GJ/ton).
    - >-
      Limited real-time visibility into marginal costs (fuel vs purchased power
      vs opportunity power) prevents economically optimal dispatch.
    - >-
      Existing APC/EMS tools are point solutions, not mill‑wide optimizers; many
      mills lack trusted M&V of savings to justify continuous improvements.
  solution:
    - >-
      Connect to historian/DCS (e.g., AVEVA PI, Valmet DNA, ABB 800xA) to ingest
      steam flows/pressures, boiler/turbine status, dryer can/hood data, sheet
      moisture and machine speed.
    - >-
      Build a hybrid digital twin (first‑principles steam/power + data‑driven
      dryer/moisture models) calibrated to the mill’s configuration and grade
      slate.
    - >-
      Run real‑time constrained optimization (model predictive control and
      economic dispatch) every 30–120 seconds to recommend or automatically
      apply setpoints.
    - >-
      Co‑optimize: header pressures, boiler loads (recovery/biomass/gas),
      turbine valves (extraction/condensing), dryer steam/hood setpoints, and
      makeup/purchased power.
    - >-
      Honor hard constraints: safety interlocks, boiler and turbine envelopes,
      minimum header pressures, dew point margins, sheet moisture targets, motor
      limits, environmental limits.
    - >-
      Provide operator‑facing UI: recommendations with rationale, expected
      savings, constraint sensitivities, and one‑click accept/auto mode; support
      manual override with safe fallback.
    - >-
      Perform continuous M&V: normalized baselines by grade/speed/ambient;
      savings dashboards (GJ/ton, $/ton, tCO2e) with third‑party‑auditable
      methodology.
    - >-
      Deploy securely: on‑prem/edge container with read/write segregation, OPC
      UA/Modbus connectors, ISA/IEC 62443 practices; cloud optional for fleet
      analytics.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
