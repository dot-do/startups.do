leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      RFQs arrive as PDFs, spreadsheets, and emails with inconsistent formats;
      manual extraction of duty points, materials, certifications, and
      accessories takes 30–90 minutes per RFQ.
    - >-
      Sales engineers spend 30–60% of their time copying data between RFQs,
      selection tools, ERP, and Word/Excel quotes, creating a throughput
      bottleneck.
    - >-
      Product selection/configuration errors (wrong fan curve, motor frame,
      enclosure rating, filtration class) cause 5–10% quote rework and margin
      leakage (1–3 pp).
    - >-
      Turnaround times of 2–5 business days lose bids to faster competitors;
      many buyers expect <24–48 hours.
    - >-
      Compliance matrices for AMCA/UL/CE/ATEX/ISO/AHAM are built manually,
      risking omissions that lead to disqualifications or late-cycle changes.
    - >-
      Pricing is fragmented across ERP, supplier quotes, and spreadsheets;
      inconsistent cost updates lead to under- or over-quoting.
    - >-
      Knowledge is tribal; only senior sales engineers confidently map specs to
      catalogs and alternates, constraining scale and succession planning.
    - >-
      Lack of structured data on win/loss, price sensitivity, and feature impact
      prevents pricing optimization and product roadmap insights.
    - >-
      Global RFQs introduce language and unit conversion errors
      (imperial/metric) that consume time and create risk.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI RFQ ingestion extracts structured specs (duty point, CFM/m³/h, SP/Pa,
      efficiency, materials, certifications, sound limits, power, environment)
      from PDFs, emails, XLS, portals.
    - >-
      Domain-specific selection engine matches duty points to catalog curves and
      configurable options; proposes alternates and multi-fan arrays when
      needed.
    - >-
      Real-time pricing engine pulls costs from ERP/PLM/supplier quotes, applies
      price lists, regional factors, and margin rules; recommends optimal price
      bands by segment.
    - >-
      Automated compliance matrix builder maps requirements to AMCA, UL 507/705,
      UL 867/2998, CE/UKCA, ATEX/IECEx, ISO 16890/29463, EN 1822, AHAM AC-1, and
      internal test reports.
    - >-
      Quote composer outputs branded proposals, datasheets, GA drawings
      placeholders, and BOMs; supports multilingual output and imperial/metric
      units.
    - >-
      Workflow with approvals, guardrails, and audit logs; pushes
      opportunities/quotes to CRM and orders to ERP.
    - >-
      Analytics layer tracks time-to-quote, accuracy, win/loss, price
      realization, and engineer productivity.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Vertical AI that turns messy RFQs into configured, priced, and
    compliance-checked quotes for fans, blowers, and air purifiers in hours
    instead of days—reducing errors by >80%, boosting win rate and margin, and
    integrating with your ERP/CPQ and rep network out-of-the-box.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A vertically-trained RFQ parser and selection engine built on a proprietary
    dataset of thousands of fan/purifier RFQs, tied to a domain knowledge graph
    and prebuilt compliance matrices (AMCA/UL/ISO/ATEX/AHAM). Combined with
    ready-made ERP/CPQ connectors and anonymized industry benchmarks for pricing
    and cycle times, this creates a defensible lead over generic RFQ/CPQ tools.

    reliable spec extraction, product configuration, pricing, and compliance.
  plan: >-
    1) Connect RFQ sources and product/pricing data. 2) Configure catalog rules,
    performance curves, and compliance templates. 3) Pilot on real RFQs with
    your approval workflow. 4) Roll out with role-based reviews and e-signature.
    5) Monitor cycle time, hit rate, and margin lift.
