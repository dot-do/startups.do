  problem:
    - >-
      Quality drift (density, compressive strength, cell size) is detected late
      via periodic lab tests, leading to scrap/rework; typical EPS/XPS plants
      report 2–8% off‑spec production monthly.
    - >-
      Root causes are difficult to pinpoint across process (e.g., extruder zone
      temps, steam pressure), material (resin grade, pentane content, recycled
      %), and environment (ambient humidity/temp), causing long troubleshooting
      cycles and MTTR of 2–10 hours.
    - >-
      Data is siloed across PLC/SCADA, MES, LIMS, and spreadsheets; engineers
      spend 20–40% of time manually merging and plotting data rather than
      solving problems.
    - >-
      Seasonal and lot‑to‑lot variations shift “normal” behavior; static control
      limits generate false alarms and operator alert fatigue.
    - >-
      Quality capability (Cp/Cpk) is below target on critical specs; each 0.1
      improvement in Cpk can save tens to hundreds of thousands annually, but
      plants lack continuous, line‑level capability monitoring.
    - >-
      Customer claims and compliance risk (ASTM C578/D1621/D1622/C518, CE
      marking) rise when trends go out of control between audits.
    - >-
      Talent gaps: fewer process experts per line; tribal knowledge isn’t
      codified into systematic, repeatable guidance.
  solution:
    - >-
      Unified data ingestion from PLC/SCADA (e.g., Ignition, FactoryTalk),
      historians (AVEVA PI), MES/LIMS, and lab instruments; harmonized
      time-series with product/order context.
    - >-
      Adaptive SPC and change‑point detection (EWMA/CUSUM) tuned to each
      product, mold/die, and season to reduce false positives.
    - >-
      Causal analysis and feature attribution (e.g., SHAP, Granger, Bayesian
      nets) to rank likely contributors: process settings, raw material lots,
      recycled % content, ambient humidity/temp, maintenance events.
    - >-
      Prescriptive guidance library: operator checklists tied to top-ranked
      causes (e.g., inspect pentane injectors, adjust extruder zone 3 −8°C,
      increase mold steam pressure +0.2 bar).
    - >-
      Golden‑batch profiles and what‑if simulations to quantify expected impact
      on density/strength before making changes.
    - >-
      Real‑time alerts (SMS/email/MES inbox) with confidence scores and expected
      correction ranges; auto-create CMMS tickets for recurring causes.
    - >-
      Capability dashboards (Cp/Cpk, Ppk), yield/OEE impact, cost of poor
      quality (CoPQ), and savings tracking for continuous improvement.
    - >-
      Deployment options: secure cloud, on‑prem, or hybrid with offline
      buffering; role-based access and full audit trails.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Detect quality drift early and explain why. FoamGuard AI links anomalies in
    density/strength to specific process, material, and environmental drivers,
    then recommends targeted actions—cutting scrap 20–40%, improving first‑pass
    yield 5–10 points, and reducing troubleshooting time by 50%+ within 90 days.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A curated, foam‑specific causal knowledge base and prescriptive action
    library with quantified effect sizes, built from multi‑plant deployments and
    tied to seasonal/material variations—plus pre‑built connectors and
    golden‑batch templates that cut pilot time to <4 weeks and deliver
    measurable savings within 90 days.

  character: >-
    Quality and process engineers and plant managers at polystyrene foam
    (EPS/XPS) plants who must keep density and compressive strength in spec.
  problem: >-
    External: density/strength drift drives scrap, rework, and customer claims.
    Internal: teams chase causes across PLC, batch, and environment logs without
    clarity. Philosophical: making reliable foam shouldn’t depend on guesswork.
  guide: >-
    We understand foam lines are complex and sensitive. Our AI detects
    out-of-control density/strength trends and links anomalies to likely
    process, material, and environment drivers (e.g., steam pressure, extruder
    temps, bead moisture, ambient humidity), delivering secure, explainable
    insights.
  plan: >-
    - Connect: securely link PLC/MES/LIMS/ambient data and map tags.

    - Calibrate: backfill history, set control limits, and validate signals in a
    short pilot.

    - Run: receive real-time alerts with ranked root-cause suggestions and
    recommended checks.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: schedule a 30-minute demo or start a 4-week pilot with your data.
    Transitional: download a sample anomaly report and an ROI checklist.
  success: >-
    Stable density/strength, faster troubleshooting, reduced scrap and downtime,
    predictable releases, audit-ready traceability, and happier customers.
  failure: >-
    Ongoing drift, late detections, constant firefighting, wasted resin/energy,
    missed specs, compliance risk, and lost business.
