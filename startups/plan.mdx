leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual drywall/insulation takeoffs from PDFs are slow (4–12 hours per
      medium project) and error-prone, delaying bids and limiting the number of
      opportunities contractors can pursue.
    - >-
      Estimator shortages: small/mid-size contractors often lack dedicated
      estimators or over-rely on a single expert, creating bottlenecks and
      knowledge risk.
    - >-
      Inconsistent takeoff methods produce variable BOMs, waste factors, and
      labor assumptions, leading to margin erosion and change-order disputes.
    - >-
      Revisions (addenda) require redoing takeoffs; errors slip through when
      comparing plan versions manually.
    - >-
      Existing general-purpose tools (PlanSwift/Bluebeam/STACK) require
      extensive manual tracing/clicking and do not auto-generate assemblies,
      labor, or bid drafts for drywall/insulation specifics.
    - >-
      Vendor pricing and productivity factors are not linked; quoting requires
      manual exports, spreadsheets, or rekeying into accounting/PM systems.
    - >-
      Small jobs are unprofitable to bid due to time cost, causing lost revenue
      and strained GC relationships.
  solution:
    - >-
      Upload PDF plans (single or multi-sheet); auto-detect sheet scales,
      legends, and relevant layers (architectural, RCP, partition schedules).
    - >-
      AI extracts and classifies partition types from legends/schedules (e.g.,
      GWB Type X, STC ratings), maps them to assemblies, and detects linear wall
      segments per type; detects ceilings, soffits, shafts, and insulation zones
      (R-values, vapor barriers).
    - >-
      Quantifies: board area by thickness/type (4x8/4x10/4x12), tape/mud,
      screws, corner beads, backing, firestopping allowances; insulation square
      footage/cubic footage by R-value and type (batts, blown, rigid).
    - >-
      Applies configurable waste factors, labor productivity libraries
      (man-hours per LF/SF), and crew rates to produce a draft BOM and cost
      breakdown (materials, labor, equipment, OH&P).
    - >-
      Human-in-the-loop QA workspace: highlight mismatches, measure/trace
      corrections, lock assemblies; confidence scoring flags low-certainty areas
      for review.
    - >-
      Revision compare: overlay addenda, show delta quantities/costs,
      auto-generate change-order drafts.
    - >-
      One-click exports to Excel/CSV, QuickBooks Online/Enterprise items,
      Procore/Autodesk/Buildertrend budgets; shareable bid PDF with scope
      clarifications.
    - >-
      Project templates for recurring scopes (e.g., multifamily corridors, hotel
      rooms) and vendor-linked item catalogs for live pricing.
    - Activity log and audit trail for dispute resolution and internal training.
