  problem:
    - >-
      Finish carpentry contractors spend 2–6 hours per set of residential plans
      manually measuring base, crown, casing, wainscot, and stair trim using
      Bluebeam or scaled rulers, delaying bids and reducing win rates.
    - >-
      Manual takeoffs yield inconsistent accuracy (±10–25%) due to human error,
      plan complexity, and plan revisions, causing material overbuys/underbuys
      and margin leakage.
    - >-
      Small to mid-sized shops lack dedicated estimators; owners or lead
      carpenters do takeoffs at night/weekends, creating burnout and limiting
      capacity to bid more work.
    - >-
      Waste factors are applied as rough rules-of-thumb rather than optimized to
      stock lengths and cut patterns, increasing material costs by 5–12%.
    - >-
      Revisions and addenda require re-doing takeoffs; version control and
      change quantification are slow and error-prone.
    - >-
      Export from takeoffs to quotes and purchase orders is manual, duplicative
      data entry, and error-prone (mislabeling profiles, wrong LF carryover).
  solution:
    - >-
      AI-driven plan parsing to detect walls, openings, rooms, and trim scope by
      room/level from architectural sheets and schedules.
    - >-
      Automated extraction of linear footage for base, crown, chair rail,
      wainscot perimeter/area, window and door casing counts by type, and stair
      trim (skirts, handrails, balusters, newels) with profile assignment.
    - >-
      Waste optimization engine that converts linear footage to buy lists based
      on selected stock lengths (8/12/14/16 ft), cut patterns, and miter
      returns; configurable waste factors by material and profile (e.g., MDF vs.
      hardwood).
    - >-
      Rapid revision handling: plan version comparison highlights deltas by
      room/level and updates quantities in minutes.
    - >-
      One-click exports to Excel/CSV, QuickBooks Online item lists, and
      estimating templates; supplier-ready materials list with SKU mapping.
    - >-
      Confidence scoring, redline overlays, and an interactive review UI so
      users can quickly verify and adjust before finalizing.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    10-minute, audit-ready trim takeoffs from PDFs with optimized buy lists and
    waste factors tailored to stock lengths—improving accuracy to within ±5–10%
    and freeing 6–12 estimator hours per week to bid more and win more.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A specialized, growing dataset of trim-specific annotations and validated
    ground-truth takeoffs, combined with a waste optimization engine tuned to
    moulding stock lengths and supplier SKUs. Early partnerships with moulding
    distributors create distribution and SKU accuracy advantages that general
    takeoff tools lack.

  character: >-
    Finish carpentry contractors who need fast, accurate trim takeoffs (base,
    crown, casing, wainscot, stair trim) to bid confidently and order the right
    materials.
  problem: >-
    Manual PDF takeoffs are slow, error-prone, and tedious. Plan revisions force
    rework; mixed profiles by room/level are easy to miss; guessing waste risks
    shortages or overbuy. You’re tired of late nights with a scale and
    highlighter when your time should be on crews and clients.
  guide: >-
    We understand finish carpentry details and the cost of a missed foot of
    trim. Plan-to-Trim Takeoff AI is built for finish scopes, reading PDF plans
    to extract quantities and materials with transparent logic and editable
    assumptions, so you stay in control.
  plan: >-
    1) Upload PDF plans. 2) AI extracts linear feet and counts by
    room/level/profile and builds a materials list with your waste factors. 3)
    Review, adjust, and export to CSV/Excel or copy-paste into your estimate.
    Start with a sample project; get responsive support.
  callToAction: >-
    Upload a plan for a free sample takeoff, or book a 15‑minute demo to see it
    on your drawings.
  success: >-
    Bid faster with precise quantities, consistent waste factors, and clean
    exports. Place right-sized trim orders, reduce jobsite shortages and
    returns, hit schedules, and protect margins while winning more work.
  failure: >-
    Keep guessing footage, missing profile changes on revisions,
    over/under-ordering, scrambling on site, slipping schedules, and losing
    profitable bids to faster competitors.
