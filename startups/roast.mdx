  problem:
    - >-
      Flavor variability due to bean lot differences (origin, fermentation,
      moisture) causes inconsistent sensory outcomes and rework; first-pass
      flavor acceptance often <85% on variant changeovers.
    - >-
      Roast and conche setpoints are static recipes; operators manually tweak
      based on experience, leading to drift, long ramp-up times, and avoidable
      energy/time use.
    - >-
      Energy and cycle times are a major cost center; many plants lack
      real-time, multi-objective optimization across flavor, yield, and energy,
      limiting throughput and increasing CO2 footprint.
    - >-
      Limited instrumentation and siloed data (PLC/SCADA, LIMS, ERP) hinder
      closed-loop optimization and traceability from bean lot to finished mass.
    - >-
      Scaling talent is difficult; tribal process know-how is concentrated in a
      few experts, increasing operational risk and onboarding time.
    - >-
      QA/R&D sensory targets are not quantitatively translated to controllable
      process parameters, slowing product development and tech transfer between
      lines/sites.
  solution:
    - >-
      AI decision-support that maps bean lot attributes and in-process signals
      to recommended roast curve and conche parameters, balancing flavor score,
      yield, and energy/cycle time.
    - >-
      Edge-connected to PLC/SCADA (OPC UA/Modbus) and plant historians; optional
      closed-loop control with guardrails and supervisor overrides.
    - >-
      Flavor model trained on paired datasets: bean metadata
      (origin/fermentation/moisture), process telemetry (T/RH/airflow/energy
      draw/torque), VOC/NIR fingerprints, and sensory panel or GC-MS proxies.
    - >-
      Experiment Design (DoE) module to quickly calibrate new beans/recipes with
      3–6 smart trials vs 15–25 traditional trials.
    - >-
      Continuous learning with A/B or adaptive control to track drift (equipment
      wear, seasonal bean shifts) and auto-adjust within approved ranges.
    - >-
      Audit-ready reports: flavor conformance, kWh/ton, cycle time, yield, CO2e
      per ton, with lot-level traceability and recipe/version control.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Hit target flavor profiles with fewer trial batches while reducing energy
    and cycle time—AI that turns bean-lot variability into predictable,
    efficient roast/conche setpoints, with measurable savings and auditable
    flavor conformance.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    A domain-specific flavor model and control library trained on paired
    bean–process–sensory datasets across multiple OEMs, plus OEM/SI integrations
    and DoE playbooks that cut calibration trials by 60–80%—difficult for
    general-purpose AI or new entrants to replicate quickly.

    Ops leaders and process/R&D managers at chocolate and confectionery plants
    (NAICS 311351) who must hit flavor specs and throughput targets while
    reducing energy, waste, and trial-and-error.
  problem: >-
    - External: Bean variability and equipment drift make roast/conche setpoints
    guesswork; trials tie up lines, burn energy, and hurt yield.

    - Internal: Constant pressure to deliver consistent flavor and OEE with
    tight margins and sustainability goals.

    - Philosophical: Craft-quality chocolate shouldn’t rely on wasteful
    experimentation—data should guide the roast and conche.
  guide: >-
    - Empathy: We know balancing flavor, efficiency, and schedule on a live line
    is hard.

    - Authority: Built by food process engineers and data scientists with cocoa
    expertise; integrates with roaster/conche PLCs, LIMS, and SCADA; secure,
    audit-ready data practices.
  plan: >-
    - Process plan: (1) Connect PLC/SCADA, bean lot metadata, and QC/sensory
    data. (2) Train flavor–yield–energy models and map target profiles to
    optimal setpoints. (3) Deliver operator-in-the-loop or closed-loop
    recommendations; monitor and refine.

    - Agreement plan: Start with a 4–6 week pilot on one line/recipe; clear
    success criteria; operator override and safety limits; defined data
    ownership and privacy.
  callToAction: >-
    - Direct: Schedule a demo and launch a pilot.

    - Transitional: Download the flavor optimization playbook; request an ROI
    estimate; get a variability audit.
  success: |-
    - Consistent, on-spec flavor by bean lot.
