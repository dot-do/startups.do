leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual dock scheduling (phone/email/portals) consumes 2–6 labor hours per
      site per day, creates errors, and makes it hard to enforce dock
      constraints (door capacity, equipment type, hazmat).
    - >-
      Gate check-in is slow and inconsistent; drivers often wait 10–20 minutes
      to register, causing congestion, lost productivity, and detention claims.
    - >-
      Little real-time visibility or predictive ETA adjustment leads to missed
      slots, under/over-utilized doors, and avoidable overtime.
    - >-
      Carrier experience is fragmented across multiple portals; adoption is low
      when apps are required, increasing no-shows and rework.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trails (who arrived when, documents, safety
      confirmations) are incomplete or paper-based, making KPI tracking and
      root-cause analysis difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve appointment scheduling for carriers via link/SMS; dynamic
      slotting enforces door capacity, equipment, commodity, temperature/hazmat
      rules.
    - >-
      Driver self check-in at gate via QR signage or SMS short code; bot
      verifies PO/PRO/reference, collects required documents, and issues
      door/instructions automatically.
    - >-
      Predictive ETA and reslotting using visibility/ELD/geofencing data;
      auto-notify warehouse when trucks are inbound/late/early with suggested
      slot adjustments.
    - >-
      Configurable rules engine for doors, labor shifts, work content (pallets,
      live/unload, drop), dwell targets, and SLA priorities per client.
    - >-
      Audit-quality event log and analytics: check-in/out times, door dwell,
      no-shows, detention exposure, carrier scorecards.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box integrations to common WMS/TMS/YMS and telematics;
      webhook/API for custom workflows; kiosk fallback if phones are restricted.
    - >-
      Multilingual bot (EN/ES + extendable) and safety/compliance prompts
      (C-TPAT steps, PPE acknowledgement).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Frictionless, AI-driven dock scheduling and SMS/QR self check-in that
    compresses gate time from minutes to seconds, raises door utilization, and
    reduces dwell and labor—no app required for carriers or drivers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Network effects and data moat: every driver/carrier using SMS/QR across
    sites improves identity matching and dwell prediction. Frictionless no-app
    UX boosts adoption versus portal-based tools, and prebuilt WMS/TMS/YMS
    connectors cut time-to-value to weeks, not months.
