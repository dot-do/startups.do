  title: Dock/Yard Appointment & Gate Bot
  description: >-
    Automates dock scheduling with carriers and manages driver self check-in via
    SMS/QR.
  targetUsers:
    - Receiving/shipping coordinator
    - Yard manager
  triggers:
    - Inbound/outbound load created
    - Carrier request email/SMS
    - ETA changes
  inputs:
    - Load/ASN details
    - Door capacity and blackout windows
    - Carrier contacts
    - 'ETA feeds (e.g., project44/FourKites)'
  steps:
    - Offer appointment slots based on constraints
    - Confirm with carriers via email/SMS; calendar sync
    - Driver gate bot collects PO/Trailer/Seal on arrival
    - Notify team; assign door; update WMS/TMS
    - Auto-reschedule on ETA delays and re-optimize door plan
  tools:
    - Calendar API
    - SMS (Twilio)
    - Email
    - TMS/visibility APIs
    - WMS dock/yard endpoints
  outputs:
    - Live dock calendar
    - Driver check-in transcripts
    - Door assignment updates
  pricingModel:
    - Per-appointment fee
    - Monthly base
    - Setup fee
  humanInLoop: false
  feasibility:
    remoteOnLaptop: 5
    modelCapability: 4.5
    overall: 4.6
  risks:
    - Driver connectivity issues
    - Overbooking from stale ETAs
    - Carrier adoption/behavior change
  dependencies:
    - SMS number and templates
    - TMS or visibility feed
    - WMS dock management access
leanCanvas:
  problem:
    - >-
      Manual dock scheduling (phone/email/portals) consumes 2–6 labor hours per
      site per day, creates errors, and makes it hard to enforce dock
      constraints (door capacity, equipment type, hazmat).
    - >-
      Gate check-in is slow and inconsistent; drivers often wait 10–20 minutes
      to register, causing congestion, lost productivity, and detention claims.
    - >-
      Little real-time visibility or predictive ETA adjustment leads to missed
      slots, under/over-utilized doors, and avoidable overtime.
    - >-
      Carrier experience is fragmented across multiple portals; adoption is low
      when apps are required, increasing no-shows and rework.
    - >-
      Compliance and audit trails (who arrived when, documents, safety
      confirmations) are incomplete or paper-based, making KPI tracking and
      root-cause analysis difficult.
  solution:
    - >-
      Self-serve appointment scheduling for carriers via link/SMS; dynamic
      slotting enforces door capacity, equipment, commodity, temperature/hazmat
      rules.
    - >-
      Driver self check-in at gate via QR signage or SMS short code; bot
      verifies PO/PRO/reference, collects required documents, and issues
      door/instructions automatically.
    - >-
      Predictive ETA and reslotting using visibility/ELD/geofencing data;
      auto-notify warehouse when trucks are inbound/late/early with suggested
      slot adjustments.
    - >-
      Configurable rules engine for doors, labor shifts, work content (pallets,
      live/unload, drop), dwell targets, and SLA priorities per client.
    - >-
      Audit-quality event log and analytics: check-in/out times, door dwell,
      no-shows, detention exposure, carrier scorecards.
    - >-
      Out-of-the-box integrations to common WMS/TMS/YMS and telematics;
      webhook/API for custom workflows; kiosk fallback if phones are restricted.
    - >-
      Multilingual bot (EN/ES + extendable) and safety/compliance prompts
      (C-TPAT steps, PPE acknowledgement).
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Frictionless, AI-driven dock scheduling and SMS/QR self check-in that
    compresses gate time from minutes to seconds, raises door utilization, and
    reduces dwell and labor—no app required for carriers or drivers.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Network effects and data moat: every driver/carrier using SMS/QR across
    sites improves identity matching and dwell prediction. Frictionless no-app
    UX boosts adoption versus portal-based tools, and prebuilt WMS/TMS/YMS
    connectors cut time-to-value to weeks, not months.

  character: >-
    Operations leaders at 3PL and storage facilities (NAICS 493190)—warehouse,
    yard, and gate teams who must keep docks full and trucks moving.
  problem: >-
    External: Phone/email scheduling, walk-ups, and paper gate logs create
    missed slots, long queues, and detention fees. Internal: Teams are stressed
    by constant fire-fighting and after-hours calls. Philosophical: Booking a

    playbooks, integrations with common WMS/TMS/YMS, and transparent audit
    trails so your team stays in control.
  plan: >-
    Process: 1) Connect carriers and calendars; 2) Configure rules (dock hours,
    commodities, SLAs); 3) Turn on SMS/QR self check-in and exception handling;
    4) Monitor slots, yard status, and ETAs from one dashboard. Agreement:
    simple monthly pricing, quick pilot, bring-your-own phone—no kiosks
    required.
  callToAction: >-
    Direct: Book a 20-minute demo or start a 30-day pilot. Transitional: Get the
    dock ROI checklist and sample SOPs.
  success: >-
    Accurate schedules, shorter gate dwell, fewer calls, steady dock
    utilization, clear ETAs and yard visibility, automatic logs for audits,
    happier carriers, lower detention/demurrage, and more turns per door.
  failure: >-
    Keep bleeding time and fees to missed appointments, gate lines, manual
    errors, and frustrated drivers—risking overtime, customer scorecards, and
    lost capacity.

  problem:
    - Phone and email back-and-forth to book doors slows carriers and planners
    - Gate lines and paper logs drive dwell and detention costs
    - Unpredictable arrivals overwhelm docks while other slots sit empty
    - 'Limited visibility into ETAs, yard status, and door availability'
    - 'Manual check-in causes errors, language barriers, and safety risks'
    - Missed time windows and late reschedules disrupt labor planning
    - 'Data scattered across WMS/TMS, spreadsheets, and radios'
    - High admin overhead per load; after-hours coverage is inconsistent
  solution:
    - Always-on AI bot books appointments directly with carriers
    - 'Smart capacity calendar levels loads by door, equipment, and SLA'
    - Drivers self check-in/out via SMS or QR; no app required
    - 'Gate bot verifies load info and documents, then assigns a door'
    - 'Live ETA tracking and alerts keep ops, carriers, and customers aligned'
    - Auto rescheduling and waitlist fill cancellations in real time
    - 'Single system of record with audit trail, KPIs, and detention tracking'
    - 'Fast rollout: use standalone or integrate with WMS/TMS/YMS'
  features:
    - 'Two-way carrier booking via link, SMS, or email'
    - 'Rules engine for time windows, commodities, temp-control, trailer types'
    - Door and door-group capacity with equipment constraints
    - 'Priority logic for live vs drop, inbound vs outbound'
    - Geofenced arrival detection and dynamic ETA updates
    - QR codes for guard shack and driver kiosks
    - 'Document capture: BOL, IDs, lumper receipts, photos'
    - Automatic door assignment and dock call notifications
    - 'Real-time yard board: scheduled, at gate, at dock, loaded, departed'
    - 'Detention timers, SLA thresholds, and exception alerts'
    - Multi-site management and role-based access controls
    - Bilingual driver flows (English/Spanish) with configurable languages
    - Webhooks and native connectors for major WMS/TMS/YMS
    - 'Analytics: dwell, turn time, utilization, no-show rate'
    - 'SSO, permissions, and audit logging for compliance'
  steps:
    - Connect your WMS/TMS or start standalone
    - 'Set dock capacities, door groups, time windows, and rules'
    - 'Share booking link or QR with carriers (rate con, email, portal)'
    - Carrier selects a slot; bot confirms and sends driver instructions
    - 'Driver arrives, scans QR or texts; gate bot verifies and assigns a door'
    - Statuses and alerts flow to ops and systems; exceptions are escalated
    - Review KPIs and fine-tune rules to continuously reduce dwell
