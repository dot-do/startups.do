  problem:
    - >-
      Advisors and operations teams spend 2–5 hours per new household on
      duplicative KYC, risk profiling, custodian forms, and IPS drafting,
      slowing conversion and increasing costs.
    - >-
      High NIGO (not-in-good-order) rates (10–25% for many firms) cause rework,
      poor client experience, and compliance risk.
    - >-
      Risk tolerance assessments are inconsistent across advisors and tools; IPS
      documents vary in quality and auditability, creating supervisory burden.
    - >-
      Fragmented stack (CRM, custodian portals, e-sign, planning, risk tools)
      requires manual data re-entry and creates data quality issues.
    - >-
      KYC/AML rules and disclosures vary by jurisdiction and custodian; staying
      current is time-consuming and risky.
    - >-
      Annual KYC refreshes and IPS updates are manual and often missed, leading
      to compliance gaps.
    - >-
      Limited visibility into onboarding bottlenecks and compliance exceptions
      prevents continuous improvement and regulatory readiness.
  solution:
    - >-
      Conversational, white-labeled client intake that captures demographics,
      financials, goals, and consents; dynamic forms adapt by product,
      jurisdiction, and custodian.
    - >-
      Built-in KYC/AML workflow: ID verification (IDV), sanctions/PEP screening,
      watchlist checks, and CIP record-keeping with automated evidence logs and
      exception routing.
    - >-
      Hybrid risk profiling (psychometrics + scenario capacity/need) calibrated
      to firm policy; explains outcomes in plain language for clients and
      advisors.
    - >-
      AI-assisted IPS drafting engine: uses firm-approved templates, product
      lists, and policy rules to generate a complete, explainable IPS and
      investment strategy summary for advisor review and e-signature.
    - >-
      Custodian and e-sign automation: pre-fill and validate account
      applications (individual, joint, IRA, trust) and ACATs; prevent NIGO via
      rules and real-time validation.
    - >-
      Supervisor dashboard for review, redlining, and approvals; immutable audit
      trails and version control for IPS and KYC artifacts.
    - >-
      API/Integrations: bidirectional sync with CRM, planning tools, and
      portfolio systems; auto-schedule KYC refreshes and IPS reviews based on
      risk and regulatory rules.
  uniqueValueProp: >-
    Automated, audit-ready client onboarding and IPS drafting that reduces
    time-to-open by 70%, lowers NIGO by 50%+, and standardizes compliant IPS
    outputs—all while keeping advisors in control and integrated with their
    existing custodian, CRM, and planning stack.
  unfairAdvantage: >-
    Regulatory-grade rules engine and IPS template library mapped to firm
    policies and custodian requirements, combined with data network effects from
    aggregated (anonymized) onboarding flows that improve NIGO prevention and
    IPS quality over time; preferred integrations with custodians/CRMs and SOC 2
    Type II posture reduce procurement friction and copycat risk.
